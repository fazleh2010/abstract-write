Cinna's influence in Rome exacerbated the tensions which existed between Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. After the death of Marius, he became the leading power in Rome until his own death. His main impact upon Roman politics was his ability to veil his tyranny and make it appear that he was working under a constitutional government. His policies also impinged on Julius Caesar, who married his daughter."

  "text" : "Loretta L. Sánchez (born January 7, 1960) is the U.S. Representative for California's 46th congressional district, serving in Congress since 1997. After an unsuccessful early entry into politics as a Republican running under her married name Loretta Brixey for city council in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Palos Verdes Estates, she changed her party affiliation and rebranded herself under her maiden name to first be elected in 1996, when she defeated long-serving GOP congressman Bob Dornan by fewer than 1,000 votes. Sánchez represented the 46th district from 1997 to 2003, then California's 47th congressional district from 2003 to 2013, and again in the 46th district from 2013 to the present. The district lies in central Orange County. Since 1996, Sánchez has been a member of the Democratic Party, and of the House Blue Dog Coalition. Instead of running for re-election to the House in November 2016, Sánchez is running in the U.S. Senate race in California and is one of two candidates to reach the general election for that seat. If she wins she will be the first Latina ever to serve in the United States Senate."

  "text" : "Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus (519–430 BC) was a Roman aristocrat and statesman whose service as consul in 460 BC and dictator in 458 BC and 439 BC made him a model of civic virtue. Cincinnatus was regarded by the Romans, especially the aristocratic patrician class, as one of the heroes of early Rome and as a model of Roman virtue and simplicity. He was a persistent opponent of the plebeians. When his son, Caeso Quinctius, was convicted and condemned to death, Cincinnatus was forced to live in humble circumstances, working on his own small farm, until an invasion caused him to be called to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he resigned two weeks later, after completing his task of defeating the rival tribes of the Aequians, Sabines, and Volscians. His immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of the crisis has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, civic virtue, lack of personal ambition, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, many of which are named in his honor."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Li.) Li Hongzhang, GCVO (also romanised as Li Hung-chang) (15 February 1823 – 7 November 1901) was a Chinese politician, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty. He quelled several major rebellions and served in important positions in the Qing imperial court, including the Viceroy of Zhili Province. Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonized the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favor with the Chinese after their loss in the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military mistakes and praise on the other for his success against the Taiping Rebellion, his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernization. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria."

  "text" : "Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon PC SL KC (5 October 1732 – 4 April 1802) was a British politician and barrister, who served as Attorney General, Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice. Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with John Dunning, who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and Lord Thurlow who secured for him the Chief Justiceship of Chester in 1780. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon the same year, serving repeatedly as Attorney General under William Pitt the Younger. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of Charles James Fox, and was rewarded with a baronetcy; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP. On 27 March 1784 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said \"I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all\". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work \"restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law\". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802."

After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, he served in the United States Air Force, where he reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He was first appointed to the State Assembly in 1985 to fill the 50th District seat vacated by Charles Hughes' resignation. He served nine terms and was seeking re-election for a tenth (to the newly established 117th District) when he died in late October 2002. Because his name remained on the ballot and he received a majority of votes cast, the local Republican party named his widow, Carolyn K. Justus, to fill his seat. The western campus of the North Carolina Justice Academy was named the Larry T. Justus Western Justice Academy in his honor in 2004."

  "text" : "The Honourable Lynda Maureen Haverstock, CM, SOM (born September 16, 1948) is the former leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and served as the 19th Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan from 2000 until July 2006. In 2007, she was named President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan. Born Lynda Maureen Ham and raised in Swift Current, Haverstock left high school after grade 10 to raise her infant daughter. As an adult, she returned to school to finish her education, and ultimately earned bachelor's and master's degrees in education, as well as a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Saskatchewan. Haverstock rose to the forefront of the provincial Liberals in 1989 and was the first woman in Saskatchewan's history to lead a political party. She brought the Liberals to realize a healthy increase in support, taking over 23 per cent of the vote in the 1991 provincial election. However, their numbers were spread too thinly across the province to translate into seats. Haverstock was the only Liberal to win a seat, in Saskatoon Greystone. Under her leadership, the party grew significantly: in the 1995 provincial election, it increased its caucus in the Legislative Assembly to eleven, becoming the Official Opposition. The Liberals captured one-third of the popular vote. Faced with of a coalition of Regina Liberals and former Tories who had unsuccessfully challenged her leadership, Haverstock resigned as leader in 1995. She spent the remainder of her legislative term as an independent member. In 1999, she retired from politics. The Liberal Party continued to be divided by internal fighting and several members of the Legislative Assembly, including those who had opposed Haverstock, left in 1997 to join the Saskatchewan Party. The 1999 provincial election reduced the Liberals to three seats in the legislature. Since 2003, they have failed to elect any members. After leaving politics, Haverstock worked briefly as a radio host before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan in 2000. As the Queen's representative, she was instrumental in organizing the province's centennial celebrations in 2005. Haverstock's term in office was extended and she remained Lieutenant Governor until July 31, 2006. During her tenure, she granted patronage to over one-hundred community-based organisations. Dr. Lynda Haverstock is a member of the Order of Canada and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and has honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Regina, Royal Roads University (Victoria), and Queen's University (Kingston). She is a recipient of the Distinguished Canadian Award and is named among the University of Saskatchewan's 100 Alumni of Influence. In June 2007, she became President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan, an arms-length, industry-driven authority responsible, in part, for marketing Saskatchewan as a destination. She has been successful in raising the profile of the organization and broadening awareness of Saskatchewan's tourism sector. Under her direction, the province's first Summit on Tourism was held in September 2007; six President's Task Teams were formed to provide guidance on key challenges and issues; a Quality Assurance Program for the sector was introduced; and the first Tourism Advocacy Day at the provincial legislature was held in November 2011. Between 2006 and 2010, the province's tourism revenues rose from $1.44 billion to $1.68 billion, and increase of 13.5 per cent. Dr. Haverstock sits on the Board of Directors for Shaw Communications. She and her husband Harley Olsen (former CEO of the Office of the Provincial Capital Commission and former Deputy Minister of Municipal Affairs) have four children and nine grandchildren. Her brother Dennis Ham sat as a Conservative in the Saskatchewan assembly."

  "text" : "Lawrence James Springborg (born 17 February 1968) is an Australian politician. He is a sitting member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and a former leader of the Liberal National Party of Queensland. As Leader of the Queensland branch of the National Party, he led the National-Liberal coalition to defeats at both the 2004 and 2006 Queensland elections. He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him. Following this defeat Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party's first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office. On 6 May 2016, Springborg lost the leadership of the LNP to Tim Nicholls."

  "text" : "Edward Leslie Burgin (13 July 1887 – 16 August 1945) was a British Liberal and later Liberal National politician in the 1930s. Born to Edward Lambert Burgin, a solicitor, Burgin studied law at the University of London, graduating with a first-class LL.B. in 1908 and a LL.D. in 1913. Burgin trained as a solicitor specialising in international law and served as principal and director of legal studies to the Law Society. He contested Hornsey four times and East Ham North once, without success. In the 1929 general election Burgin was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Luton. Along with other Liberal MPs he joined the Liberal Nationals in 1931 and was made a Charity Commissioner. In 1932 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1937 Coronation Honours. In 1937 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Burgin as Minister of Transport. Two years later he was appointed as the first Minister of Supply in April 1939. As the post had not yet been established in law, he formally served as Minister without Portfolio for the first three months. His appointment was aimed to appeal to liberal minded opinion but was criticised as being inappropriate - A.J.P. Taylor described Burgin as being \"another horse from Caligula's well-stocked stables\" (a follow-up to contemporary remarks about the earlier appointment of Sir Thomas Inskip as Minister for Coordination of Defence). When Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, Burgin was not included in the new ministry."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Edward Cavendish (28 January 1838 – 18 May 1891) was a 19th-century British politician. Born in Marylebone, Cavendish was the third son of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, by his wife, Lady Blanche Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (a daughter of the 6th Earl of Carlisle and a niece of the 6th Duke of Devonshire). His father and his two surviving brothers were all Members of Parliament (MPs): his eldest brother Spencer, MP for North Lancashire 1857–91 and later 8th Duke of Devonshire, led the Liberal Party and was asked three times to be Prime Minister by Queen Victoria; the middle brother, Frederick was MP for the West Riding and Chief Secretary for Ireland and was assassinated in 1882. Cavendish was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade. On retirement from the regular army he joined the 2nd Derbyshire Militia (later the Sherwood Foresters), but transferred to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment in 1888. Cavendish served as MP for West Derbyshire from the creation of the constituency until his death. Like his eldest brother, he became a Liberal Unionist in reaction to the Liberal Party's policy on Irish Home Rule. Upon his death in Marylebone aged 53, his son, Victor, was elected unopposed to replace him, later becoming the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish married his cousin Emma Lascelles, a daughter of the Rt. Hon. William Lascelles, on 3 August 1865. They had three sons: \n*  1) Victor Christian William Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire (1868–1938) \n*  2) Lord Richard Frederick Cavendish MP (1871–1946) \n*  3) Lord John Spencer Cavendish (1875–1914) was killed in action in World War I."

  "text" : "Lillian Eva Quan Dyck (born August 24, 1945) is a Canadian senator from Saskatchewan. She was appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Paul Martin on March 24, 2005. Upon appointment, Dyck wished to sit as a New Democratic Party senator, but NDP spokesperson Karl Belanger immediately indicated that the party would not recognize her as a member of the NDP caucus: as the party platform specifically favours abolition of the Senate, it refused to confer legitimacy on the body by accepting Dyck; additionally, Dyck's membership in the NDP was revealed to have lapsed. Under the rules of the Senate, senators are free to designate themselves however they see fit, and Dyck changed her designation to say Independent New Democratic Party. On January 15, 2009, she joined the Liberal Senate caucus. On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Dyck, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus. Before being appointed to the Senate, Dyck was a neuroscientist with the University of Saskatchewan, where she was also associate dean. On March 12, 1999, Dyck, who is of Cree and Chinese heritage and was one of the first Aboriginal women in Canada to pursue an academic career in the sciences, was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Indspire. She continues to teach at the university as well as conduct research on a part-time basis. She is a member of the Gordon First Nation. In 2014 Dyck accused Conservative MP Rob Clarke, who is also native, of \"behaving like a white man\" by pushing the Indian Act Amendment and Replacement Act. She later said she recognized the comment could be hurtful."

  "text" : "Lorne Mayencourt is a Canadian politician, who formerly represented the electoral district of Vancouver-Burrard in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a member of the BC Liberal party. Mayencourt was first elected in the 2001 provincial election, defeating New Democrat opponent Tim Stevenson. He was previously the founder and, for its first five years, executive director of the Vancouver Friends for Life Society, which supports people living with AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. He is the founder of the BC New Hope Recovery Society and Baldy Hughes Therapeutic Community in North Central BC which supports addicts in a long-term recovery community. In the 2005 election, conflicting results throughout the night had both Mayencourt and Stevenson declared the victor in Vancouver-Burrard, and the uncertainty continued for several weeks. In the final count of regular ballots, Stevenson was declared the winner by 17 votes; however, when absentee ballots were counted on May 30, Mayencourt was declared the winner by a margin of 18 votes. After a judicial recount, Mayencourt was declared the victor by 11 votes. He is known for his Private Member's Bill called the Safe Streets Act (2004), which aimed to deter aggressive panhandling. He chaired the provincial Safe Schools Task Force (2003) and introduced the Safe Schools Act (2005) to combat bullying in the school system based on racism, sexism and homophobia. He introduced the Apology Act to facilitate sincere and timely reconciliation between government, business and citizens. Mayencourt announced that he would not run in the 2009 provincial election, and resigned early to run as the Conservative Party of Canada's candidate in Vancouver Centre for the 2008 general election. He lost to incumbent Liberal MP Hedy Fry. Mayencourt announced that he would seek the BC Liberal Party nomination in the riding of Vancouver-False Creek for the British Columbia general election, 2013 after the current incumbent Mary McNeil announced she would not be seeking another term. His main competition is Sam Sullivan. Mayencourt currently lives in Vancouver, B.C."

  "text" : "Dr. Ludwig Landmann (May 18, 1868 in Mannheim – March 5, 1945 in Voorburg, Netherlands) was a liberal German politician of the Weimar Republic. Landmann belonged first to the National Social party, then the Progressive People's Party, and finally, after the German revolution of 1918, the German Democratic Party. He eventually moved from Mannheim to Frankfurt, where he became Mayor of Frankfurt from 1924 until 1933 and led a significant expansion of the city. Through reorganizations and construction, Landmann gave the city new luster. Landmann was the first Jewish mayor of Frankfurt. At the time he was mayor he hired the architect Ernst May to organize a new housing project, which became known as the New Frankfurt (Neues Frankfurt). Landmann founded also the Nassau home (Nassauische Heimstätte), an organization that helped guarantee every citizen had access to decent housing. After the Nazi election victory in the municipal elections on March 12, 1933, he was expelled from his office. He then handed in his official resignation as mayor. He was succeeded by Friedrich Krebs of the NSDAP. Landmann left then for Berlin. But because of his Jewish ancestry, he was exposed to various antisemitic Nazi harassment; among other things, his pension payments were temporarily stopped. In 1939, he left Germany and emigrated to the Netherlands, the home of his wife. After the German occupation of the Netherlands from 1940, he was hidden by relatives and friends to protect him from deportation, and possible death. He died in 1945 in hiding from malnutrition during Holland's 'Hunger Winter'. Today Ludwig Landmann Street in Frankfurt is dedicated to his memory. A portrait of the mayor by William Runze, a painter from the Sossenheim district of Frankfurt, hangs in the Council Hall at the Römer, Frankfurt's City Hall."

Born and raised in Arizona, he was the son of David King Udall, a politician, and Eliza Stewart Udall, the first telegraph operator in the Arizona Territory. He was named after his grandfather, Levi Stewart. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1914 he married Louisa Lee, a granddaughter of John D. Lee and Jacob Hamblin. They would later have six children. He passed the Arizona Bar exam in 1922, and was admitted to the bar, without having earned a law degree (a common practice in those days). Later that year he succeeded his father as stake president of the St. Johns Stake, a position he held until 1945. In 1922, he lost a bid to be elected as clerk to the Arizona Superior Court. He was defeated by his older brother John Hunt Udall. In 1946 he was elected to the Arizona Supreme Court, and remained a Justice of that court from 1947 until his death. In 1948 Udall wrote the majority opinion of the Arizona State Supreme Court granting Native Americans living on reservations the right to vote. From 1951-1952 and 1957-1958 he served as the Chief Justice of that court. In 1960 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Arizona. He died on May 30 of that year."

She studied law at the University of Athens. In 1973, starting her career in journalism, she was acclaimed by Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis as the \"kid of New Democracy\", a designation she herself denied a while later. In the next decades Kanelli worked as daily columnist, reporter at home and on missions abroad, news anchor, broadcaster, television presenter and interviewer to evolve by time into a kind of a Greek \"Barbara Walters\". Often playing the role of media polemicist, she is noted for her forthright, irreverent, incisive and arrogant style of talking criticised or applauded by either party of the viewers. In 1999, Kanelli announced from the podium of a rally protesting the Kosovo War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that she would run as a candidate for the Communist Party of Greece for the European Parliament. In the 2000 national election she was firstly elected as Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens' first electoral district, and has secured a seat in all the next elections of 2004, 2007 and 2009. In June 2012, during a live talk show, Kanelli was struck three times in the shoulders and the face by Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris. Kanelli had smacked his arm with her purse after Kasidiaris threw papers across the news desk at the interviewer. Apart from Greek, Kanelli is also fluent in three foreign languages: English, French and Italian."

  "text" : "Leszek Moczulski (Polish pronunciation: [ˈlɛʂɛk mɔˈtʂulskʲi], born 7 June 1930) is a Polish historian and politician, a member of various organizations, first supporting then supposedly opposing the communist regime in the People's Republic of Poland while dividing the opposition movement. Leszek Moczulski was born June 7, 1930 in Warsaw. Shortly after the war and the Communist take-over of power in Poland, Moczulski became involved in various communist organizations. In 1947 he became a member of the Association of Fighting Youth and the following year he became the member of the Polish Workers' Party and the ZMP youth organization. Then since 1950 young Moczulski was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP). In 1951 he graduated from the Academy of Political Studies, a school of cadres for the communist regime. The following year he graduated also from the faculties of Law and Journalism at the Warsaw University. He completed his education in 1958 by graduating from the faculty of history at the same university. About that time he started to work as a journalist for various Warsaw-based newspapers and weeklies, among them the Życie Warszawy, Dookoła Świata and Stolica weekly. As a historian, Moczulski focused mostly on modern history of Poland, including the history of the Polish Defensive War. Initially, according to the Polish lustration court, a secret informer of the Służba Bezpieczeństwa secret political police, in late 1970s Moczulski most probably broke up (or just the opposite) with the regime and started working for various anti-communist associations. He was one of the inspirers of the creation and the spokesperson of the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights. Conflicted with the rest of the members, he tried to break it up by forming a ZINO faction, which was however unsuccessful. Finally, on September 1, 1979 Moczulski announced the creation of the Confederation of Independent Poland. As a politician, Moczulski referred to the rightist wing of the pre-war Sanacja and the supporters of Józef Piłsudski. In his political works he focused mostly on economical aspect of the possible transformation of Communist planned economy into free market economy. Among the most notable of his actions of the 1980s was a memorandum of February 1985, in which he urged the governments of United Kingdom and the United States to fulfill the promises of the Yalta Conference of 1945 and organise free elections in Poland. For such actions, Moczulski was arrested several times and held in prisons as a political prisoner. After the Round Table Talks and the peaceful transfer of power from the communist regime to the democratic authorities, Moczulski distanced himself from the agreement and openly criticised the idea of gruba kreska, instead supporting an idea of decommunization, a concept coined after the post-World War II de-nazification of Nazi Germany. He also stayed off the Solidarity movement. He failed to gain enough support in the Kraków-Podgórze constituency for his candidacy to the Sejm in the Contract elections of 1989. The following year he took part in the presidential elections scoring 2.50% of votes. In the Polish parliamentary elections of 1991 he became a member of the parliament. He held his post in the elections of 1993. During his membership, he was a president of various commissions, including the commissions responsible for foreign policies, for support of Polonia, as well as the commission working on the project of the new constitution. Moczulski also took part in the presidential election of 1995, though he withdrew his candidacy. In 1992, during the last days of the government of Jan Olszewski, Moczulski was accused by Antoni Macierewicz of being one of the secret agents of the Służba Bezpieczeństwa (SB), a communist secret police. In 1997 Moczulski himself asked the lustration tribunal to investigate the matter. However, contrary to his predictions, he was found guilty of hiding his collaboration with the SB during the period 1969-1977, which ended his political career."

  "text" : "Lord Arthur John Edward Russell (14 June 1825 – 4 April 1892) was a British Liberal Party politician. He was born in London on 14 June 1825, the second of three sons of Major-General Lord George William Russell and Elizabeth Anne Rawdon, daughter of the Hon. John Theophilus Rawdon, himself second son of the 1st Earl of Moira. His elder brother was Francis, later 9th Duke of Bedford and his younger brother was Odo, later 1st Baron Ampthill. He was educated in Germany and from 1849 to 1854 he was private Secretary to his uncle, the Liberal Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Between 1857 and 1885, he sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock. He only spoke rarely in the Commons, once in reply to an attack on his brother Odo. On 25 September 1865, Russell married Laura de Peyronnet, daughter of Paul Louis Jules, Vicomte de Peyronnet. They had six children, Harold Russell, Flora Russell, the diplomat Sir Claud Russell, Caroline Russell, Major Gilbert Russell and Conrad Russell. He was raised to the rank of a Duke's son on 25 June 1872 and was then known as Lord Arthur Russell. He was a great clubman and belonged to Brooks's, the Athenaeum, the Cosmopolitan, Grillion's, THE CLUB, and the Metaphysical Society. He was involved in the Senate of the University of London, serving on this body from 1875 to his death. Russell died on 4 April 1892 at 2 Audley Square, London, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. There is a memorial to him in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael’s Church, Chenies. The ideological gulf between Britain and the new German Empire was stressed by Lord Russell in 1872: Prussia now represents all that is most antagonistic to the liberal and democratic ideas of the age; military despotism, the rule of the sword, contempt for sentimental talk, indifference to human suffering, imprisonment of independent opinion, transfer by force of unwilling populations to a hateful yoke, disregard of European opinion, total want of greatness and generosity, etc., etc.\""

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Northwest Territories in 1995 and served until Nunavut was created in 1999. Barnabas served as the first Speaker in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. In 1999 he was elected to the 1st Legislative Assembly of Nunavut but had to resign in August 2000 after being convicted of sexual assault. The conviction came at the same time as James Arvaluk was charged with assault against his girl friend. He pleaded guilty and resigned. The two scandals rocked the new government, and caused a substantial drop in positive public opinion. The resignation led to the first by-election in Nunavut history. Barnabas ran in the December 2000 by-election but was defeated by Rebekah Williams. He ran again in the 2004 Nunavut election in a hotly contested race and defeated Williams by doubling her vote count."

Often the male is charged even though the conflict may have been initiated by the female partner.\" Three days after Taparadjuk's e-mail was sent, Premier Eva Aariak removed him as Minister of Justice, saying, \"This government does not condone violence against women or men in any way, for any reason, which the line seems to imply.\" Source: 1 and 2"

He also wrote poems to try to discourage Cao Rui from military and palace-building projects. When the rival state Eastern Wu's emperor Sun Quan attacked Hefei in 234, according to Records of the Three Kingdoms, it was at Liu Shao's suggestion that Cao Rui sent his forces to try to cut off Sun Quan's supply route, rather than engage Sun Quan directly, a strategy that forced Sun Quan to withdraw. (However, according to Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, it was Tian Yu who offered this advice, not Liu Shao.)

  "text" : "Leo Landreville (February 23, 1910 – 1996) was a Canadian politician and lawyer, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario in 1955 and 1956  before being appointed to the Supreme Court of Ontario as a judge. He later became the first Ontario Supreme Court justice ever to be removed from the bench, after being implicated in the Northern Ontario Natural Gas scandal. Landreville, a native of Ottawa, practiced law in Sudbury in the 1940s and 1950s before becoming the city's mayor. During his mayoral term, he was offered an option on 10,000 shares of stock in Northern Ontario Natural Gas, a company run by Ralph K. Farris that was seeking a municipal agreement on the construction of a natural gas pipeline through Northern Ontario. When the NONG contract was approved by city council, Farris purchased the shares at the original price offered to Landreville, sold 2,500 shares to reimburse the company, and delivered the 7,500 remaining shares to Landreville at no cost. Following his appointment to the Supreme Court, Landreville sold the shares for a profit of $117,000. After an Ontario Securities Commission investigation into NONG's stock distributions, it was ultimately revealed that many of Northern Ontario's mayors, as well as some members of Premier Leslie Frost's cabinet, had received low-cost shares. After a second investigation, Landreville was charged with municipal corruption and conspiracy, and was acquitted as there was no evidence that he had exerted any influence on Sudbury's city council to approve the NONG contract. In response, however, the Law Society of Upper Canada held a secret hearing in which it determined that despite the acquittal, Landreville's conduct had fallen below the \"standards of probity\" demanded of a judge, and called for his resignation. In 1966, Prime Minister Lester Pearson appointed a Royal Commission, chaired by Ivan Rand, to investigate the case. Controversially, the Law Society report was admitted into the proceedings, but the original judgement acquitting Landreville of misconduct was not. Landreville was also never given an opportunity, as required under law, to respond to the royal commission's report. Landreville initially refused to resign from the bench, leading Pearson's government to announce, on June 6, 1967, an unusual joint address of the House of Commons and the Senate to have him removed from the bench. He was then convinced to resign voluntarily with the promise of a partial pension. Pierre Trudeau, then Justice Minister, later wrote to advise Landreville that the federal cabinet had decided not to offer Landreville the pension, although subsequent Access to Information requests revealed that the cabinet had made no such decision. Landreville waged a ten-year legal battle to have the pension offer honoured, and was finally offered $250,000. Landreville subsequently returned to practicing law."

At the 1931 general election, Mallalieu was elected as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley. His win was notable as it was a gain from Labour despite the presence of a Conservative candidate, unusual for 1931. His predecessor was the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, who had decided to stand down. His father Frederick Mallalieu had been MP for the same seat from 1916 to 1922. Mallalieu was a member of the main Liberal group in parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel. He followed his leader into opposition in 1933. He served until the 1935 general election, when he lost his seat to Labour's Ernest Marklew. After joining the Labour Party, he returned to the House of Commons in 1948, at a by-election on 24 March in the Brigg constituency, where he served as MP until he retired in 1974. He was a Deputy Speaker of the Commons from 1971 to 1974."

Bond was born to Jonas and Elizabeth Bond. and grew up on his father's farm in Ravenna, Ohio. He received his law degree in 1853 and traveled to Chicago the following year. In 1854, he formed a legal partnership with A.S. Seaton. By 1858, he had partnered with E.A. West, a law firm which remained until 1891 when it became Bond & West. Bond was one of the founders of the Republican party in Chicago. In 1862 and 1864 he was elected a Chicago alderman. In 1867, he was elected to the Illinois General Assembly, and served until 1871. When Chicago Mayor and newspaper publisher Joseph Medill traveled to Europe in 1873, Medill named Bond acting mayor of Chicago. When Medill's term expired that same year, Bond ran as an independent on a law and order platform, supporting laws which would ban the sale of liquor on Sundays. He was defeated by Harvey Colvin, who won with 60% of the voted despite Bond receiving the endorsements of all Chicago newspapers except the Times. Bond married Mary Aspenwall and they had one daughter, Laura, who was born in 1867."

Before the election of the first federal leader of the party (the Liberal Democrats having a federal structure in their internal party organisation), the leaders of the two parties which merged to form the Liberal Democrats, the Liberal Party and the SDP, served as joint interim leaders. In the event that the leader dies, resigns or loses his or her seat in Parliament, the deputy leader serves as interim leader until a leadership election takes place. This has occurred twice, with Menzies Campbell serving as interim leader following the resignation of Charles Kennedy (Campbell was elected leader in the ensuing election) and Vince Cable serving as interim leader following Campbell's resignation."

  "text" : "Elisabeth Carolina \"Lizzy\" van Dorp (September 5, 1872, Arnhem – September 6, 1945, Banju Biru, Java) was a Dutch lawyer, economist, politician and feminist. Van Dorp studied law at Leiden University, obtaining a degree, the first woman in the Netherlands, in 1901 and a promotion in 1903. She then practiced private law, and became active in various feminist movements, although she opposed the more radical forms of feminism—her focus was on instituting female suffrage. In 1915, she was invited to join the editorial team of the Economist, a leading Dutch economics journal. In the 1920s she became swayed by the political ideas of another (orthodox) liberal, Samuel van Houten. In 1922, Van Dorp became a parliamentarian for the Liberal Party, until 1925. After that she supported the Liberal State Party. At the end of the 1930s, she became an avid traveller, with stay-overs in Switzerland and Turkey. In 1940, she could not risk going back to the Netherlands, as another economist she had heavily criticized over the years, had become a powerful force in the National Socialist Movement and was close to the German occupier. Instead she veered for the Dutch Indies, her mother's country of birth. On her 72nd birthday in 1944 she received a particular notebook. It served as a gift from other women in camp Tjihapit II in Bandoeng on West-Java. It was a collection of recipes from the Indonesian kitchen to which they added their own recipes. Van Dorp died in a Japanese internment camp on Java, three weeks after the capitulation of Japanese forces. She had been interned there for over three years."

A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he represented northeast Minneapolis districts in the Minnesota Legislature from 1981 to 2011, and served as the Senate's majority leader from 2007 to 2011. As majority leader, he was chair of the Senate Rules Committee and its subcommittees, and also served on the Senate Tax Committee. Pogemiller was born in Minneapolis and graduated from DeLaSalle High School in 1969. He was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1980, serving as the representative of District 55A from 1981 to 1983. After serving one term, he was elected to the Senate in 1982, serving the old District 58 prior to the 1992 redistricting and, thereafter, District 59. He was re-elected in every general election. He was appointed Director of the Higher Education office in October 2011 by Governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton. Pogemiller is known for his outspoken, assertive leadership style and his strategic thinking. Reporter Tom Scheck of Minnesota Public Radio called him \"a brilliant and combative political tactician who often speaks his mind\". Former Minnesota House Speaker Steve Sviggum called him \"a very frustrating individual as he runs the clock past midnight all the time.\" Pogemiller had a rocky relationship with former Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty."

  "text" : "Lucceius Albinus was the Roman Procurator of Judea from 62 until 64 AD and the governor of Mauretania from 64 until 69 AD. Appointed procurator by the Emperor Nero following the death of his predecessor, Porcius Festus, Albinus faced his first challenge while traveling from Alexandria to his new position in Judea. The Jewish High Priest Ananus ben Ananus used the opportunity created by Festus' death to convene the Sanhedrin and have James the brother of Jesus sentenced to death by stoning for violation of religious law. A delegation sent by citizens upset over the perceived breach of justice met Albinus before he reached Judea, and Albinus responded with a letter informing Ananus that it was illegal to convene the Sanhedrin without Albinus' permission and threatening to punish the priest. Ananus was deposed by Agrippa II before Albinus' arrival. Immediately upon his arrival in Jerusalem, Albinus began an effort to remove the sicarii from the region. Josephus also records that Albinus became the friend of a High Priest named Ananus due to the priest's gift-giving. The sicarii responded to Albinus's efforts by capturing an assistant to the priest Eleazar, son of Ananus, and demanding the release of ten imprisoned sicarii in exchange for the assistant. The release was arranged by Ananus. When Albinus learned that he was to be succeeded by Gessius Florus, he emptied the prisons by executing prisoners charged with more serious offenses and allowing the remaining prison population to pay for their release. Following his time in Judea, Albinus was chosen by Nero to be governor of Mauretania Caesariensis. The province of Mauretania Tingitana was added to Albinus's governor duties by the Emperor Galba. Following Galba's death, Albinus supported Otho in the year of political anarchy (69), which followed Nero's death. Following Otho's death, Albinus was rumored to have styled himself as a king using the title \"Juba\". Albinus and his wife were assassinated shortly afterwards."

Larry Campbell began his career in the army and was honorably discharged as a Sergeant First Class. Campbell served as the Republic leader from 1982-1990. Campbell is credited with engineering his party's 1990 takeover of the state legislature, which lasted 16 years. He began working as a lobbyist in 1995, immediately after the end of his legislative term. He was criticized for pre-filing a bill that benefitted a client, with whom he had signed a contract while still a legislator. In 1999, he was considered the most powerful man in Salem. He started the Oregon Victory PAC, which quickly became the biggest lobbying group in the state outside the major parties; it contributed over $750,000 to Oregon politicians in the 1990s. He drew criticism for campaigning on behalf of Republican control of the legislature during the 2007 legislative session."

  "text" : "Lucy Annie Middleton (née Cox; 9 May 1894 – 20 November 1983) was a Labour politician in the United Kingdom. In 1936, she married James Middleton, General Secretary of the Labour Party. In the 1945 landslide general election, Middleton was elected Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton, gaining the seat from the Conservatives, after the retirement of her predecessor Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor. Middleton held Plymouth Sutton until 1951, when it was gained by another member of the Astor family, Jakie Astor. Lucy Middleton was an active member of Wimbledon Labour Party when the idea of publishing a book on the contribution of women to the labour movement was put forward as a way to celebrate International Women's Year. The Labour Party agreed to publish the book, and Lucy Middleton edited the essays of the 9 younger women she had invited to contribute. When finished the Labour Party General Secretary decided there was no money to publish the book, but Croom Helm agreed to publish it as \"Women in the Labour Movement, the British experience\" in 1977."

He was the son of Laurence Dalton Robins, a farmer from Tullaghnageeragh near Moate in County Westmeath, who worked undercover for Sinn Féin under the alias \"Richard Dalton\". When the First Dáil established a separatist Irish Republic in 1919, the younger Robbins worked in the Dáil government's Department of Finance. He was nominated as a Sinn Féin candidate in the Longford–Westmeath constituency in the 1921 general election. Arthur Griffith suggested that, if elected, he be excused attendance at the Dáil in order to continue working for the Department of Finance; Michael Collins overruled Griffith. Robbins and the other Sinn Féin candidates were returned unopposed as TDs to the Second Dáil. On 7 January 1922, he voted in favour of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. On 11 January he was appointed Assistant Minister for Local Government in the post-Treaty Dáil government, although this appointment was never ratified by the Dáil. He lost his Dáil seat at the 1922 general election, although he remained an Assistant Minister until the Dáil government was merged with the Provisional Government in September."

The business was founded in Belfast in 1958, but Steinberg moved to Liverpool in 1977 when he refused to pay protection money to either republican or loyalist paramilitaries, and after he was shot on 23 February 1977 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Despite his move to England, he continued to describe himself thus: \"I am Jewish, Northern Irish, and an Ulster Unionist\" Since 2005, Stanley Leisure has seen changes of ownership, with William Hill buying the bookmaking operations and the Genting Group buying the casino operation. Steinberg sold a large number of his shares in 2004, but retained 11.3% of the company's stake. His personal fortune was estimated as being some £108 million in 2005. He was also the founder and Chairman of Trustees of the Steinberg Family Charitable Trust. Steinberg, who then lived in Hale, was made a Conservative Party life peer on 23 June 2004 with the title Baron Steinberg, of Belfast in the County of Antrim, and had made contributions to the Conservative Party. The Northern Ireland Friends of Israel group was launched with Steinberg as president in March 2009. He spoke of “the longstanding links which connect Northern Ireland and Israel” at that launch. Steinberg died in London on 2 November 2009 while travelling to attend a sitting of the House of Lords. He is survived by his wife Beryl, two children and grandchildren."

  "text" : "Larcenia J. Bullard (July 21, 1947 – March 16, 2013) was an American politician and a Democratic member of the Florida State Senate, representing the 39th District, which included parts of Collier, Hendry, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties, from 2002 to 2012. Bullard was born in Allendale, South Carolina, and moved to Florida in 1980. In 1992, she was elected to the Florida House of Representatives from the 118th District, defeating Republican candidate John Minchew. She was re-elected without opposition in 1994, and in 1996, defeated Republican William \"Bill\" Greene. Bullard sought a final term in the House in 1998, and defeated Republican James Jones and Independent Denny Wood. She did not seek another term in 2000, and was succeeded by her husband, Edward B. Bullard. In 2002, Bullard sought election to the Florida State Senate from the 39th District, and, in the Democratic primary, faced former State Representative Ronald Saunders, former State Representative John F. Cosgrove, Donald Jones, and State Representative Cindy Lerner. Bullard narrowly defeated Saunders to win her party's nomination by fewer than 800 votes, and in the general election, defeated Republican nominee Evaristo Marina in a landslide. Bullard faced a tough re-election campaign in 2004, when former State Representative Ronald Saunders, who had run two years prior, and Sheila Chamberlain, ran against her in the Democratic primary. However, Bullard defeated both Saunders and Chamberlain, moving onto the general election, where she crushed her Republican opponent, Joseph Delaney. In 2008, Bullard was unopposed for re-election and won a final term. She was unable to seek re-election in 2012, and her son, Dwight Bullard, was elected to replace her. Bullard died on March 16, 2013. She was absent from 2011 Florida Legislative Session after suffering a heart attack, returning to the Senate floor in 2012 to complete her term. She appeared on the Senate floor two weeks before her death in support of her son, Senator Dwight Bullard."

  "text" : "Len Goucher (born September 19, 1947) is a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Bedford in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2006 to 2009. He is a member of the Progressive Conservatives. A town councilor in Bedford, Nova Scotia from 1988 to 1996, Goucher was elected to Halifax Regional Council in 2000. He was re-elected in 2004 and served as Deputy Mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality. He entered provincial politics in the 2006 election, defeating Liberal leader Francis MacKenzie in the Bedford riding. In June 2006, Goucher was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Tourism, Culture and Heritage. In October 2007, Goucher was shuffled to Minister of Immigration. In January 2009, Goucher was given two additional roles in cabinet, becoming Minister of the Public Service Commission, and Minister of Seniors. In the 2009 election, Goucher was defeated by Liberal Kelly Regan. In February 2010, he became embroiled in a spending scandal involving inappropriate expenses charged to the public by a number of Nova Scotia MLAs. Goucher was singled out by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation when they highlighted Nova Scotian politicians for their \"outrageous\" expense claims, naming him the all-star of the scandal and giving him the nickname Len \"the master of multi-tasking\" Goucher. On February 14, 2011 the RCMP released its long awaited investigation results and Goucher was cleared of any wrongdoing."

  "text" : "Lemuel Allan Wilmot (31 January 1809 – 20 May 1878) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and judge. Born in Sunbury County, New Brunswick, the son of William M. Wilmot and Hannah Bliss, Wilmot was educated at the Fredericton grammar school and at King’s College. He started articling law in 1825, became an attorney in 1830, and was admitted to the bar in 1832. He was created a Queen’s Counsel in 1838. From 1834 to 1851, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and was a Reformer. Responsible government was granted in 1848 and Wilmot served as Attorney-General from 1848 to 1851. From 1851 to 1868 he was a judge but was also outspoken in his support of Canadian confederation which was achieved in 1867. He was the third Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick from 1868 to 1873. Wilmot had strong anti-Catholic and anti-French views once saying \"Lower Canada would [not] be tranquillised and restored to a proper state, till all the French distinguishing marks were utterly abolished, and the English laws, language and institutions, universally established throughout the Province.\" In 1837, James Pierce, the publisher of the paper The Gleaner and Northumberland Schediasma was arrested and jailed for printing that Wilmot had \"told an untruth\" in the House of Assembly. He was held in York County Jail for 22 days, but he was released without charge after much criticism in other papers about freedom of the press. A Methodist, he was the first non-conformist to serve as Attorney-General or as a judge in New Brunswick. He died in Fredericton in 1878."

A lawyer who retired from practice in 2001, Compton served on Kenora's municipal council from 2003 to 2006. He defeated incumbent mayor Dave Canfield in the 2006 municipal election. In early 2008, Compton rejected a buyout offer from Thunder Bay Telephone for Kenora's municipally-owned telephone service provider, citing that an agreement in principle had already been reached to sell the system to Bell Aliant. Compton announced in spring 2010 that he would not run for re-election in the 2010 municipal election. Canfield was re-elected as his successor. As mayor, Compton was instrumental in the decision to have the Ontario Provincial Police provide policing to Kenora, which resulted in the disbandment of the town police force in 2009. One of the factors in the decision was the increased focus of the OPP on traffic enforcement. Ironically, in March 2011, Compton was arrested by the OPP while driving in Kenora and charged with exceeding the alcohol limit."

He was the Progressive Conservative Member of the House of Assembly for Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans from 1979 to 1995. Since 2005, Simms has been chairman and chief executive officer of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation, a provincial crown corporation. He served as Speaker of the House of Assembly from 1979 to 1982 when he was appointed to the provincial cabinet of Premier Brian Peckford. Simms served in the portfolios of Culture, Recreation and Youth, Forest Resources and Lands, President of Treasury Board and President of Executive Council. Simms ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1989 but lost to Tom Rideout who subsequently appointed him Development Minister in his Cabinet. The Tory government was defeated in the 1989 general election and Simms moved to the Opposition benches. He succeeded Rideout in 1991 to become Leader of the Opposition and party leader. The party lost the 1993 general election and Simms resigned as party leader two years later. He was appointed head of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation by Premier Danny Williams in 2005. In 2007 he stepped down in order to take a senior role in Williams' 2007 re-election campaign and was immediately re-appointed to the $130,000 a year housing corporation position following the election leading to complaints of \"blatant patronage\" from the Opposition."

After the mulo (current-day vmbo) and a year of high school in the USA, he attended the Academy for Educational Labour in Baarn. He then started to work as a youth worker in Leiden. Ten years later Verbeek started his political career through political institutions, ending up as an alderman in Houten (1989-1996). He was appointed mayor of Purmerend. In between he was director of a self-created company. On December 18, 2007, it was announced that Verbeek was a candidate for mayor of Eindhoven along with Rob van Gijzel. A referendum was held on January 23, 2008, in which Verbeek scored 33% of the votes, but because the required number of voters was not met, the referendum was nullified and the decision was made in-house, which resulted in Rob van Gijzel being appointed mayor of Eindhoven. Verbeek was replaced by Fons Hertog as mayor of Purmerend in November 2008, as Verbeek was appointed the Queen's Commissioner for the province of Flevoland."

  "text" : "Lestock Peach Wilson DesBrisay (March 28, 1820 – December 10, 1872) was a Canadian businessman and politician in the Province of New Brunswick. DesBrisay was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the son of Lucy Wright and her husband Theophilus DesBrisay, Jr. (1789–1847), a naval officer from St. John's Island. In 1824 the family moved to Chatham, New Brunswick where Theophilus DesBrisay, Jr. served as special assistant to the customs service. A businessman, Lestock P. W. DesBrisay made his home in Richibucto and, on October 14, 1841, he married Diana Gay Smith, daughter of Dr. Rufus Smith, a former member of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for Westmorland County. DesBrisay followed in his father-in-law's footsteps and in 1856 DesBrisay was elected to the 17th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly for Kent County. He served more than ten years, being reelected in 1857 through 1865 to the 18th, 19th and 20th Legislative assemblies.

He had a column that appeared daily on the back page of the Dispatch called \"Cabbages and Kings,\" a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem, \"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\" He commonly wrote under the pen name \"Larry Ho.\" The name came about when he had written his first feature article for the Times. He was signing his name, \"Larry Hodgson,\" but his pencil broke after the first \"o.\" The city editor, James Gray, reportedly said, \"Better let it go at that–'Larry Ho.'\" He served as secretary to both St. Paul mayors Winn Powers and Vivian R. Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930. Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes. After Hodgson's death in 1937, his son, Laurence K. Hodgson, edited and published a book called \"Howdy Folks: Selections from the Writings, Verse and Speeches of Larry Ho.\""

He allied with the House's Conservative Caucus, and was known to be a Republican. He was re-elected nine times. When the Conservative Caucus gained a majority in 1963, he became Speaker by one vote over Aubrey Dirlam, and held the position until his retirement from the House in 1971, when he was succeeded by Dirlam. Duxbury was offered the position of United States Attorney for Minnesota by President Richard Nixon in 1969, but declined. After leaving the Legislature, he became a lobbyist for and vice president of Burlington Northern Railroad. Duxbury died in 2002."

He was also on Gold Coast City Council from 1985–2001, including a period as mayor 1988–1994. He was also a chancellor with the Anglican Catholic Church. On 20 March 2001, former National Party Premier and member for Surfers Paradise Rob Borbidge resigned from the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Bell contested the resulting by-election as an independent. Due to voter anger at going back to the polls for the second time in three months, the National vote collapsed to eight percent, and Bell was elected with 58 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote. He held the seat until the 2004 state election, when he finished third on the primary vote, allowing his Liberal challenger in 2001, John-Paul Langbroek, to win the seat.Mr Bell announced in late 2011 he would contest his former council seat of Division 7 in Surfers Paradise which he regained on 28 April 2012."

  "text" : "Lois Moorcroft is a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral districts of Mount Lorne from 1992 to 2000, and Copperbelt South since 2011, in the Yukon Legislative Assembly. She is a member of the Yukon New Democratic Party. She was born in Oshawa, Ontario, and grew up in Whitby, Ontario. She studied history at Trent University in Peterborough where she completed a bachelor's decree before moving to the Yukon. Prior to becoming a politician, Moorcroft served as a librarian at Yukon College's Whitehorse campus. She also served on the Yukon Employment Standards Board, the Yukon Electoral District Boundaries Commission and has held positions on the boards of the Yukon College Employees Union and the Yukon Federation of Labour. In the 1992 Yukon election, Moorcroft was successful in her attempt to enter politics in the seat of Mount Lorne. A strong feminist activist, her campaign platform was built on pay equality for women and fighting against violations of the Canadian Human Rights Act. After a term in government, Moorcroft sought reelection in the 1996 Yukon election, gaining 33.2% of the votes, compared with Liberal Party candidate Ken Taylor, with 20.5%. During her second term, Moorcroft managed to obtain the positions of Minister for Justice, Education and the Women's Directorate. In the 2000 Yukon provincial election, Moorcroft again contested the seat of Mount Lorne but lost it to Liberal Party candidate Cynthia Tucker, 36% to 27%. Tucker served for one term in Mount Lorne until she was replaced in 2002 by Steve Cardiff. She continues to advocate for women and First Nations rights. In April 2006 Moorcroft was appointed to the Yukon Human Rights Commission. In June 2011 she announced that she was running as the NDP candidate in the Copperbelt South riding in the 2011 election. She won on election night by a margin of just three votes over Yukon Party candidate Valerie Boxall; her victory was confirmed in a recount."

  "text" : "Lucien Millevoye (1 August 1850 – 25 March 1918) was a French journalist and right-wing politician, now best known for his relationship with the Irish revolutionary and muse of W.B. Yeats, Maud Gonne. Millevoye was born in Grenoble in 1850, the grandson of the poet Charles Hubert Millevoye. He was the editor of La Patrie and a supporter of General Boulanger. He served as Boulangist member for the Amiens in the French Chamber of Deputies from 1889 to 1893. He was elected a Nationalist deputy from Paris in 1898 and 1902. In the late 1880s he went to Russia to further the cause of a Franco-Russian alliance. He claimed to be Boulanger's emissary to the Czar in St Petersburg, a claim Boulanger himself apparently denied. During the late 1880s and throughout the 1890s, following his separation from his wife Adrienne, he had a relationship with the Irish activist Maud Gonne which produced two children, Georges Silvère (1890–1891) who died of meningitis, and Iseult Lucille Germaine (1894–1954). Gonne was deeply involved in the Irish independence movement, editing the French language nationalist newspaper L'Irlande Libre in the run-up to the centennial of the 1798 Rebellion. Gonne left Millevoye in the summer of 1900 and returned to Ireland with Iseult. From 1898 until his death in 1918 Millevoye served as the deputy for Paris, where he died on 25 March 1918."

Born in Hubbards, Nova Scotia, he moved west during one of the British Columbia gold rushes where he and his brother, Walter Tyrrel Shatford, ran a general store in the gold mining town of Fairview near what is now Oliver. They also owned the Shatford Mercantile Store in Hedley which was one of the town's first permanent structures. In 1905, the brothers established the Southern Okanagan Land Company. They proceeded to purchase and subdivide land north of the Canada/US border and installed in irrigation system in the area of Vaseux Lake. In 1918, they sold 22,000 acres (89 km2) to the government of British Columbia for $300,000 in order to settle demobilized Canadian soldiers following World War I. Shatford was elected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in the 1903 provincial election as a Conservative representing the riding of Similkameen. He remained in the legislature until 1917 when he was appointed to the Canadian Senate by Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. He died in office in 1920. He was the second president of the BC and Yukon Chamber of Mines, founded in 1912. The first president was Robert Hedley. Shatford was elected at the organization's first annual general meeting in 1913. The Shatford School, now part of Penticton Secondary School in Penticton, British Columbia was named in his honour."

He is a member of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) party in the Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition. Lim was first elected to Parliament in the 2008 election winning the seat of Segambut from the governing Barisan Nasional coalition. Segambut had previously been considered as a Barisan Nasional stronghold. The election saw urban Chinese and Indian voters swarm to the DAP and its coalition allies; however, given the large minority of Malay voters in Segambut, Lim's victory was also attributable to a sizeable number of Muslim Malays in the constituency backing the DAP, a secular party with few Malay members or politicians. In the 2013 election he increased his margin from 7,732 votes to 19,199. Lim is a Christian and a lawyer."

Datuk Seri Panglima Haji Lajim Ukin (born 15 June 1955) is a Malaysian politician and the leader of the opposition in the Sabah State Legislative Assembly. He was the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Beaufort constituency in Sabah from 2008 to 2013, and a Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government in the federal Barisan Nasional coalition government, from 2009 until his departure from the coalition in 2012. Ukin was elected to Parliament in the 2008 election, as a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in the seat of Beaufort. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Minister for Transport, moving to the portfolio of Housing and Local Government in 2009. In July 2012 he renounced his official positions in UMNO to align himself with the Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition. This resulted in the revocation of his appointment as a deputy minister. He recontested his parliamentary seat in the 2013 election on a People's Justice Party (PKR) ticket, but was defeated. While losing his federal seat, he won election to the Sabah State Legislative Assembly. He became the leader of the opposition in the State Assembly. On 2 October 2016, Ukin resigned from PKR along with two other Pakatan Harapan assemblymen. He has stated his intention to form a new Sabah-based party, and ally with the former Sabah UMNO leader, Shafie Apdal. Before entering federal politics, Ukin was prominent in Sabah state politics. He was a member of the United Sabah Party (PBS) before defecting to UMNO in 1994. He later served as Deputy Chief Minister in the Sabah government."

He then represented the Avon electorate from 1884 to 1887, when he again resigned. He bought Ilam homestead, once the largest residential building in Christchurch, and was for some years co-owner of Risingholme, which was bought from the estate of William Reeves. Harper left New Zealand in July 1891. It only emerged later that his law firm was bankrupt, and that NZ£200,000 had been embezzled. He later lived on Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, where he died in 1915. Arthur Paul Harper was his son."

  "text" : "Alan Robert Lindsay \"Lin\" Gordon (19 January 1917 – 16 June 2011) was an Australian politician. He was the Labor member for Murrumbidgee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1984. He was Minister for Conservation and Water Resources from 1976 to 1981 (with Conservation replaced by Lands and Forests in 1980), Minister for Local Government and Lands from 1981 to 1984, and Minister for Lands and Ports for a few months in 1984. Gordon was born in Cessnock to baker David Irvine Gordon and Mary Mildred Cleary. He was educated at government schools in Cessnock and after graduating was apprenticed to a pharmacy. He attended the University of Sydney, graduating in 1945. On 6 November 1943 he married Valerie Merle Webber, with whom he had five children. He subsequently owned a pharmacy, and also a trotting stud near Leeton. A Roman Catholic, he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1962. In 1965, he was elected to Leeton Shire Council, where he served until 1970 (including a year as President, 1969–1970). When Al Grassby, Labor member for Murrumbidgee, resigned in 1969 to contest the federal seat of Riverina, Gordon was selected as the Labor candidate for the resulting by-election, which took place early in 1970. He easily defeated his Liberal and Country Party opponents. In 1976, he was appointed to the ministry, holding the Conservation and Water Resources portfolios. He briefly served as Acting Minister for Health in 1977, for Local Government in 1978 and for Corrective Services in 1979. In 1980 the Conservation portfolio was split into Lands and Forests, both of which were retained by Gordon. In 1981 his Forests and Water Resources portfolios were exchanged for Local Government, which in turn was exchanged for Ports in 1984. Gordon retired in 1984; his seat was won by National Party candidate Adrian Cruickshank in his absence. Gordon died at his Wagga Wagga home on 16 June 2011."

  "text" : "Lloyd Mandeno OBE (3 October 1888 – 30 December 1973) was a New Zealand electrical engineer, inventor and local politician. He was born in Rangiaowhia, Waikato, New Zealand, on 3 October 1888. One of his notable accomplishments was the invention and widespread use of \"single wire earth-return\" (SWER) grids for rural electrification in New Zealand. This form of grid uses only a single wire, and made rural electrification dramatically more affordable and commonplace. It improves the standard of living of rural families. SWER is now used in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Brazil and some parts of the United States. In New Zealand, SWER is sometimes called \"Mandeno's clothesline.\" In a history of WEL Networks, Mandeno, who was Chief Electrical Engineer at Frankton Power Station from 1913 to 1916, was described as having a distinguished career designing and building hydro power stations. In the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours, Mandeno was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to engineering."

He farmed and worked as an office worker before entering politics. In 1961, he married Doris Samuels. Kopelchuk served in the Saskatchewan cabinet as Minister of Parks and Renewable Resources and as Minister of Northern Affairs. He was defeated by Darrel Cunningham when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1991. As part of an investigation into fraudulent use of communications allowances by Progressive Conservative members of the Saskatchewan legislature, Kopelchuk was charged with using a false expense claim to pay $1,568 for an electronic public address system. This expense could have legitimately been claimed against his constituency office allowance. In addition, the actual cost of the system was $1,005; the balance went to John Scraba, communications director for the Saskatchewan Progressive Conservative party. The judge acquitted him, deciding that there was no evidence that Kopelchuk was aware of the misleading invoice. As of 2010, Kopelchuk was living in Canora."

She became known for the \"Luise Ermisch Method\" (\"Luise-Ermisch-Methode\"), an approach to industrial production involving detailed planning that subdivided the manufacturing process into individual work station segments and allowed for quantity and quality of output to be precisely measured, evaluated, bench-marked and attributed. The resulting statistical output could be used to feed a system of incentives and rewards. Because East Germany operated with a centrally directed economy, it was possible to disseminate the \"Luise Ermisch Method\" relatively easily."

Following his defeat, he returned to the education field, and served as one of the two directors of schools for the SouthwestRegional School Board. In June 2000, the Government of Nova Scotia divided the Southwest Regional School Board into two district boards, and Legere was named the chief executive officer for both the new Tri-County District School Board and the new South Shore District School Board. He also served as Regional Education Officer for the Nova Scotia Department of Education. In April 2013, Legere was appointed to the federal government's Social Security Tribunal, which handles all EI, Social Security and Canada Pension Plan appeals."
