  "text" : "Henry Laurens (March 6, 1724 [O.S. February 24, 1723] – December 8, 1792) was an American merchant and rice planter from South Carolina who became a political leader during the Revolutionary War. A delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Laurens succeeded John Hancock as President of the Congress. He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and President of the Continental Congress when the Articles were passed on November 15, 1777. Laurens had earned great wealth as a partner in the largest slave-trading house in North America (Austin and Laurens). In the 1750s alone, this Charleston firm oversaw the sale of more than 8,000 enslaved Africans. He was for a time Vice-President of South Carolina and a diplomat to the Netherlands during the Revolutionary War. He was captured at sea and imprisoned for some time by the British in the Tower of London. His son John Laurens, a colonel in the Continental Army and officer on Washington's staff, believed that Americans could not fight for their own freedom while holding slaves. In 1779, he persuaded the Continental Congress to authorize the recruitment of a brigade (3000 men) of slaves, who would be given their freedom after the war. However, when he presented it to them, the South Carolina Provincial Congress overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, and instead voted to use confiscated slaves as payment to recruit more white soldiers. John Laurens was killed in a skirmish in South Carolina in 1782."

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor."

  "text" : "Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd (8 September 1901 – 6 September 1966), also known as Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, was a South African Psychology and Philosophy scholar, Afrikaans newspaper editor-in-chief and Prime Minister of South Africa. He is regarded as the mastermind behind socially engineering and implementing the racial policies of apartheid, the system of legal racial classification and forced racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Verwoerd rigidly enforced Apartheid policies through further introducing oppressive laws, which diminished the rights of ordinary individuals especially black South Africans. Verwoerd empowered the police, Secret Police and Army to extraordinary levels. During his time in office he ordered a secret all-out offensive against those opposed to apartheid policies and as a result tens of thousands people were arrested, jailed and or sent into exile. People were also tortured and killed (Sharpeville massacre) during his time in office. Verwoerd was a right wing authoritarian leader and Afrikaner nationalist. He was a strong advocate of the Afrikaner volk, language, culture and Christian religion. He held that white control over South Africa could only continue if the races lived apart. He survived an assassination attempt in 1960, succumbing to a subsequent one in 1966. Prior to entering politics, Verwoerd was regarded as a brilliant social science professor at Stellenbosch University. He completed his undergraduate studies with distinctions majoring in sociology, psychology and philosophy. Verwoerd continued his studies completing his master's (cum laude) and doctorate in social psychology and philosophy. As a result of his academic performance, Verwoerd received a post-doctoral scholarship from the University of Oxford, but turned it down and continued his research in the fields of sociology and philosophy at various German universities. Upon his return to South Africa, he was appointed professor of Applied Psychology at Stellenbosch University at the age of 26. He was then later appointed as head of the sociology department in 1933. Verwoerd was prime minister during the establishment of the Republic of South Africa in 1961, thereby fulfilling the Afrikaner dream of an independent republic for South Africans. During his tenure as prime minister, anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) were banned, and the Rivonia Trial, which prosecuted ANC leaders, was held. His term ended with his assassination on 6 September 1966 by Dimitri Tsafendas. Many major roads, places and facilities in cities and towns of South Africa were named after Verwoerd; in post-apartheid South Africa, most of these references to the creator of apartheid have been renamed. Famous examples include H. F. Verwoerd Airport in Port Elizabeth, renamed Port Elizabeth Airport, the Verwoerd Dam in the Free State, now the Gariep Dam, H. F. Verwoerd Academic Hospital in Pretoria, now Steve Biko Hospital, and the town of Verwoerdburg, now Centurion."

  "text" : "Sir Hugh Hoyles (born October 17, 1814) was a politician and lawyer who served as the third premier of the Newfoundland Colony. Hoyles was the first premier of Newfoundland to have been born in the colony, and served from 1861 to 1865. Born in St. John's, he was the son of Newman Hoyles, the first leader of the Tory Party. Educated in Nova Scotia Hoyles trained as a lawyer and returned to St John's in 1842, quickly establishing a large and lucrative legal practice. He was eminent in the Natives' Society and the Newfoundland Church Society. Hoyles was elected to the Assembly in 1848. He rapidly became the Conservative leader, opposing responsible government, on the grounds that the colony was not ready for it, and throwing his weight behind Bishop Feild's campaign to divide the Protestant educational grant and put Anglicans on the same footing as Catholics. This proposal alienated Methodists who thereupon voted for the Catholic Liberal Party so that, in the 1855 election, the first after responsible government, Hoyles found himself leader of the Opposition. Even though he dropped his support for Feild, and adopted a more pan-Protestant stance, he still unsuccessful in the election of 1859. In 1861, his chance came when he was hired as a lawyer by senior judges to fight Premier John Kent's plans to reduce their salaries. When Kent accused the judges, the governor and the Conservatives of conspiracy the Governor fired Kent and appointed Hoyles as the new Premier. Hoyles' government was defeated in the legislature and had to fight an election in a highly charged sectarian atmosphere which resulted in riots when the Conservatives won the election. During his term as premier, he tried to cool down sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants by inviting Catholics to join his administration and distributing all patronage fairly between religious groups. He also sent delegates to the Canadian Confederation Conference at Quebec in 1864. Newfoundland had not been invited to Charlottetown. Those delegates, Ambrose Shea for the opposition, and Frederick Carter, for the government, did not have the power to negotiate. Hoyles decided to leave office in 1865, before the crucial 1869 election which decided the fate of Confederation with Canada. He was succeeded by Sir Frederick Carter. Hoyles was appointed Chief Justice of Newfoundland, a post which he filled with great distinction. He retired to Halifax in 1880 to live with his married daughter. He died on February 1, 1888. D.W. Prowse, the nineteenth century Newfoundland historian, comments that \"we are all proud of Sir Hugh as the most distinguished Newfoundlander of our day\"."

  "text" : "Herb Dickieson (born March 8, 1954) is a physician and a former educator and politician in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Dickieson is notably the first and currently the only member of the New Democratic Party to have sat in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. Dickieson was raised in New Glasgow on a small family farm. He graduated from the University of Prince Edward Island with his B.Sc. in 1979 and received a B.Ed. in 1982. Dickieson taught high school in Calgary, Alberta for one year before entering medical school at Dalhousie University, from which he graduated with his medical degree in 1987. Dickieson interned in New Brunswick and in Prince Edward Island and established a family medicine practise in O'Leary. Dickieson was elected leader of the Island New Democrats in March 1995, and led the party in the 1996 and 2000 provincial elections, seeking to be a Member of the Legislature for District 25, West Point-Bloomfield. He was successful in the 1996 election, but was defeated in the 2000 election. Dickieson led the party through the 1990s, but resigned two years after his personal electoral defeat. Dickieson was a popular politician during his term, even among non-New Democrats, as a voice for change. He was pressured by many members to run for the federal New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election and again provincially, he had refused until he announced on September 12, 2014 that he would seek the NDP nomination for Egmont for the 2015 federal election. Dickieson was nominated as the candidate in October 2014. On October 19, 2015, Dickieson was defeated in the election, finishing third behind the winner, Liberal Bobby Morrissey and Conservative incumbent Gail Shea. Dickieson was always involved in local and provincial issues, including concern over the closing of rural post offices, the fate of farmers, and the quality of education, particularly among children. He has served on boards for the promotion of a community youth centre, as a Chamber of Commerce board of directors, and as Chief of Medical Staff at the Community Hospital. He is also currently the Past President of the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island. He resides with his wife Kathleen and family in Howlan."

He was Germany's Minister of Finance between 1999 and 2005.Eichel was chairman of the G7 in 1999 and chairman of the G20 in 2004. Before that, Eichel served as the 6th Minister President of Hesse from 1991 to 1999 and as the 52nd President of the Bundesrat in 1998/99. During his time in office, Eichel played a very important role in two landmark reforms - the far reaching reform of German society and economy (also known as Agenda 2010) and the creation of the G-20 to reflect the rebalancing of world power. Agenda 2010 helped turn Germany from the 'sick man of Europe' into the best performing major Western economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It is widely regarded as the most successful economic reforms in Germany in over half a century, and the most successful economic reforms in any G7 country in 30 years. As chairman of the G7, Eichel initiated the creation of the G20 together with then US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and hosted its inaugural meeting in Berlin. The G20 rapidly grew to become the most influential economic body in the world. Eichel went on to serve as chairman of the G20 in 2004, when he pressed for the reforming of the international financial architecture and establishing a code of conduct on preventing financial crises. Eichel currently leads the expert group on sustainable structural development for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the world's oldest and largest foundation to promote democracy and political education."

  "text" : "Edward Hugh John Neale Dalton, Baron Dalton PC (16 August 1887 – 13 February 1962) was a British Labour Party economist and politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1945 to 1947. He shaped Labour Party foreign-policy in the 1930s, opposed pacifism, promoted rearmament against the German threat, and strongly opposed the appeasement policy of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938. He served in Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet. As Chancellor, he pushed his cheap money policy too hard, and mishandled the sterling crisis of 1947. Dalton's political position was already in jeopardy in 1947, when, he, seemingly inadvertently, revealed a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted his resignation, but he later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions. His biographer Ben Pimlott characterised Dalton as peevish, irascible, given to poor judgment and lacking administrative talent. He also recognised that Dalton was a genuine radical and an inspired politician; a man, to quote his old friend and critic John Freeman, 'of feeling, humanity, and unshakeable loyalty to people which matched his talent.'"

  "text" : "Harry Flood Byrd, Sr. (June 10, 1887 – October 20, 1966) of Berryville in Clarke County, Virginia, was an American newspaper publisher, and political leader of the Democratic Party in Virginia. He was the leader of the \"conservative coalition\" in the United States Senate, which largely blocked most liberal legislation after 1937. He was a descendant of one of the First Families of Virginia. His ancestors included William Byrd II of Westover Plantation, who established Richmond, Robert \"King\" Carter of Corotoman, a colonial governor, and Pocahontas, and he was the brother of famed aviator Richard E. Byrd. His son Harry F. Byrd, Jr. succeeded him as U.S. Senator. Byrd was a dominant figure in Virginia who reorganized and modernized Virginia's government. His political machine dominated Virginia Democratic Party politics for much of the first half of the 20th century. He was elected the 50th Governor of Virginia in 1925 and continued to lead a political faction that became known as the Byrd Organization as he represented Virginia as a United States Senator from 1933 until 1965. Financial conditions in Virginia during his youth conditioned his thinking on fiscal matters throughout his life. He is best remembered for his austere \"pay-as-you-go\" financial policies. Byrd was also known as a racist and avowed white separatist. Byrd was vehemently opposed to racial desegregation of the public schools, and as such advocated a policy of \"massive resistance\" that led to closure of some public school systems in Virginia between 1959 and 1964. This policy created a large subset of black students who were denied their education in several Virginia counties. These students, many of whom are still alive, are known as the \"lost generation.\" Although he never decided to become a candidate for the office, Byrd received a considerable number of votes in the 1956 presidential election and 15 electoral votes in the 1960 presidential election."

  "text" : "Helen Mamayaok Maksagak, CM (April 15, 1931 – January 23, 2009) was a Canadian politician. She served as the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories (Canada) from January 16, 1995 until March 26, 1999 and as the Commissioner of Nunavut from April 1, 1999 until April 1, 2000. She is a notable Copper Inuk. Born on the land near Bernard Harbour in the Canadian Western Arctic, Maksagak was raised in Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik and the Bathurst Inlet area and eventually settled in Cambridge Bay to raise a family of six surviving children with her husband John Sr. Together they were stalwart supporters of the growing indigenous rights movement in the Canadian north. Their home was often a stopping place and site of discussions when young Inuit involved in negotiating the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or participating in Northwest Territories political life passed through the community. Maksagak was appointed as Deputy Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1992. In 1995, she was appointed as Commissioner, partially in anticipation of the pending creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999. She was the first woman and first Inuk to hold the office. In April 1999 she transferred with her office to the new Nunavut Territory and continued to provide stability to the new government in transition. She served until April 2000 as the first commissioner of the newly created territory of Nunavut and then as Assistant Commissioner of Nunavut from 2005 until her death in 2009. Helen Maksagak was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada in May, 2003. She served as a member of the Qulliit (Nunavut) Status of Women Council and as an Elder for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. Maksagak died on January 23, 2009 at the age of 77. Helen Maksagak Drive in Iqaluit is named in her memory."

  "text" : "Herbert Romulus O'Conor (November 17, 1896 – March 4, 1960) was the 51st Governor of Maryland, serving from 1939 to 1947. He also served in the United States Senate, representing Maryland from 1947 to 1953. He was a Democrat. O'Conor was born in Baltimore, Maryland to James P. A. O'Conor and Mary Ann (Galvin) O'Conor. He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O'Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O'Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia. From 1921 to 1922, O'Conor served as the assistant state's attorney for Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State's Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery."

  "text" : "Harry Whinna Nice (December 5, 1877 – February 25, 1941), a member of the United States Republican Party, was the 50th Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1935 to 1939. Harry Nice was born in Washington D.C., but was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He later attended Baltimore City College, Dickinson College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1899. He was married to Edna Viola Amos in 1905, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jr, and William, who died in childhood. Nice served as assistant to the State's Attorney in Baltimore, but later resigned to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Maryland in 1919. He lost to Democrat Albert C. Ritchie by a narrow margin. Following the defeat, Nice accepted a position in the Appeals Tax Court of Baltimore City as a judge from 1920 until 1924. In 1934, running under the campaign motto of \"Right the wrong of 1919\", Nice again challenged Ritchie and defeated him by 6,149 votes. Nice rose to become governor during the national depression, which brought great financial hardships to the state budget. To help find a solution to the situation, Nice assigned a committee to investigate ways of alleviating the debt, but was not pleased with the recommendations of raising taxes. Neither he nor the Maryland General Assembly felt it would be wise to raise taxes at such a rate. Also as governor, Nice redesigned the governors' residence at Government House, changing the architectural style from Victorian to Georgian. After losing the support of his party, Nice was defeated by Herbert R. O'Conor in 1938. He attempted to run for the U.S. Senate in 1940, but was unsuccessful and resumed his law practice in Baltimore. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery."

  "text" : "Henry Thomas Muggeridge (26 June 1864 – 25 March 1942) was a British politician. He was the father of the author and journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. Muggeridge was born the son of a Penge undertaker on 26 June 1864. When the family was abandoned by his father, Muggeridge left school and began work as an office boy in the City of London. The little money he kept for himself was spent on books, and it was his avid lunchtime reading that led to a keen interest in politics. His second job was again as an office boy for a firm of shirtmakers, where he stayed until he retired. He eventually became Company Secretary, but had turned down a directorship, as he felt it would be at odds with his political principles. In 1893, Muggeridge married Annie Booler, the daughter of a Sheffield factory foreman, and they had five sons, Malcolm being the middle child. Malcolm would later describe his father as a small bearded man with a large frame, a twinkling eye, and a rather bulbous nose. One of Malcolm's quoted memories of his father is of his visits to the Surrey Street Market, where he would set up his platform and expound his views on the need for socialism: \"Now ladies and gentlemen. It's His Majesty's Government, His Majesty's Navy, His Majesty's Stationery Office, His Majesty's this and His Majesty's that. But it's the National Debt. Why isn't that His Majesty's? We'll gladly let His Majesty have that, won't we?\" Muggeridge's early interest in politics at first led to his joining the Penge Liberals, and with them he campaigned for local improvements. By his late twenties he was a socialist, and he joined first the Fabians, then the Independent Labour Party. An excellent public speaker, he founded and became secretary of the Croydon Socialist Society in 1895, and stood for the Croydon Borough Council in Norwood in 1896 and 1897. He was not to be successful until November 1911, although Croydon had already had several Labour councillors. Muggeridge was the first President of Ruskin House, the Labour and Trade Union centre in Croydon, having been instrumental in its relocation and refounding. Muggeridge remained a Croydon councillor until 1930, at which time he also became a Justice of the Peace. He was instrumental in getting Croydon's first council houses built and campaigned for Trade Union rates of pay for all municipal employees. Although he stood for Parliament in Croydon South four times, in 1918, 1922, 1923, and 1924, Muggeridge finally became a member of parliament for Romford in 1929. He lost his seat in 1931 and returned to Croydon Council in 1933, retiring in 1940, at the age of 75. He died in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1942 and was buried in Whatlington, near Battle, East Sussex."

  "text" : "Helen Shiller (born 1947) is a former Alderman of the 46th ward in Chicago, Illinois. She served in the Chicago City Council for six four-year terms, from 1987 to 2011. Shiller was elected to the City Council on her third attempt, as Harold Washington, Chicago's first black Mayor, was re-elected to his second term, and her election as alderman helped close the Council Wars era in Chicago government. Shiller has been described as \"committed to liberal causes\" appropriate for the lakefront district she represents. Among her most significant impacts on Chicago were her advocacy for diverse, inclusive, affordable housing and helping craft Chicago's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Her commitment to fostering community development without displacement often brought Shiller into contention with some constituencies, real estate developers, and editorial boards. Shiller's oral history was collected by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Uptown resident, the late Studs Terkel, in his 2003 book, Hope Dies Last."

  "text" : "Herman Cain (born December 13, 1945) is an American author, business executive, radio host, syndicated columnist, and Tea Party activist from Georgia. He was a candidate for the 2012 U.S. Republican Party presidential nomination. Cain grew up in Georgia and graduated from Morehouse College in 1967 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. Cain pursued graduate studies at Purdue University and graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science in 1971, while also working full-time for the U.S. Department of the Navy. In 1977, he joined Pillsbury Company in Minneapolis where he later became vice president. During the 1980s, his success as a business executive at Burger King prompted Pillsbury Company to appoint him as chairman and CEO of Godfather's Pizza, in which capacity he served from 1986 to 1996. Cain was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Omaha Branch from 1989 to 1991. He was deputy chairman, from 1992 to 1994, and chairman, from 1995 to 1996, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. In 1995, Cain was appointed by Newt Gingrich to the Kemp Commission, and was a senior economic adviser to the Bob Dole presidential campaign. Cain became the CEO of the National Restaurant Association, in which he served as president and CEO from 1996 to 1999. During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Cain publicly opposed the Clinton health care plan of 1993, about which he questioned the president at a town hall meeting. Cain has served as a member of the board of directors of several companies, including Aquila, Inc., Nabisco, Whirlpool, Reader's Digest, and AGCO. In May 2011, Cain announced his presidential candidacy. By the fall, his proposed 9–9–9 tax plan and debating performances had made him the Republican front-runner and he briefly led President Obama in the polls. In November, however, his campaign struggled with allegations of sexual misconduct – all denied by Cain – and he announced its suspension on December 3. At the end of 2011, the Pew Research Center reported that, of the Republican candidates, \"Herman Cain was the most covered candidate\" during the year. On May 15, 2012, Cain endorsed Mitt Romney."

Since June 2002, Hope has been the party's sole leader following Catmando's death in a road traffic accident. Hope was the first-ever OMRLP candidate to be elected to public office, when he was elected unopposed to a seat on Ashburton Town Council in Devon in 1987. He subsequently became the Mayor of Ashburton in 1998. In 2010, Hope was elected unopposed to Fleet Town Council in Hampshire. Hope's longtime friendship with satirist Jacob Appel formed the basis for the latter's novel, The Biology of Luck, which is reportedly an allegory for modern British politics."

  "text" : "Hector McNeil PC (10 March 1907 – 11 October 1955) was a Scottish Labour politician. McNeil was educated at Woodside School and the University of Glasgow, trained as an engineer and worked as a journalist on a Scottish national newspaper. He was a member of Glasgow Town Council 1932-8. He chaired Glasgow Trades Council and stood for Parliament unsuccessfully in Galloway in 1929 and 1931, in Glasgow Kelvingrove in 1935 and in Ross and Cromarty in 1936. He was elected Member of Parliament for Greenock unopposed in a wartime by-election in 1941. Following the 1945 election, McNeil became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He was promoted to Minister of State at the Foreign Office in October 1946, de facto deputy to the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, and appointed a member of the Privy Council. Through his position at the Foreign Office, he was vice-president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 and leader of the British delegation to the Economic Commission for Europe, 1948. It was later revealed that his personal assistant and private secrerary at the time, Guy Burgess, was a Soviet agent, although McNeil never came under suspicion. He served as Secretary of State for Scotland from February 1950 until October 1951 in the government of Clement Attlee. McNeil died shortly after keeping his seat in the 1955 election."

  "text" : "Herbert Arthur Sinnott (January 7, 1871 – after 1923) was a Canadian educator, lawyer and municipal politician who served as the 18th mayor of Calgary, Alberta from 1913 to 1915. Sinnott was born in Kings County, New Brunswick on January 7, 1871 to David S., a farmer, and Frances (née Taylor) Sinnott. After attending schools in Sussex, New Brunswick, Sinnott graduated from Mount Allison University with a Bachelor of Arts and started his teaching career in Gagetown as principal of a grammar school. He later taught high school in Moncton, New Brunswick before moving west to Alberta in 1900. In 1903, he became a high school principal in Calgary, the first ever to the city. He began a career in law in 1908, articling under Thomas M. Tweedie. In 1911, he was called to the bar. Around this time, Sinnott also owned and rented out various properties in the city of Calgary as well as Lethbridge. He also served on the Calgary School Board as trustee in 1912 and 1920–22 along with chairman from 1908–11 and 1918–19. Sinnott was elected as Mayor of Calgary and served in this position from January 2, 1913 to January 2, 1915. During his time in office, oil was discovered within the city of Calgary, and it was said that the \"[whole city] quickly became oil conscious\". In January 1923, Sinnott pleaded guilty in a court to \"misappropriating clients' trust funds\" during his work as a lawyer in Calgary. During his trial, Sinnott admitted his guilt and was sentenced to seven years to be served in a Prince Albert, Saskatchewan jail. The magistrate had expressed that \"the more grievous\" crime that of the betrayal of trust of Sinnott to his clients, and that it was unfortunate that such a citizen of high of esteem, had admitted to committing the crimes. The magistrate also expressed that the punishment was decided to set a precedent and to \"deter others from doing the same thing\", along with restating that though it was hard to see \"a citizen of Mr. Sinnott's calibre\" take the sentence, it was a necessary justice. It is not known where Sinnott went after presumably leaving prison, although there have been rumours that he may have moved to Australia shortly thereafter. He married Margaret Horne, a graduate nurse and daughter of a sea captain, in 1901 and had one child with her, Margaret. His wife died in 1906. A conservative in politics, during his time in Calgary, Sinnott was a member of the Ancient Order of Foresters in Calgary as well as the Methodist church. Sinnott was widely regarded for his work in the educational field, with a 1912 biography beginning with \"The educational annals of the Northwest present few names which shine with a brighter luster of good deeds done than the one which forms [this paragraph]\"."

  "text" : "Hilbrand Pier Anne Nawijn (born August 8, 1948) is a Dutch politician of the Party for the Netherlands (PVN). He was Minister for Integration & Immigration from July 22, 2002 until May 27, 2003 and later a Member of the House of Representatives for the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF). Nawijn was born in Kampen. The son of a burgemeester (mayor), he is a descendant of Firmin Navin, a French Huguenot who had fled to Holland in 1696 to escape persecution. After graduating Emelwerda College in Emmeloord he studied law at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. Following a long career working for the Dutch Ministry of Justice he was elected in 2002 as a member of the Christen-Democratisch Appèl for the city council of Zoetermeer. Nawijn was an early supporter of the openly gay, populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn and in 2002, when Fortuyn founded the Pim Fortuyn List, Nawijn earned a place on the list. Despite the assassination of Fortuyn by an animal rights activist, which happened days before the election, the LPF emerged with a successful result, thus bringing Nawijn into the Dutch House of Representatives. He was appointed Minister for Integration and Immigration in the first Balkenende cabinet. Due to the instability of the LPF following Fortuyn's assassination, the first Balkenende cabinet lasted briefly, leading to early elections in 2003. Due to Nawijn's controversial conservative positions such as his support of the death penalty, which horrified many people in the Netherlands, he was placed at the bottom of the LPF's electoral list. This should have made it almost impossible for Nawijn to be reelected, however, the same statements which made him so unpopular to the political establishment won him a following among voters. On election day Nawijn received enough individual votes to once again enter the House of Representatives. Despite still being a member of the LPF, Nawijn often was at odds with the party. In January 2005, he left the fragmented LPF with the goal of founding his own political party which conceptually would lean closer towards the ideas of the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang. Together with one of the leaders of Vlaams Belang, Filip Dewinter, in June 2005 he announced the founding of a think tank during a controversial meeting in the former house of murdered politician Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, Pim Fortuyn's brother, called this action provocative, and \"I had expected otherwise from Nawijn.\" The influential Dutch magazine Elsevier writes: \"According to (the LPF member of parliament) Varela, it was widely known that Pim Fortuyn wanted nothing to do with Dewinter, who's party Vlaams Blok (resurrected as Vlaams Belang) had the previous year been forbidden due to racism.\" In the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, Nawijn managed, with his own new party, to gather 5 out of 39 seats in his hometown Zoetermeer. Later that year he entered the 2006 Dutch elections with a new party, the Partij voor Nederland (Party for the Netherlands), but obtained no seats. During his campaign, Nawijn voiced his support for accepting CIA black sites into the Netherlands in an interview in October 2006 in the Dutch newspaper Spits. In early 2007, Nawijn participated in the Dutch version of So You Wanna Be a Popstar?, broadcast by the Dutch commercial TV channel SBS6, granting him fulfilment of one of his dreams. He stated that \"Now that I have left national politics, I can do such things. An additional advantage is that it will keep me a bit 'in the picture'\". As a result of his performances at the talent contest, which were met with public ridicule, Nawijn signed up for a five-year contract as a singer. His first single came out in May 2007, Hey Jumpen, in the jumpstyle genre, and reached #45 in the Dutch Single Top 100 charts. In February 2008 he returned to his original career in law."

  "text" : "Hazen Stuart Pingree (August 30, 1840 – June 18, 1901) was a four-term Republican mayor of Detroit (1889–1897) and the 24th Governor of the U.S. State of Michigan (1897–1901). A Yankee who migrated from New England, he was a Georgist social reformer who battled corporations and was an early leader of the Progressive Movement. A businessman with no political experience, Pingree was elected mayor in 1889 after a colorful campaign in which Pingree revealed his tolerance by making a circuit of saloons. Pingree added to the old stock Yankee Republican base by making large inroads into the German and Canadian elements. He was reelected in 1891, 1893 and 1895. Warning repeatedly against the dangers of government by corporations, he launched nationally visible crusades against Detroit's streetcar, gas, electric, and telephone companies. He successfully forced rate reductions that won him widespread popularity. He won public approval for a citizen-owned electric light plant, and became a national spokesman for municipal ownership and close regulation of utilities and street railways. When the nationwide Panic of 1893 caused a severe depression, Pingree gained support by opening empty lots to garden farming – people called him \"Potato Patch Pingree.\" Pingree was a Republican, and had nothing to do with the Populist Party that had considerable support among labor union members. He supported the gold standard in 1896, and worked to carry Michigan for William McKinley over silverite William Jennings Bryan in the intensely competitive 1896 U.S. presidential election. Pingree was on the ballot, too, and was elected governor of Michigan. As governor, he fought a strong conservative opposition, but did succeed in forcing passage of the nation's first major statewide reappraisal of railroad and corporate property, with an eye to raising their taxes. This led to a rational basis for railroad regulation and taxation, emulated by Progressive reformers in other states and nationwide. A survey of scholars in 1999 ranked Pingree as the fourth best mayor in all of American history."

Hugh Conway was an early supporter of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond (later Henry VII), was sent by Margaret Beaufort, Henry's mother to Henry, in exile in France, in 1483 with a large sum of money and encouragement to invade England through Wales and seize the crown from Richard III. Henry did so in 1485 and Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth, where Hugh was present. Hugh was appointed Keeper of the Great Wardrobe by King Henry VII on 21 September 1485, was knighted in January 1486 at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV, and married Elizabeth Courtenay, daughter of Edward, 5th Earl of Devon, in 1490. Sir Hugh Conway was appointed Sheriff of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire by Henry VII in 1500. Sir Hugh was a son of John ‘ Aer Conwy Hen ’ of Bodrhyddan Hall and Constable of Rhuddlan Castle, Flintshire, Wales, by his first marriage, and descended from the ancient line of Conway (Conwy = Wales) and de Crevecouer (The Journal Of The Flintshire Historical Society (Appendix D: Conwy Pedigree (British Museum Harleian MS 1971))). Sir Hugh's younger half-brother was Edward Conway who married the heiress of Arrow and Alcester, Warwickshire, and was great-grandfather to Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway of Ragley Hall, ancestor of the present family of Seymour Conways, Marquis of Hertford."

  "text" : "Henry Smith Lane (February 24, 1811 – June 18, 1881) was a United States Representative, Senator, and the 13th Governor of Indiana; he was by design the shortest-serving Governor of Indiana, having made plans to resign the office should his party take control of the Indiana General Assembly and elect him to the United States Senate. He held that office for only two days, and was known for his opposition to slavery. A Whig until the party collapsed, he supported compromise with the south. He became an early leader in the Republican Party starting in 1856 serving as the president of the first party convention, delivering its keynote address, and was influential in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. With the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, he became a full-fledged abolitionist, and in the Senate he was a pro-Union advocate and a strong supporter of the war effort to end the rebellion."

He called for a recount but the following day was defeated by 150 votes. In 1997, he was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1997 general election, defeating Paddy Harte. He retired at age 74 at the 2002 general election after serving one term. He was succeeded by his son, Niall Blaney. His support for the 1997 Ahern government led to the construction of the Harry Blaney Bridge, which opened in 2009 to link the Rosguill and Fanad peninsulas across Mulroy Bay in north County Donegal.

He suggested a full-scale attack across the bridge, which cost the English the battle and led to his own demise. According to legend, his body was flayed by the Scots as he had flayed Scottish war prisoners, and William Wallace made a sword belt out of his skin. The Lanercost Chronicle states the Scots dried and cured his hide and The Scalacronica merely states that Walter of Hemingburgh recorded, In the 1995 film Braveheart he is portrayed by the actor Gerard McSorley, and dies of beheading by William Wallace, although the name in the film was 'Cheltham' and he was ordered to lead by a superior."

  "text" : "Han Tuozhou (simplified Chinese: 韩侂胄; traditional Chinese: 韓侂胄; pinyin: Hán Tuōzhòu; Wade–Giles: Han T'o-Chou) (1152–1207) was a powerful Chinese statesman of the Southern Song dynasty, chancellor to Emperor Ningzong. He was responsible for Southern Song efforts to recover territories lost in northern China to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in their 1142 peace settlement that ended the Jin–Song war. In his efforts to begin a military build-up, he had Yue Fei (who had resigned during peace talks with the Jurchen, after which he was jailed and poisoned) posthumously promoted and Qin Hui (who led the aforementioned peace talks with the Jurchen) demoted. These efforts were unsuccessful, and the ensuing war was devastating to southern China, resulting in further territorial losses and terrible inflation. In consequence, Han was executed by the Song regime, and his head offered to the Jurchens as a peace offering. Han Tuozhou is also famous for his opposition to daoxue (the Song neo-confucianist movement) which was banned on his order during the years 1195-99. His antagonizing policies were reversed by his successor in office, Shi Miyuan (史彌遠). Han was assassinated by bludgeoning in 1207,on his way to the imperial palace, he was arrested and sent under imperial guards to the garden of Yujin where he was executed. an exceptional affair in the generally tolerant political atmosphere of Song. Yuan dynasty historiographers assigned the blame of assassination on Shi Miyuan. However, such judgement is questioned. More plausibly, his extermination was ordered by Empress Yang who succeeded the deceased niece of Han Tuozhou, Empress Huo (d.1200) Han's and Su Shidan's (蘇師旦) bodies were exhumed and presented to Jin as compensation for the Song's aggression, in the negotiation process carried out by Wang Nan and Xu Yi. This measure was probably undertaken as compensation for the humiliation of Jin confederate Wu Xi (吳曦), whose body was hung on displays in Xingzhou (興州) and Lin'an. On some accounts, Jin provided Han with honorary burial, recognizing him as a loyal official."

  "text" : "Henry Marchmore Shaw (November 20, 1817 – February 1, 1864) was a Congressional Representative from North Carolina, as well as an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was killed in action, one of a handful of former U.S. Congressmen to perish during the conflict. Henry M. Shaw was born in Newport, Rhode Island, November 20, 1817. His parents were John Allen and Elizabeth Muchmore Shaw of Newport. His father was a silversmith with interests in the West Indies trade out of Newport. The family moved to North Carolina after his father lost ships and a good portion of his livelihood to the British in the War of 1812. It's said that his brother, Silas Gardner Shaw, took the lighthouse Keeper position at Beavertail Lighthouse (1858-1862, 1863-1869) to avoid fighting against his brother in the war. Their mother died in 1829, Silas at 6 years old was sent back to Newport to live with relatives; Henry stayed in North Carolina with his father. Henry completed preparatory studies and graduated from the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1838. He began his medical practice in Indiantown, North Carolina. He was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-third Congress (March 4, 1853–March 3, 1855). Shaw was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Thirty-fourth Congress. He was elected to the Thirty-fifth Congress (March 4, 1857–March 3, 1859) and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Thirty-sixth Congress. Henry Debated \"The Kansas Question\" in April 1858; his brother Silas would take the government job at Beavertail Lighthouse in December of that same year. He was a vocal secessionist who called for North Carolina’s secession from the Union even prior to Lincoln’s election in 1860. He signed the North Carolina Ordinance of Secession on May 21 of 1861 with a quill pen he made especially for that purpose. The pen is on display at the North Carolina Museum of History located in Raleigh. The North Carolinians had convened the day before, marking the 86th anniversary of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Shaw enlisted in the Confederate army and was appointed as a colonel. He was in command of the Confederate forces at the Battle of Roanoke Island. In January 1862, General Ambrose E. Burnside leading New England Federal forces (including many Rhode Islanders) with about sixty ships and over 13,000 men began to enter Hatteras inlet, and assembled in Pamlico Sound. On February 6, 1862 Burnside’s forces entered Roanoke Harbor. On the morning of February 8 Burnside’s forces landed on the south end of Roanoke Island and advanced towards the north. From the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site website “Coming around the turn in the road, the Union forces saw their first view of the island’s main defense – the three-gun battery. This battery, sitting astride the road, was thirty-five yards wide with a water-filled ditch eight feet wide and three feet deep guarding the front. Supporting the three guns were about 1,000 poorly armed soldiers from various regiments.” Colonel Shaw and his men put up a valiant struggle, but were eventually overwhelmed by the Federal forces which had five times the number of men. Colonel Shaw surrendered to avoid a massacre of his men. Although Roanoke was considered a small battle in the larger picture of the Civil War, it was a pivotal turning point in Northern Support for the war; prior to that the North had not had much success and public support of the war was waning. Shaw was paroled and the North Carolina Eighth reorganized in the fall of 1862. Colonel Shaw took command once again leading forces in Charleston, Wilmington, and the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia. On February 1, 1864, in the early morning hours, at Batchelder’s Creek, while assembling on the road for the expedition to New Bern, he was shot from his horse. The bullet entered his cheek and traversed his head killing him instantly. His body was recovered and interred in the cemetery at Shawboro, North Carolina; the town of Shawboro was named in his honor."

  "text" : "Heath Nelson Macquarrie (September 18, 1919 – January 2, 2002) was a Canadian politician, teacher, scholar, and writer. Macquarrie described himself as a Red Tory, using the term in the title of his autobiography Red Tory Blues. During the October Crisis of 1970, he agonized over the implementation of the War Measures Act, and was prepared to vote against it, but relented for the sake of keeping the Tory caucus united behind Robert Stanfield. Writing in retrospect, Macquarrie described his vote in favour of the Act as \"fundamentally wrong\". He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1957 federal election that brought John Diefenbaker to power. He served as a member of parliament for twenty-two consecutive years, until he was elevated to the Canadian Senate in 1979 on the advice of Joe Clark. He sat in the upper house for a further fifteen years, retiring at the mandatory age of 75 in 1994. He was publicly loyal to Clark's successor, Brian Mulroney, but privately disagreed with the government on several occasions, once saying during a caucus meeting, \"You know, a lot of people think I have a prominent nose because of my enjoyment of a certain beverage. Well, that's all nonsense. I got it that way by having to hold it so often while voting for some of Mulroney's bills.\" Macquarrie remained active following his retirement from the Senate in 1994, by contributing a column to the Hill Times and to newspapers in his home province of Prince Edward Island. Macquarrie was educated at Prince of Wales College, the University of Manitoba, the University of New Brunswick and McGill University. He studied for his doctorate at McGill, choosing for his thesis topic Robert Borden. He lectured at Brandon University and at Mount Allison University, in economics, political science and international relations. He edited and wrote the introduction to the published edition of Sir Robert Borden's diaries. An admirer of the World War I-era prime minister, Macquarrie considered Borden to be the architect of Canadian independence."

  "text" : "Harold Willis Handley (November 27, 1909 – August 30, 1972) was the 40th Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1957 to 1961. A veteran of World War II, and furniture salesman by trade, Handley began his political career as a state senator. Thanks to his longtime friendship with state party leader and United States Senator William E. Jenner, he was able to secure the nomination to run for lieutenant governor in 1952, during which time he opposed many of the actions of Governor George N. Craig. His popularity rose among the conservative leadership of the Indiana Republican Party and aided him in winning the nomination and subsequent election as governor in 1956. He was elected during a period of conservative domination of the state government. He successfully implemented major parts of his party's agenda that affected the state for decades. After raising the gasoline tax 50% to balance the state budget, his opponents branded him \"High Tax Harold\", ignoring the fact that he also eliminated state property taxes. His launched an unprecedented mid-term campaign for a United States Senate seat, but ended in defeat and he finished his term as governor. He personally advocated mental health reform in Indiana and after leaving office he remained active in several charities that helped the mentally disabled, winning a Drummer Boy Award in 1970. He operated a successful public relations business in Indianapolis for several years and in 1969 served on the Constitutional Revision Committee that authored a set of major amendments to the state constitution."

His birth year is uncertain. The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography gives a range from 1854 to 1860, whereas Wilson gives 1855. He unsuccessfully contested the Western Maori electorate in the 1884 election. Of eight candidates, he came fifth with 9.7% of the vote. In the 1886 by-election, he came third out of five candidates. In the 1896 election, he defeated Ropata Te Ao, and he held the Western Maori electorate to 1911 when he was defeated by Māui Pōmare. Wilson notes him as a Reform Party supporter. Kaihau does, however, appear on a poster of the Liberal Party in 1910. The New Zealand Herald, in its 1905 election reporting, also lists him as a government supporter, i.e. a Liberal. Those newspapers that listed political affiliation for Maori candidates for the 1908 election, The Star (Christchurch) and The Tuapeka Times, also show him as a supporter of the Ward Ministry."

He was a local pioneer, farmer, seafarer, prospector and Member of Parliament for Esquimalt and Cariboo. Born in Asker, Norway in 1831, Helgesen is reckoned to be the first notable Norwegian immigrant to settle permanently in British Columbia, arriving from California to take part in the gold rush. During the 1860s he was elected to the colonial assembly . In 1878 he was elected to the provincial legislature, representing the riding of Esquimalt. He won his seat again in the general election of 1882 but was defeated in the election of 1886. He ran again in the British Columbia general election, 1890 but was again defeated, retiring from politics. With another Norwegian immigrant, Alfred Magnusson, he became successful in the development of the commercial fishery in the Queen Charlotte Islands. During the early 1900s Helgesen was employed as a fisheries Guardian for the Upper Skeena area and was instrumental in negotiating the Babine barricade agreement of 1906. He was promoted to Fisheries Overseer for the Lower Skeena area in September 1908 and retired in his eightieth year on December 31, 1910. He died in Metchosin, British Columbia in 1918 at the age of 87."

  "text" : "Hilda Pauline Watson (January 13, 1922 – July 14, 1997) was a Canadian schoolteacher and politician from the Yukon Territory. She was the first woman in Canadian history to lead a political party which was successful in having its members elected. First elected to the Yukon Territorial Council in the 1970 election to represent the district of Carmacks-Kluane, she was one of the first two councillors to be appointed to the new executive committee. This gave her ministerial responsibilities over education in the territory. Watson and her fellow executive councillor Norman Chamberlist built a voting bloc with two other non-executive councillors, which gave them effective control over virtually all council business. In 1974, Watson survived a motion of no confidence brought against her for her handling of a student strike in Pelly Crossing. Watson was reelected in the 1974 election, but the validity of her election was challenged in court by former executive councillor John Livesey on the basis of allegations that 26 ineligible voters had cast ballots in the district — a number larger than her margin of victory over Livesey. She resigned the seat and recontested it in a by-election, in which Livesey ran as her main challenger; Watson won the by-election. After the legislation authorizing the creation of the Legislative Assembly of Yukon, and the resulting establishment of political parties in the territory, was passed in 1977, Watson narrowly won the leadership of the new Progressive Conservative Party over federal Member of Parliament Erik Nielsen. She led the party to victory in the 1978 territorial election, in which she was the party's candidate in the electoral district of Kluane. However, she lost her own seat to Liberal opponent Alice McGuire, and therefore did not become government leader. She was succeeded as leader of the party and of the government by Chris Pearson."

  "text" : "Horatio Spencer Howe Wills (5 October 1811 – 17 October 1861) was an Australian pastoralist and politician. Born in Sydney, the son of a convict sent to Australia for highway robbery, Wills is notable as being involved in several events in Australian history. He was also the father of Tom Wills, Australia's first great cricketer and inventor of Australian rules football. The Argus newspaper of 12 March 1921 records the Horatio Wills family being at Burra Burra Gundagai till around 1840. Thomas Wills, Horatio's son, was born in 1836 near Gundagai, New South Wales. Wills was one of the first settlers of the Ararat district in western Victoria, Australia, at a 125,000-acre (510 km2) property named Lexington near Moyston. Wills intended to build a house on the property which was finally completed in 1845. While at Lexington he is credited as having named nearby Mount Ararat. He hired aborigines as station hands and harvesters on his property. In 1852, Wills sold Lexington and moved to Belle Vue in Geelong. Wills was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Grant on 10 January 1855; and was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Grant in November 1856, a position he held until August 1859. In 1861, Horatio moved north to Queensland, at Cullin-La-Ringo in the Nogoa region near Rockhampton. Just three weeks later, Horatio was murdered by aborigines, along with 18 others at the Cullin-la-ringo massacre, 17 October 1861; the biggest massacre of whites by Aboriginal people in Australian history."

  "text" : "Horace Evelyn Crawfurd (13 January 1881 – 14 March 1958) was a Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was a lecturer at Liverpool University. In 1913 he was adopted as Liberal candidate for Southport for a General Election expected to take place in 1914 or 1915. However, the election was postponed due to the war. He became a Flight Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Services and was stationed in the Far East. He continued to nurse the Southport constituency while on leave in anticipation of being candidate when the election finally came. However, the Conservative MP for Southport, received endorsement from the Coalition Prime Minister Lloyd George, so the Southport Liberals decided not to run a candidate against him. He unsuccessfully contested the Walthamstow West constituency at the general elections in 1922 and 1923, before winning the seat at the 1924 general election, narrowly defeating the Labour MP Valentine McEntee. During the 1924-29 parliament which was dominated by a Unionist majority, Crawfurd worked closely with a group of radical Liberal MPs that included William Wedgwood Benn, Percy Harris, Joseph Kenworthy and Frank Briant to provide opposition to the government. However, McEntee regained the seat at the 1929 general election. He stood again at the Islington East by-election in February 1931, where he finished fourth. His last candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was placed third of the three candidates in Leicester West. In 1930, Elinor Glyn Ltd employed Crawfurd to undertake the publicity campaign for two movies: Knowing Men (1930), which experimented with a new colour process, and The Price of Things (1931). Crawfurd also worked with the author Elinor Glyn on her own personal publicity."

  "text" : "(For other people named Howard Johnston, see Howard Johnston (disambiguation).) Howard Earl Johnston (13 June 1928 – 5 June 2001) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons. Johnston was born in Enderby, British Columbia and grew up on a farm in the Okanagan Valley. He studied English and History at university and became a high school teacher. He joined the British Columbia Social Credit Party prior to its breakthrough in the 1952 provincial election and remained involved with the party. He was approached to run for it in the 1960s. He was first elected in 1965 under the Social Credit Party of Canada in the Okanagan—Revelstoke electoral district, serving in the 27th Canadian Parliament. Following riding boundary changes, he was defeated in the 1968 federal election in the Okanagan—Kootenay riding. He made another unsuccessful attempt to gain the riding in the 1972 federal election, this time switching to the Progressive Conservative Party. In the 1974 federal election, he won Okanagan—Kootenay and served one term as a Progressive Conservative in the 30th Canadian Parliament before retiring at the 1979 federal election. Johnston took up painting after retiring from politics."

  "text" : "Sir Henry Fildes (12 May 1870 – 12 July 1948) was a Liberal Party, later National Liberal Party) and later still Liberal National Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1920 to 1923 and from 1935 to 1945. He was elected as Coalition Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Stockport at a by-election in March 1920, following the death of one of the constituency's two MPs and the resignation of the other. He was re-elected in 1922 as a National Liberal (as the Coalition Liberals became following the dissolution of the Coalition), but was defeated at the 1923 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Charles Royle. He did not contest the 1924 election, and came third in a closely fought 3-way contest at the 1925 by-election. He was unsuccessful again in 1929, and did not stand in 1931. After the death in July 1935 of Joseph Hunter, the Liberal National MP for Dumfriesshire, Fildes contested the by-election in September, winning the seat with a large majority over his only opponent, the Labour Co-operative candidate. Only a month after the by-election, Parliament was dissolved for the 1935 general election, when Fildes was re-elected by a large majority. He stood down from Parliament at the 1945 general election. He was knighted in 1932."

The constituency was then abolished and in 1950 Usborne was elected in the marginal constituency of Birmingham Yardley. He held the seat until the 1959 general election. According to his obituary in the Times on 19 March 1996, Usborne resigned from the Labour Party in 1962 and joined the Liberals. He urged former colleagues to join Jo Grimond's party as the best hope for defeating the Conservatives. There was a suggestion that Usborne be nominated to stand for the Liberal Party at Cheltenham but he announced that wild horses would not drag him into another Parliamentary contest. In addition to his work as a constituency MP Henry Usborne was one of the main drivers in the British branch of the World Federalist Movement. In 1947, ahead of the foundation of the United Nations, he co-founded the Parliamentary Group for World Government, which as All Party Parliamentary Group for World Governance (APPGWG) counts today (2008) 167 members and meets regularly to provide a forum for debate on global governance issues in the UK Parliament. In 1951 Henry Usborne set up the One World Trust as an independent educational Charity to provide secretarial support to the Group, promote and disseminate knowledge on world governance. In addition to its ongoing support for the APPGWG the One World Trust conducts independent research into the accountability of global organisations, political engagement of citizens at global level, and international law. He died in Evesham aged 86."

Lainson was a longtime party member and stood as a Social Credit candidate during the 1962 federal election in the riding of St. John—Albert, New Brunswick. He led the Ontario Social Credit Party during the 1967 general election and was its candidate in Kitchener. He won the party's June 1986 leadership convention defeating Keegstra by a margin of 67 vote to 38. Lainson hoped to rename the party Christian Freedom since he thought people mistook the name \"social credit\" for socialist and rebuild the party with the support of Christian fundamentalists He faced resistance from the onset of his leadership with Keegstra's supporters insisting that Lainson was part of a conspiracy and pledging to obstruct him. \"We're going to stonewall this guy. There's no way we're going to do business with him. As far as we're concerned, this bunch is part of the conspiracy,\" said one Keegstra supporter. and was temporarily deposed as party leader in 1987 in favour of Keegstra. Refusing to resign, Lainson's leadership was reconfirmed at a party convention later in 1987 and he succeeded in expelling Keegstra from the party. Lainson led the party through the 1988 federal election in which the depleted party ran only nine candidates and received only 3,407 votes, in what would be its final and worst ever performance in a general election. Lainson did not contest a parliamentary seat. He resigned as party leader in 1990 for unspecified \"personal reasons\" and was succeeded by another evangelical minister, Ken Campbell. In his business life, Lainson operated a computer services company for Christian charities in Ottawa."

He served as a Republican in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1905 until 1906, and in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1913 until 1924. During his time as a senator, he gained national recognition for writing the Huber Law, which allowed county prisoners to be employed during the day and launched the concept of the prison work release program; he is also known for introducing landmark unemployment legislation. He later served four terms as the 25th Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin, from 1925 until 1933, under four different governors."

  "text" : "James Henry \"Harry\" Bloy (born April 19, 1946 in Sudbury, Ontario) is a former BC Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly, in the province of British Columbia, Canada. He started representing the riding of Burquitlam after the 2001 election then represented the riding of Burnaby-Lougheed from 2009 to 2013. Bloy was the only member of the Liberal caucus to support Christy Clark in her successful 2011 leadership bid. When Clark become premier in March 2011, Bloy was appointed to his first cabinet position as Minister of Social Development. Bloy received criticism in this role and was demoted to a more junior position as Minister of State for Multiculturalism 6 months later. During this appointment, Liberal party members and public servants began work on what resulted in the 2013 Quick Wins ethnic outreach scandal. Bloy announced his resignation from cabinet in March 2012 after admitting he leaked, to a private company, an email the government had received from a newspaper. It was subsequently revealed that Bloy would not run for re-election in the 2013 provincial election."

  "text" : "Hasan Mushaima (Arabic: حسن مشيمع‎‎) is an opposition leader in Bahrain and the secretary-general of the Haq Movement, an important opposition party in Bahrain. He is campaigning for more democratic rights in Bahrain. Before forming Haq, he was a founding member of Al Wefaq and a leading figure in the 1994 uprising in Bahrain. The Bahraini government has placed Mushaima under arrest several times, twice arresting him during the 1994 uprising. He was later jailed from March 1995 to September 1995 and again from January 1996 till February 2001. Mushaima was re-arrested in February 2007 and jailed for one day, and then was arrested and imprisoned again from January 2009 to April 2009. In 2010 Mushaima traveled to Great Britain to be treated for lung cancer. Mushaima announced plans to return to Bahrain during the protests in February 2011, but authorities detained him in Lebanon while en route, possibly at the request of the Bahraini government. Mushaima finally did return to Bahrain on Saturday, February 26, 2011. On that day, he was described by theAssociated Press as being \"welcomed like a rock star,\" by protestors in Pearl Square. On 7thMarch, 2011, Mushaima along with Abdulwahab Hussain, the leader of Wafa movement, and Saeed Alshehabi, the leader of the Bahrain Freedom Movement, formed the \"Alliance for the Republic\" (Arabic:التحالف من أجل الجمهورية), because of their belief that the Bahraini regime lost legitimacy after the harsh crackdown on protesters using heavy weapons. One month after protests, the Gulf Cooperation Council sent 1,500+ PSF troops (1,000 Saudi, some Qatari troops and 500 Emirati policemen) to crush the popular uprising there and also sent the Kuwaiti Navy to stop any aid to the protesters by sea. After the protesters were kicked from the Pearl Roundabout, many known rights activists operating in Bahrain were arrested, including Mushaima. On 22 June 2011, Mushaima was sentenced to life imprisonment by a military court for \"attempting to overthrow the monarchy\". On 30 April 2012, a Bahraini court ordered a civilian retrial of Mushaima and 20 other men convicted of leading the uprising"

  "text" : "Henry J. \"Buddy\" Cianfrani (March 19, 1923 – July 3, 2002) was the Pennsylvania state senator for the first district. Prior to holding elective office, he served in the U.S. Army during World War II where he earned the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956 and 1960. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1963, where he served until his election to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1966. He eventually attained the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee from which position he worked closely with Speaker of the House Herbert Fineman to appropriate money to Philadelphia. In 1977, Cianfrani was convicted on federal charges of racketeering and mail fraud for padding his Senate payroll. His case was prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by U.S. attorney David W. Marston, who was later removed from the position by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Cianfrani was sentenced to five years in federal prison. After serving for twenty-seven months, he was released in 1980. In the middle 1970s, he began dating political reporter Laura Foreman of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The two moved in together and she reportedly accepted money and gifts from him while she was still reporting on him for her newspaper. After the affair became public in 1977 she was fired by her employer, The New York Times. She and Cianfrani married in 1980, after his divorce from his first wife was finalized and he was released from federal prison. Years after his release, his political career enjoyed a resurgence. In 1988 Cianfrani won back his old position as Philadelphia ward leader and regained a measure of clout within Philadelphia politics. He was considered a mentor to many Philadelphia politicians, including Congressman Bob Brady and Senator Vince Fumo. Cianfrani died of a stroke in Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 2002."

The son of George Hammond Whalley, Member of Parliament for Peterborough, he was born at the family estate of Plas Madoc in 1851. Educated at Brighton College and on the training ship Britannia, he afterwards entered the Royal Navy. Whalley received a lieutenant's commission in the 6th Royal Lancaster Regiment of Militia on 9 March 1871. He resigned his commission on 1 June 1872, and was commissioned a cornet in the Denbighshire Yeomanry on 29 June 1872. Whalley was promoted lieutenant, then captain on 4 December 1878. In 1879, Whalley commanded C Troop of Lonsdale's Horse, a local colonial unit, in the Anglo-Zulu War. A convoy under his command from Fort Tenedos to Fort Chelmsford successfully beat off a Zulu ambush. Whalley was elected Liberal MP for Peterborough in 1880, like his father (who had occupied the seat until his death in 1878). He resigned by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead in June 1883. He was adjudged bankrupt later that year. In April 1884, Whalley and his wife rented a house in South Kensington. They were evicted in August, after Whalley's draft for the rent had proved uncollectable, but by this time Whalley had broken into a locked room and stolen £200 of the owner's goods and pawned them. He was subsequently convicted of theft at the Old Bailey and sentenced to nine months at hard labor. He subsequently changed his surname to White, and emigrated to Queensland, with his wife and infant daughter, in 1885 or 1886. His later history is unknown."

  "text" : "Harald Ulrik Sverdrup (18 February 1813 – 23 April 1891) was a Norwegian priest and politician. He was born at Jarlsberg Manor in Vestfold. His brother Johan Sverdrup would found the Liberal Party and become Prime Minister of Norway in 1884. He graduated as cand.theol. in 1837, and worked as a senior technical officer (amanuensis) at the University Library of Oslo from 1837 to 1845. In 1845 he was appointed to a clerical position, that of chaplain in Leikanger. In 1849 the district of Balestrand was separated from Leikanger as an own parish, and Sverdrup became vicar (sogneprest) of the new parish. He published several works, mostly based on Erik Pontoppidan's explanation of the Luther's Small Catechism. As his brother, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup became involved in politics. When Balestrand became a municipality of its own in 1849, Sverdrup became its first mayor. He sat as mayor until 1879. He was among the establishers of the local savings bank in 1847, and of the transport company Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe (later: Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane) with Jan Henrik Nitter Hansen and Michael Aubert in 1858. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1851, representing the constituency of Nordre Bergenhus Amt. He was re-elected in 1854, 1857, 1859, 1862, 1865 and 1868. In 1870 he lost the election due to disagreements with Søren Jaabæk and his supporters, but Sverdrup later returned for a final term from 1874. Harald Ulrik Sverdrup stepped down as a priest in 1883. When he stepped down, his son Jakob Sverdrup stood for election, and won. He also became a government minister.A daughter of Harald Ulrik Sverdrup married the priest and Nynorsk proponent Eirik Olson Bruhjell. They had met while Sverdrup was the private tutor of Bruhjell. Another of his sons, Edvard Sverdrup, became a professor of theology. One of Edvard's sons, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup, Jr., went on to become a well-known oceanographer and metheorologist."

  "text" : "Herbert Mellor Gibson (22 February 1896 – 27 March 1954) was a member of the British co-operative movement and a Labour politician. Gibson was the youngest of five children, who was brought up in poverty after his mother was widowed. He first gained employment as an office boy at Manchester Town Hall, and worked for many years in local government. He studied economics and political history at the Co-operative College, Holyoake House. At the 1929 general election he was nominated as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for the Mossley constituency and successfully unseated the sitting MP, Austin Hopkinson. His membership of parliament was short-lived, and Hopkinson regained the seat at the next election in 1931. Gibson continued his involvement with co-operatives, becoming a director of the Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1936, at the same time leaving the employment of the local council. He subsequently held the post of chairman of the English and Scottish Joint Co-operative Society, was a director of the Manchester Ship Canal Company. He was appointed a member of the Joint Industrial Council of the Soap, Candle and Edible Fats Industries and a director of the Colonial Development Corporation."

  "text" : "Henry Twist (30 January 1870 – 16 May 1934) was a British miner's agent and Labour politician. Twist was born at Platt Bridge, near Wigan, Lancashire, and after primary education at the local Wesleyan School, began employment at Bamfurlong coal mine at the age of eleven. At the age of thirty he became a checkweighman at the mine, having also been elected to the Wigan Rural District Council. In 1906 he succeeded Sam Woods as the area's agent for the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation, and was the organisation's vice-president in 1929. He subsequently served on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. Twist was twice elected to the House of Commons as a Labour member of parliament. At the January 1910 general election he became Wigan's first Labour MP. However he was defeated at the subsequent contest in December of the same year. At the 1922 general election he was returned as member for Leigh, another Lancashire coal-mining constituency. However he was forced to retire due to ill health and did not stand at the subsequent election in 1923. Henry Twist died in Blackpool in May 1934, aged 64."

  "text" : "Herman Henry (H. H.) Kemper was an American-born farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan. He represented Gull Lake in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1934 to 1938. He was born on a farm in Hebron, Nebraska, the son of Frank Herman Kemper and Louisa Haulker. In 1906, Kemper found work with a survey crew working on the railway west of Edmonton, Alberta. He returned home later that year but, in the summer of 1907, he traveled north again and worked on a farm near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Later in 1907, he settled on a homestead south of Gull Lake. Kemper returned to Nebraska and married Mina Burwell in 1911. The couple returned to Saskatchewan later that same year. After working on a farm near Moose Jaw, they were able to purchase land not far from his original homestead. Kemper served on the rural municipal district council for Arlington. He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally."

  "text" : "Hector Morison (1850 – 4 June 1939) was a British stockbroker and Liberal Party politician. He was the son of John Morison of Glasgow, and was educated at the city's academy and university. He joined a Glasgow firm of chartered accountants and stockbrokers, but found his opportunities too limited. Accordingly, in 1879 he moved to London, and in 1886 became a member of the London Stock Exchange. In 1876 Morison had married Josephine Ashton, member of a Manchester family of textile industrialists. He built up an expertise in the textile industry, and was a principal trader in the shares of J & P Coats, the Bradford Dyers Association and the English Sewing Cotton Company. Morison was politically a man of strong Liberal views. He was elected to the Croydon School Board, and was the party's parliamentary candidate at Lewes in 1906 and at Eastbourne in January and December, 1910. In May 1912, Horatio Bottomley, the controversial Liberal MP for Hackney South, was forced to his resign his seat when he was declared bankrupt. Bottomley had been unpopular with a large portion of the party's activists in Hackney, who had run their own candidate against him in December 1910. The two Liberal factions came together to nominate Morison for the vacancy. He was comfortably elected at the by-election held on 24 May. Morison served only one term as a member of the Commons. He chose to retire at the next general election in 1918. Horatio Bottomley, whose bankruptcy had been annulled, regained the Hackney South seat as an independent. Hector Morison played no further part in public life, living in quiet retirement. He died, aged 89, at his home \"Beechcroft\", Kenley, near Croydon, in June 1939."

  "text" : "Hori Kerei Taiaroa (born 1830s or early 1840s – 4 August 1905), also known as Huriwhenua, was a Māori member of the New Zealand parliament and the Paramount Chief of the southern iwi of Ngāi Tahu. The son of Ngāi Tahu leader Te Matenga Taiaroa and Mawera Taiaroa, he was born at Otakau on the Otago Peninsula in the 1830s or early 1840s. He represented the Southern Maori electorate from 1871 to February 1879, when he appointed to the Legislative Council. He was disqualified from the Legislative Council in August 1880 over a technicality, which caused bitterness and resentment among Māori. In 1881 Ihaia Tainui who had held the electorate since 1879 resigned so that Taiaroa could resume the electorate. Taiaroa then held the electorate from 1881 to 1885 when he was again appointed to the Legislative Council, where he served for 20 years until his death. Taiaroa was active in pursuing Ngāi Tahu land claims in Parliament. Taiaroa's son John Taiaroa played all for the All Blacks in their 1884 tour of New South Wales and went on to work as a lawyer in Hastings."

After the Second World War he moved to the Dutch East Indies, where he was a civil servant from October 1945 to March 1946. He then worked for two years at the Government Information Service in Batavia. In 1948 he turned to journalism and was an assistant editor-in-chief of a newspaper for half a year. He then returned to the Netherlands to work at Dutch newspaper Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant. From 1951 to 1958 he was editor for Dutch news and from 1964 parliamentary editor. Beside his work he was chairman of JOVD, the youth section of Dutch conservative-liberal party VVD. Because of his progressive political ideas he broke away from the VVD and in 1964 he joined the social-democratic PvdA. From February 1964 Roethof worked at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, until he was elected as a PvdA MP in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands in 1969. He would remain an MP until 1989, with a break from 1982 to 1986. He was specialised in matters of law, law enforcement and media. He also worked on international law, workers' rights to strike and the legal position of civil servants."

  "text" : "Hugh Edwin Munroe, M.D., (May 31, 1878 – March 12, 1947) was the fifth Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan during the Great Depression. He was born in Glengarry County, Ontario and educated at McGill University where he earned his medical degree before undertaking post-graduate studies at the University of Edinburgh. Munroe subsequently settled in Saskatchewan where he established his medical practice. He was involved in local and provincial politics - he was defeated as a candidate for the Provincial Rights Party in the 1905 provincial election when he was a candidate in Saskatoon County. In the 1912 provincial election he ran as the Conservative candidate in Saskatoon City but was again defeated. He served in World War I as a lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his military service. He returned to Saskatchewan after the war and resumed his medical practice and political activity. He was appointed lieutenant governor of the province by Conservative federal Prime Minister R.B. Bennett in 1931. In the midsts of the economic crisis, Muroe used his office to raise money for relief projects and charity. Nevertheless, many Canadians viewed the ceremonial office as a frivolity and excess during times of hardship and there was a movement to abolish the position. However, the provincial Legislature overwhelmingly defeated a motion to suspend the Office of the Lieutenant-Governor in 1934. Munroe retired from office in 1936."

  "text" : "Henry Bishop Brodess (1830 – October 20, 1881) was the first mayor of Ashland, Kentucky. Before being elected, he was a local judge, and published an outspoken anti-slavery newspaper called the American Union. In 1860, Brodess was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. On May 14, 1861, in Ashland, a meeting of citizens was held in Central Park to recruit members for the Ashland Home Guard, an organization formed for \"the defense and protection of our families and homes\" from guerrilla raiders. The Home Guard had at the time of the meeting a roster of 31 members. Forty new members took an oath of allegiance to the state and nation at that time. Brodess was among them. Starting around November 15, 1862, Brodess served as a first lieutenant in Company A of the Fourteenth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. He tendered his own resignation and was honorably discharged on November 17, 1862. In 1876, Brodess was elected mayor of Ashland, and a city council replaced to former town board. Mayor Brodess was elected for another two-year term in 1878, and again in 1880, but died in office. John Means was appointed to serve the remainder of his term. In 1912, his wife, Mary, claimed that, after his discharge, he was not paid travel pay, and she attempted to bring the case against the United States. On February 12 of that year it was decided that the claim was neither a legal nor equitable one, and any payment rested in the bounty of Congress"

Later he was made a Native Land Court assessor. By the mid-1870s he became disillusioned with the Native Land Court and began to call for Maori control over land title and land alienation. He represented the Northern Maori electorate from 1879 when he defeated Hori Tawhiti, to 1884 when he retired. He debated effectively on a number of race relations issues. In 1881 and 1882 he promoted a Native Committees Bill to limit the power of the Native Land Court, and give Maori control of awarding land titles. Tawhai died in July 1894."

At the AME's 1921 Kentucky Annual Conference, he \"paid high tribute to the sterling qualities of the colored citizens.\" At the twenty-first annual meeting of the Kentucky State Bar Association in 1922, he represented Ashland. According to the editor's note of Dysard's \"A History of the Iron Hill School\", Dysard was \"one of Carter County's most prominent sons\" and an able lawyer. He was, according to it, elected judge of Carter County in November 1901, taking office in 1902 and holding the position until 1905. At the November election, 1905, he was elected County Attorney of Carter County and held office until he moved to Ashland in 1909. He was BarExaminer for the State of Kentucky and was appointed by Governor Fields as Election Commissioner for Kentucky. He died in 1960."

He is currently the Member of the Sabah State Assembly for the constituency of Luyang, sitting in the assembly for Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) - Barisan Nasional after being an independent a while in 2013. From 2008 to 2013 he was the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Kota Kinabalu constituency in Sabah, representing the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP). Hiew had contested the federal Kota Kinabalu seat in the 2002 by-election and Malaysian general election, 2004 losing on each occasion. He won the seat in the 2008 election. In a four-way election, he narrowly defeated Christina Liew of fellow opposition party PKR and Barisan Nasional's Chin Teck Meng. The election was regarded as an unexpected loss by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Hiew relinquished his federal seat in 2013, instead contesting, and winning, the State Assembly seat of Luyang. In September 2013, he resigned from the DAP to become an independent in the State Assembly due to his defiance of the party in supporting Lajim Ukin over Wilfred Bumburing to be the leader of the opposition in the assembly. Hiew joined the Malaysian Chinese Association in 2014 after an invitation by the party in June that year."

At the 1865 general election he stood in the two-seat Monmouthshire county constituency, a county where owned he a large house called Llantilio Court, at Llantilio Crossenny, near Abergavenny, having inherited it in 1847 from a cousin.However, Monmouthshire had been a solidly Conservative seat since 1841, and in the constituency's first contested election since the Reform Act 1832, Morgan-Clifford came a poor third behind the two Conservative candidates. Morgan-Clifford's heir and only surviving child was his daughter Marion, who married James Fitzwalter Butler (1839–1899), the 15th and 25th Baron Dunboyne. In 1860 they changed their surname by royal licence to Clifford-Butler."

She was elected as the running mate of sitting independent Michael Moore on the Moore Independents Group ticket, but sat in the Assembly as an independent. She was unsuccessful in recontesting her seat at the 1995 election on Moore's ticket, and again on an attempt to regain her seat at the 1998 election as an unaligned independent. In 1998, ACT Minister for Urban Services, Brendan Smyth claimed that Szuty made inappropriate representations to him on behalf of a client of the real estate agency where Szuty had recently been employed. Szuty made representations that her client was facing severe hardship. As a result of Smyth's complaint, made in confidence, to the Real Estate Institute of the ACT, Szuty was dismissed by her employer. Szuty asked Smyth to withdraw his complaint; which he ignored. On the basis of the complaint, Szuty claimed that she had been allegedly defamed, and Smyth's actions adversely affected her employment and had ultimately forced her to leave the ACT. Szuty commenced defamation proceeding in the ACT Supreme Court. In a finding that was handed down in 2004, Chief Justice Higgins was scathing in his criticism of Smyth, but ruled that the defamatory remarks he had made about Szuty were protected by qualified privilege. Szuty subsequently moved to Tanunda, South Australia. She edited The Visitors Monthly magazine in Burra from 2001 to 2011, and as of 2016 is the spokesperson for the Group of Concerned Burra and District Residents and the Ratepayers Action Group (Regional Council of Goyder). She contested the Burra Ward of the Regional Council of Goyder at the 2010 and 2014 local government elections and again at a 2016 supplementary election, but was unsuccessful on each occasion."

He was defeated at the 1924 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Walter Runciman, but at the 1929 general election Ruciman stood instead in St Ives and Samuel regained the seat. In 1931, when Labour had split over its leader Ramsay MacDonald's decision to leave the party and form a Conservative Party-dominated National Government, he faced only one opponent, the Liberal National candidate Lewis Jones, who took the seat. Samuel did not stand for Parliament again."

  "text" : "Herbert Charles Wilson (December 7, 1859 – December 17, 1909) was a Canadian politician and physician. He served as mayor of the Town of Edmonton and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. Wilson was born in 1859 in what would become the province of Ontario. The son of a manufacturer, Wilson's family had extensive business interests in the area of Picton, Ontario. Wilson studied medicine and moved to Edmonton in 1882, one of the first physicians to settle there. He was appointed to official medical positions and, for several years, owned a drugstore in town. He served as a consultant to First Nations reserves near Edmonton and also became a director of many local corporations. He was elected to the Territorial council in 1885, and soon became its speaker. During his speakership, he helped to change the council's rules and procedures. He left territorial politics after six years, citing health reasons. He maintained a medical practice in town for many years, and went to considerable efforts to keep up with the latest practices. Wilson interested himself in civic activities in Edmonton, and eventually ran for mayor, winning election in 1895. He left office after less than two years in a dispute over town funds. He attempted a comeback in 1904, but was defeated in a run for the town council. He married in 1886, and had a son and two daughters. He died in 1909; an industrial park in the city is named for him."

He is currently the leader of the Egyptian Popular Current and a co-leader of the National Salvation Front. An opposition activist during the Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak eras, Sabahi was jailed 17 times during their presidencies for political dissidence. He was an immediate supporter and participant of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Sabahi entered the 2012 Egyptian presidential race in which he finished third place with 21.5% of the vote trailing the second place candidate Ahmed Shafiq by a margin of 700,000 votes. In the 2014 presidential election he was one of just two candidates. He ran second with less than 4% of the vote. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was declared the winner after attracting 22 million of the nearly 23 million votes cast. Sisi sworn into office as President of Egypt on 8 June 2014. A well known opposition figure, Sabahi ascribes to Nasserism and in 1996 he founded the Nasserist Karama (Dignity) Party. Sabahi ran as an independent and not as the Dignity Party's candidate. One of the few secular figures without any ties to the regime of Hosni Mubarak, Sabahi has attracted the support of several leading Nasserists. Sabahi is running under the slogan \"one of us\" which highlights his strong ties with the working class and advocates his socialist aspirations. Sabahi also gained the support of prominent Egyptian figures including writer and political activist Alaa Al Aswany and director and film-writer Khaled Youssef."

  "text" : "Herbert Stanley Morrison, Baron Morrison of Lambeth CH PC (3 January 1888 – 6 March 1965) was a British Labour politician who held a variety of senior positions in the Cabinet. During the inter-war period he served as Minister of Transport during the 1929-31 Labour Government then, after losing his seat in Parliament in 1931, as Leader of the London County Council in the 1930s. Returning to the Commons in 1935, he was defeated by Clement Attlee in the Labour leadership election that year, but later served as Home Secretary in the wartime coalition. Morrison organised Labour's victorious 1945 election campaign, and served as Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister in Attlee's governments of 1945–51. Attlee, Morrison, Ernest Bevin, Stafford Cripps and (initially) Hugh Dalton formed the \"Big Five\" who dominated those governments. Morrison oversaw Labour's nationalisation programme, although he opposed Aneurin Bevan's proposals for a nationalised hospital service as part of the setting up of the National Health Service. Morrison developed his social views from his work in local politics, and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. In the final year of Attlee's premiership Morrison served an unhappy term as Foreign Secretary. Morrison was widely expected to succeed Attlee as Labour leader, but Attlee, who disliked him, postponed stepping down until 1955. Morrison, who was considered too old, came a poor third in the ensuing Labour leadership election."

He was born in Ontario, but both his parents died before he was one year old, and he was raised by a grandmother in Galt, Ontario and uncles who lived near Carlisle, England. Forster travelled with Harold Topham, a British climber, during Topham's visit to the Selkirks in 1890. In 1912, he married Meda Hume. He had purchased a ranch in the upper Columbia Valley in 1898. Forster was the owner of the SS Selkirk, a sternwheeler steamboat that he had transported by rail to the upper Columbia River. He and John Lundy, a house guest, were shot by a Cranbrook man who had asked the two men for liquor and been refused. Forster's house was burned in an attempt to cover up the crime. Frank Sylvester was hanged for the murder of John Lundy the following year. Mount Forster, Forster Creek and Forster Pass were named after him."

Chesson also served on the Adelaide Trades Hall management committee and Eight Hours Committee, and as president and vice-president of the United Labor Party. Chesson was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1905 election in the seat of Port Adelaide, shifting to the new seat of West Torrens following an electoral redistribution in 1915. He was chairman of committees from 1915 to 1918. Chesson left the Labor Party for the new National Party in the 1917 Labor split over conscription. He was defeated by a Labor candidate when he ran for re-election at the 1918 election. After leaving politics, he was clerk of works in the department of the Architect-in-Chief. He died at his home in Croydon in July 1948, aged 85. He had celebrated his diamond wedding anniversary that January."

  "text" : "Hollis Earl Roberts (May 9, 1943 – October 19, 2011) was a Native American politician whose career was highlighted by his 19-year period as chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Hollis Roberts was born in Hochatown to Laura Beam Roberts and Darrell E. Roberts. He attended Holly Creek Elementary and Idabel High School, graduating in 1961. Roberts married Helen R. Rodriguez in 1963. They had three children: two boys and one girl. Following his political career, Roberts died on October 19, 2011 at 68 years of age. Roberts remains an extremely polarizing and controversial figure among Native Americans. His 19-year reign as Chief of the Choctaw Nation came to end in 1997 amid convictions of sexual contact and sexual abuse. From these convictions (leading to an eleven-year prison sentence and removal from office), to his then-extravagant $120,000 per year salary, to his alleged corruption; all have led to a negative public opinion of Roberts. Nevertheless, he served for 19 years as chief of the one of the largest Native American tribes in the United States. He governed well over 195,000 members, including over 79,000 in Oklahoma."

  "text" : "Hoani Paraone Tunuiarangi (1843 – 29 March 1933), referred to as Major Brown by Europeans in later life, was a notable New Zealand tribal leader, guide, interpreter, assessor, politician, and writer. Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngāti Kahungunu and Rangitāne iwi. He was born in Whakatomotomo, Wairarapa, New Zealand in about 1843. From 1892, he was a member of Te Kotahitanga, the autonomous Māori Parliament. One of six candidates in the 1893 election for the Eastern Maori electorate, he came second to the incumbent, Wi Pere. He was one of the owners of Lake Wairarapa and took a stance supportive of the government's view of land ownership. His support was acknowledged by him being appointed captain of a volunteer force, and he was to train 18 Māori as a guard of honour for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Richard Seddon, Tunuiarangi, and his guard of honour travelled to London on the Ruahine. In conjunction with Wi Pere and James Carroll, he had secretly prepared a petition concerning the remaining land held by Māori to remain in their ownership in perpetuity. Scottish MP John McAusland Denny presented the petition on Tunuiarangi's behalf to Joseph Chamberlain, and Tunuiarangi received an invitation from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to explain his concerns. The petition caused great embarrassment to the Liberal Government of New Zealand, and is regarded as one of the reasons of the government passing the Native Lands Settlement and Administration Bill 1898, the precursor to the Maori Lands Administration Act 1900. From 1912, he lived in Carterton. After a long illness, he died on 29 March 1933, and was survived by a daughter and son from the first of his three wives."

After the First World War served as German propaganda chief throughout the Upper Silesia plebiscite. Lukaschek headed a committee that investigated all possibilities to engage in plebiscite propaganda. The Silesian Committee was to create common propaganda themes to which all factions could subscribe, and was helped in its task by money from German government. Lukaschek propaganda actions were also sponsored by state finances. He remained in Polish Silesia till 1927, officially as a member of mixed Polish-German Commission organised under the auspice of League of Nations, in secret he organised a spying network for Germany in Polish Upper Silesia during that time. When the network was discovered in years 1926–1927, Polish minister Zaleski asked the commission for cancellation of Lukaschek's position. Lukaschek offered his resignation in Berlin, after the first attempt was rejected by German state, he offered it second time, stating that he no longer is able to conduct his mission. He was Oberpräsident (chief administrator) of the Prussian Province of Upper Silesia, in this role he was active against Poles in his region; after a Polish gymnasium was opened in Bytom he issued a letter to German government claiming that it represented a threat to German interests, and ordered close surveillance of both teachers and Polish pupils As a state official Lukaschek tried to conceal his anti-Polish stance, while discreetly opposing re-approachment between Poles and Germans pursued by some German catholic and pacifist organisations in his region He was removed from his offices by the Nazis and, as a lawyer practicing in Breslau joined the anti-Nazi resistance (Kreisauer Kreis) until his imprisonment in 1944/45.The Nazi court acquitted him in trialThe July 20th plotters who wanted to remove Hitler from power, but also to keep Poland occupied by Germany and restore borders from 1914, planned to make Lukaschek the governor of Silesia After the war, Lukaschek joined the Christian Democrates in the Soviet Occupation Zone and became minister in Thuringia before he fled to the Allied occupation zones in 1947 and in April of the following year was appointed vice president of the British and US zones' supreme court. From 1949 to 1953, he was minister for the expellees in West Germany. In August 1952 Lukaschek was reported by British press as saying that Germany's former eastern territories, ' including those occupied by Czechoslovakia will become German again, the paper naming him a \"neo-nationalist voice\".He was also an honorary chairman of General Association for the Protection of Officials an organisations focused on the interests of those who managed to successfully pass the denazification process,an which was engaged in vigorous propaganda on behalf of Germans expelled from Central and Eastern Europe, Lukashek was also engaged in convincing German ministry of finance to provide 350 million marks annually by the West German state for former officials of Nazi Germany."

  "text" : "Hermann Gossler (born 21 August 1802 in Hamburg, died 10 May 1877 in Hamburg) was a Hamburg lawyer, senator (1842–77) and First Mayor and President of the Senate of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (i.e. the city republic's head of state and head of government) in 1874. He was Second Mayor in 1870, 1871 and 1873. During much of his tenure as senator and his first term as Second Mayor, Hamburg was a fully sovereign country, while after 1871, the First Mayor as head of state of republican Hamburg was equal to the federal princes (Bundesfürsten) within the German Empire. As a senator, he also served as Lord of Police (Polizeiherr), the equivalent of a Minister of Police. He belonged to the Hanseatic Berenberg-Gossler banking dynasty and was a son of the banker and senator Johann Heinrich Gossler (1775–1842), co-owner of Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co, and the grandson of Johann Hinrich Gossler. His brothers Johann Heinrich Gossler (1805-1879) and Wilhelm Gossler continued the firm. His nephew Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was conferred Baronial rank in 1910. Hermann Gossler studied law at the University of Heidelberg, and worked as a lawyer in Hamburg from 1826 to 1837. He became Senate Secretary (roughly comparable to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State) in 1837. From 1838 to 1842, he was Secretarius of the High Court. In 1842 he was elected Senator. He was the father of Emilie (Emmy) Helene Gossler (1838–1910), married to banker Georg Heinrich Kaemmerer."

The historical seat of Bayt Shennib is Derna, Cyrenaica. On April 3, 2013 the family's significant contributions to the Libyan people were publicly recognized by the current Libyan government and their honors restored, if in name only. The area of Bi'r`Ayt Shinnib west of Derna is named after the family."

  "text" : "Henrique Batista Duffles Teixeira Lott (November 16, 1894 - May 19, 1984) was a Brazilian military and political figure. A former military attache in the United States, Lott was promoted to General in 1944. After President Getúlio Vargas' suicide in 1954, his successor Café Filho appointed Lott, known for his loyalty to the constitutional government, Minister of War. After Filho's resignation for health reason on November 9, 1955 (with less than three months of his term left), President of the Chamber of Deputies Carlos Luz assumed the Presidency, as President-elect Juscelino Kubitschek and Vice President-elect João Goulart were to be inaugurated next January. As the military itself were bitterly divided politically, there were fears that part of it, with support of President Luz, would attempt to prevent elected leaders from taking office. Lott played a key role in a so-called \"Revolution of November 11\", outsing Luz after just three days in power, and installing next in line Senate First Vice President Nereu Ramos until Kubitschek and Goulart were sworn in. Lott continued to serve as Minister under Kubitschek administration. In 1960, by now Marshal placed in reserve, he was term-limited President's hand picked choice, running under Social Democratic and Labour banner and was defeated by Jânio Quadros in landslide. However his running mate, Vice President Goulart, was elected (at the time, Brazilian President and Vice President were elected separately). After Quadros' surprising resignation just seven months in office, Marshal Lott sided with those supporting Goulart's right to Presidency. After 1964 military coup Lott retired from public life, displeased with his colleagues ousting a legal government."

  "text" : "Henry Theodore Titus (February 13, 1823 – August 7, 1881) was the founder of Titusville, Florida. He was born in Trenton, New Jersey on February 13, 1823. He was the first of nine children of Theodore Titus, and Catharine Flick Howell. He was raised in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He was enrolled for some time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but did not graduate. In 1845, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia. Titus was a leader of the Narciso López filibuster expeditions that invaded Cuba in 1850-1851. He was a grocer and sawmill operator in Jacksonville, until migrating with his family to \"Bleeding Kansas\" in April 1856 to join pro-slavery forces. He resided at \"Fort Titus,\" a double-log cabin one mile south of Lecompton, that came under artillery attack from John Brown's raiders on Aug. 16, 1856. He was wounded, captured, and exchanged for Free-State prisoners, before joining filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua in Feb. 1857. After his force was defeated at Castillo Viejo a few weeks later, Titus went to New York. He and his brother Elliot moved to the Sonoita Valley, Arizona, where they operated various ore mines during 1858-1860. Titus returned to Jacksonville during the American Civil War and served as assistant quartermaster in the Florida Militia. He was also working for the Florida Provision Company, a business owned by his father-in-law, Edward S. Hopkins. The firm sold supplies to the Confederate Army. While transporting a load of Confederate draft dodgers to Nassau in 1863, Titus lost his steamer to the Northern blockade and was captured on the Indian River. He eluded imprisonment and later returned to Florida with his family, preceding a post-war wave of newcomers. He moved to New York with his family in 1865, but returned to Florida in November 1867, settling at Sand Point which at that time had a population of 250. Titus built a sawmill, general store and hotel at that location. Titus was appointed postmaster, and soon thereafter renamed the settlement \"Titusville.\" The name of Titusville was determined by a dominoes game with Captain Clark Rice on October 16, 1873. He lobbied tirelessly to have Titusville named as county seat. His efforts were realized on October 7, 1879 when a vote was taken and the result supported relocation of the county seat to Titusville. He was also the Justice of the Peace, a notary public for Volusia County, and a marine insurance underwriter's agent. Rheumatic gout kept him confined to a wheelchair during the last years of his life."

Born in 1919 in Granville Ferry, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, How was a graduate of the University of New Brunswick. How was a resident of Wolfville when he entered provincial politics in the 1970 election, being elected MLA for Kings South. He was re-elected in the 1974, 1978, and 1981 elections. On October 5, 1978, How was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Attorney General and Provincial Secretary. He held the positions until November 1983, when he retired from politics and was appointed Chief Judge of the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia. Prior to the 1993 election, How returned to provincial politics and defeated incumbent MLA Derrick Kimball for the Progressive Conservative nomination in his old riding of Kings South. In the general election, Liberal Robbie Harrison defeated How by 128 votes, while Kimball who ran as an independent finished third. How briefly returned to political life in 2000 when he joined the Canadian Alliance, and campaigned against federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark in the September 2000 Kings—Hants byelection. How died in Kentville on February 1, 2001."
