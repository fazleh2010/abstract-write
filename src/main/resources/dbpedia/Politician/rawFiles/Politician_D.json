  "text" : "David Michael Davis (born 23 December 1948) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union since 13 July 2016. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union."

  "text" : "Daniel E. \"Danny\" Williams, QC, MHA (born August 4, 1949) is a Canadian politician, businessman and lawyer who served as the ninth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador between November 6, 2003, and December 3, 2010. Williams was born and raised in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Before entering politics Williams was a highly successful lawyer and businessman.After becoming Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001, he was elected to the House of Assembly in a by-election for the district of Humber West in Corner Brook. Williams' premiership was considered controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador. Events such as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings, and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, garnered national attention. While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador, he was continuously ranked as one of the most popular premiers in Canada, with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties."

  "text" : "David Cameron Chatters (April 15, 1946 – January 25, 2016) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Canadian House of Commons from 1993 to 2006, representing the riding of Athabasca until the 2004 election, after which he represented Westlock—St. Paul. Born in Westlock, Alberta, Chatters, formerly a farmer and rancher, was first elected as a member of the Reform Party of Canada (1993–2000), which became the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which became the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. For over 10 years, he was the Senior Opposition Critic for Natural Resources and was a Deputy Whip of the Official Opposition. He was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics, but health reasons made Chatters retire at the 2006 election. In May 1996, he was suspended from the Reform Party caucus for asserting, in the wake of the Delwin Vriend case on LGBT human rights, that schools should have the right to fire openly gay teachers. Another caucus colleague who had made a similar comment, Bob Ringma, was suspended at the same time; a third caucus colleague, Jan Brown, was also suspended at the same time for publicly criticizing Chatters and Ringma. All three were readmitted to the Reform caucus by September of that year. He died at the age of 69 on January 25, 2016. He had pancreatic cancer."

Taverne's 1973 victory in Lincoln was short-lived; Labour regained the seat at the October 1974 general election. However, his success opened the possibility of a realignment on the left of British politics, which took shape in 1981 as the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which Taverne joined.

  "text" : "Daisaku Ikeda (池田 大作 Ikeda Daisaku, born 2 January 1928, Japan) is a Buddhist philosopher, educator, author, and anti-nuclear activist. He served as the third president of the Soka Gakkai, the largest of Japan's new religious movements. Ikeda is the founding president of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), the world's largest Buddhist lay organization, with approximately 12 million practitioners in 192 countries and regions. Ikeda was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1928, to a family of seaweed farmers. He survived the devastation of World War II as a teenager, which he said left an indelible mark on his life and fueled his quest to solve the fundamental causes of human conflict. At age 19, Ikeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism and joined a youth group of the Soka Gakkai Buddhist association, which led to his lifelong work developing the global peace movement of SGI and founding numerous institutions dedicated to fostering peace, culture and education. Ikeda's vision for the SGI has been described by academic observers as a \"borderless Buddhist humanism that emphasizes free thinking and personal development based on respect for all life.\" In the 1960s, Ikeda worked to reopen Japan's relationship with China, to establish the Soka education network of humanistic schools from kindergartens through universities, and he began writing The Human Revolution. In the 1970s, he established the Soka Gakkai International and initiated numerous international educational and cultural exchanges for peace. Since the 1980s, he has continually increased his anti-nuclear activism and citizen diplomacy. As of 2015, Ikeda has published more than 50 dialogues with scholars, peace activists and leading world figures. In his role as SGI president, Ikeda has visited 55 nations and spoken on subjects including peace, environment, economics, women's rights, interfaith dialogue, nuclear disarmament, Buddhism and science, and various other topics. Every year on the anniversary of the SGI's founding, January 26, Ikeda submits a peace proposal to the United Nations."

He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington's Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair's Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1896 when he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province's Supreme Court. He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins."

  "text" : "David William Tollner (born 31 January 1966) is an Australian politician. He was the Country Liberal Party member for Solomon in the Australian House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, and then served in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly as the member for Fong Lim from 2008 to 2016. He was the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory under chief minister Adam Giles from 2013 to 2014. Tollner was born in Biloela, Queensland, and worked as a manager and company director before entering politics. He contested the 1997 territory election as an independent, narrowly losing to CLP candidate Chris Lugg in the seat of Nelson. He subsequently won the new federal seat of Solomon for the CLP at the 2001 federal election, and was re-elected at the 2004 election. He was narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Damian Hale at the 2007 election. Tollner then contested the 2008 territory election, winning the new seat of Fong Lim and defeating Labor minister Matthew Bonson. He was re-elected at the 2012 election, and upon the CLP's victory was appointed Minister for Health, Minister for Alcohol Rehabilitation and Policy, and Minister for Housing. In March 2013, Mills expelled Tollner from his cabinet after a heated disagreement between the two at a party meeting. According to former MLA Daryl Manzie, Tollner swore at Mills and threw a stack of cabinet papers at him before walking out of the room. Tollner was appointed deputy chief minister of the Northern Territory on 13 March 2013. He caused controversy in August 2014 when he referred to the gay son of fellow CLP MP Gary Higgins as a \"pillow biter\" and \"shirt lifter\". As a result, it was announced that Tollner's resignation as deputy leader of the CLP had been accepted. Despite that, Tollner said a few days later that he wanted to be restored to his former position or he would quit the party, leaving it in a precarious position on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. On 1 September, Chief Minister Adam Giles threw open the leadership and deputy leadership to a party room ballot. Giles was re-elected as CLP leader, and Peter Chandler was voted in as his deputy. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election all but erased Tollner's majority in Fong Lim, slashing it from a fairly safe 7.3 percent to an extremely marginal 0.2 percent. Tollner tried to transfer to the newly created seat of Spillett, which had absorbed much of the eastern portion of Fong Lim. However, he lost a November 2015 preselection battle to Lia Finocchiaro, the member for neighbouring Drysdale. His senior advisor, Tim Dixon, was pre-selected for Fong Lim, but lost the seat to Labor."

  "text" : "David Chernushenko (born June 1963 in Calgary, Alberta) is a politician, professional speaker, sustainability consultant and documentary filmmaker in Ontario, Canada. He was elected to Ottawa City Council in the 2010 municipal election and re-elected for a second term in 2014. He is the former senior deputy to the leader of the Green Party of Canada, and a former leadership contestant for that party. A graduate of Queen's University (Political Science) and alumnus of Cambridge University (International Relations), Chernushenko has worked for the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) and the United Nations Environment Programme. He has served on committees and boards of local housing and environment groups, schools and health advisory bodies. Chernushenko is a “green building” professional accredited by the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification program. As owner of the consulting firm Green & Gold Inc. since 1998, he has advised public, private, and non-profit organizations on adopting more sustainable and socially responsible practices. From 1998 to 2004, Chernushenko served on the International Olympic Committee’s commission on Sport and the Environment. He has written several books on sustainable management practices, including Sustainable Sport Management (UNEP, 2001) and Greening Our Games: Running Sports Events & Facilities that Won't Cost the Earth (Centurion, 1994), and the electronic publication Greening Campuses and their Communities (IISD/ACCC/UNEP, 1996). In 2001, he co-founded Clean Air Champions, a national charity that engages athletes in raising awareness about air pollution, climate change and the benefits of physical activity in Canada. He is a director of the Sustainable Ottawa Energy Co-operative. He was the Green Party candidate for Ottawa Centre in the 2004 federal election. He finished fourth with 4,730 votes (8%), receiving more votes than any other Green candidate in Ottawa. He ran again in Ottawa Centre in the 2006 federal election and again came fourth, losing to Paul Dewar from the New Democratic Party (NDP). Chernushenko received 6,766 votes (10.2%), the highest vote count of any Green Party candidate in Canada the 2006 election. He passed the 10% threshold, thus becoming eligible for partial government reimbursement of campaign expenditures. Chernushenko was endorsed by the Ottawa Citizen newspaper in the 2004 and 2006 elections. He also ran as the Green Party candidate in Ottawa South in the 2003 Ontario general election. On November 10, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Chernushenko to Canada's National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a non-partisan panel that advises the federal government on environmental policy, and works to promote the integrated pursuit of excellence in environmental, social and economic practices in Canada’s public, private and civil society sectors. Chernushenko served as a member on the NRTEE from 2006 to 2009, and served as vice-chair in 2008-2009. Chernushenko resigned as deputy leader of the Green Party in July 2007 in order to devote more time to his international consulting business and the NRTEE, and to make documentary films. Since then, he has launched the Living Lightly multimedia project and produced three documentaries, titled Be the Change (2008), Powerful: Energy for Everyone (2010) and Bike City, Great City (2013). Chernushenko ran as City Councillor for Capital Ward in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election. He won with 41.34% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2014."

  "text" : "Donald J. Atchison is a Canadian politician who was elected mayor of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on October 22, 2003. He won a close four-way contest, running on a platform that included being tough on crime, freezing property taxes, and resuming control of the city's police commission. He was re-elected as mayor in 2006, 2009 and 2012. At the end of his current term in 2016, he will become the longest-serving mayor in Saskatoon's history at 13 years. Prior to being mayor, Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon's city council as a councillor for Ward 10 in 1994, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. As a city councillor, Atchison suggested a part of downtown Saskatoon should be enclosed by a $80 million 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium, dubbed the \"Atreos.\" He also is known to be precise about his dress, as he owns a men's clothing store. On his first election as mayor, he required citizens visiting the Mayor's office to be formally dressed, a policy that was soon dropped after being criticized. Both points were ridiculed by CBC satirist Rick Mercer who sponsored an online contest that went on to name Atchison \"Canada's Craziest Mayor.\""

  "text" : "Sir Douglas Colin Cameron KCMG (June 8, 1854 – November 27, 1921) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Ontario Legislature from 1902 to 1905, and was the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1911 to 1916. Cameron was born in Hawkesbury, Canada West (now Ontario), and was educated at Vankleek Hill High School. He did not attend college. Cameron moved to Manitoba in 1878, and worked as a contractor at Brandon. Cameron then moved to Rat Portage (now Kenora), which was claimed by both Manitoba and Ontario at the time. He oversaw developments in the lumbering and mining trades, opened a saw mill, and was one of the founders of the Maple Leaf Flour Mills. In later years, he would become President of Rat Portage Lumber Company. Cameron entered politics in 1901, having been elected as a councillor in Rat Portage. He would later serve as the city's mayor. In 1902, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal for the riding of Fort William and Lake of the Woods, defeating Conservative Thomas Smellie, 1483 votes to 1121. Cameron sat as a backbench supporter of Premier George Ross for the next three years. The Liberals lost the election of 1905, and Cameron lost his own riding to Smellie, 1536 votes to 1228. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Winnipeg to better oversee his business ventures. Cameron stood as a Liberal candidate for Winnipeg in the 1908 federal election, but lost to Conservative Alexander Haggart by 8747 votes to 6729. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier appointed Cameron Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba on August 1, 1911. The position was largely ceremonial by this time, and Cameron had little involvement in the day-to-day affairs of the province's government. In 1915, however, Cameron used his constitutional authority to call a Royal Commission of Enquiry into an ongoing scandal involving the construction costs of the province's new legislative buildings. The Commission upheld charges against Rodmond P. Roblin's government by the opposition Liberals, and Roblin was forced to resign. Cameron was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1914 New Year Honours. Cameron's term in office ended in 1916. He died in 1921."

  "text" : "Dingley Askham Brittin (1823–1881) was an English solicitor. He spent three years in New Zealand as a runholder and during that time, he represented the Christchurch Country electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives for one term. Brittin was born in Huntingdonshire, England in 1823. He received an education as a solicitor, but during his time in New Zealand, he did not practice in that profession. Brittin came out to New Zealand on the Minerva in 1853, together with his wife, and his brother John Danns Brittin, his wife and son. The Minerva, one of the ships chartered by the Canterbury Association, had left London on 29 September and Plymouth on 12 October 1852, and arrived in Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Other notable passengers on the ship were Henry Sewell, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Jane and John Deans, Thomas Rowley, John Cuff, and Elizabeth Torlesse. The Brittin brothers took up run 105 at the mouth of the Rakaia River. They sold their land in 1854, and took land in the Port Hills. In the 1855 election, Brittin was one of four candidates in the two-member Christchurch Country electorate. He came second and represented the electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament in 1856, but resigned during the 1856 session before the end of his term; the Speaker read out his letter of resignation on 31 July, two weeks before the session finished. He had to return to England on 'urgent business' in 1856 and feared that he may not be back in time for the start of the 1857 parliamentary session. In fact, he did not return to New Zealand, and historian George Macdonald noted that he \"was not heard of again\" in Canterbury. The resulting by-election was won by John Ollivier, who beat Crosbie Ward. Brittin died in 1881 and is buried at All Saints, the Parish Church of St Ives. His wife Anna Maria Brittin, who died in 1902, is buried next to him."

He was born in the United States, at Hudson, New Hampshire to Enoch Sawyer March and Margaret Whittier. Marsh spent his youth in Nashua, New Hampshire, attending the public schools, and starting his working career there. As a young man, he served with the 30th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment and was a part of the Dakota Territory Indian campaigns. By 1876 Marsh was managing a small general store in Fort Benton, Montana, after which he joined the Fort Benton firm T. C. Power and Bro and in 1876 moved to Fort Walsh (in Saskatchewan) to manage their store, remaining at that post until 1883. As the Canadian Pacific Railway moved west, Marsh saw the opportunity to open up new stores for the company; he opened a store in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan in 1883, and opened a Calgary branch in 1884, remaining as manager of that post until 1893. He arranged for his nephew, Horace A. Greeley, to manage the store in Maple Creek. Marsh became a prominent moneylender soon after his arrival in Calgary. In 1887 he married Julia Wood Shurtliff, the widow of North-West Mounted Police superintendent Albert Shurtliff. They had one daughter. T. C. Power and Bro. sold the Calgary store to Marsh in 1893, and he continued operating it until 1901. Marsh served one term as mayor of the town of Calgary, from January 21, 1889, to January 20, 1890; he won by acclamation. Upon his death in Calgary, his estate was appraised at $351,000. The majority of his estate was left to Julia, who died two years later."

  "text" : "David Leonard Congdon (born 16 October 1949) is a British former Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon North East, South London from 1992 to 1997. Congdon had been also a councillor for many years and served as Deputy Leader of Croydon Council. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general selection, succeeding the outgoing speaker Bernard Weatherill who was retiring from the Commons. The Croydon seats were reorganised ahead of the 1997 General Election, with the loss of one seat. Congdon competed against Sir Paul Beresford, then MP for Croydon Central, for the Conservative nomination for the new merged seat and won. He then lost in the ensuing election in 1997 to Labour's Geraint Davies. Sir Paul Beresford, meanwhile, successfully contested Mole Valley and continued as an MP. Congdon stood once again against Geraint Davies at the 2001 election and lost. He then worked for MENCAP, and did not stand again at the 2005 election, when the Conservative candidate Andrew Pelling recaptured the seat from Davies. Congdon is now retired and lives, with his wife, Theresa, in Old Coulsdon."

  "text" : "Dennis Gruending Dennis Gruending is an Ottawa-based writer and a former Member of Parliament from Saskatchewan. He has worked as a print, radio and television journalist, as a radio host and has written or edited seven books. His anthology Great Canadian Speeches was a best seller and the Ottawa Citizen described it as “a history of Canada as seen from the podium.” He has also written biographies of Emmett Hall whose Royal Commission recommended Medicare for Canada, and of former Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney. Gruending’s book Pulpit and Politics: Competing Religious Ideologies in Canadian Public Life examines the competition between religious progressives and conservatives for power and influence in Canadian politics. Gruending was born in 1948 and raised in rural Saskatchewan and holds an Honours degree in English literature from the University of Saskatchewan, as well as a master's degree in journalism from Carleton University in Ottawa. In the 1970s, he worked as a reporter for the Prince Albert Daily Herald and the Saskatoon Star Phoenix and later as a feature writer for the Windsor star. Upon his return to Saskatchewan, he worked out of Regina for CBC Radio and Television as producer and reporter and later as co-host of Saskatchewan Today, CBC Radio’s early morning news and information program. He was a candidate for the New Democratic Party in four federal elections beginning in 1997 and served as an M.P. for the constituency of Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar in the 36th parliament. He was his party’s critic for the Environment and for International Development. After his defeat he spent several years as a self-employed consulting researcher and writer for numerous clients, including Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Canadian Wheat Board, the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, Library and Archives Canada, Oxfam and a number of Canadian-based unions. In 2008, he became Media Relations Coordinator for the Canadian Labour Congress, CLC, a position he held for six years. Following his tenure with the CLC, Gruending returned to journalism. He writes a personal blog called Pulpit and Politics as well as a blog called The Common Good for the United Church Observer. His blog pieces also appear regularly on Rabble.ca and he is a contributing editor to The Hill Times newspaper in Ottawa.

  "text" : "Diane Elizabeth Deans is a member of Ottawa City Council, Canada, representing Gloucester-Southgate Ward in the city's southeast, representing more than 49,500 residents. A graduate of the University of Guelph she was active in the Canadian Federation of Students before becoming a staffer on Parliament Hill. Deans was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1994. Prior to Ottawa and its surrounding municipalities were amalgamated in 2001, she faced a tough election against George Barrett. In the 2003 Ottawa election, she handily defeated two lesser-known opponents. After victory in the 2006 Ottawa election, Deans began her fifth term as Councillor for Gloucester-Southgate ward. In the 2010 election, Deans was re-elected in her Gloucester-Southgate Ward. She was once again re-elected in 2014 for her seventh consecutive term. Deans considers herself a centrist member of council but traditionally takes a liberal stance on most issues. In the mid-2000s, Deans' main concern had been the creation of a new branch for the Ottawa Public Library in her rapidly growing ward, now called the Greenboro Library. She also supported by-laws limiting smoking in the city, while not supporting a lawn pesticide bylaw in 2002 and 2005. She has engaged in public clashes with Mayor Bob Chiarelli while advocating for her ward. Deans is the Chairperson of the City's Community and Protective Services Committee of the City of Ottawa. She also sits on the Transportation Committee, the Finance and Economic Development Committee, Member Services Committee, and the Ottawa Community Lands Development Corporation. She is currently co-chair of the Seniors' Roundtable. Deans sought the federal Liberal nomination in the riding of Ottawa South in 2004. She lost to David McGuinty. She was seen as a possible candidate to challenge Chiarelli for the mayoralty in 2006, but chose to run for re-election in Gloucester-Southgate Ward. In March 2007, Diane Deans announced that she had been approached by members of the Ontario Liberal Party urging her to seek the party's nomination for the riding of Ottawa Centre. She received the support of the sitting MPP Richard Patten. On June 4, 2007, she lost the provincial nomination to Yasir Naqvi. Deans was married to former New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Ian Deans for 22 years."

She was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, and graduated from McGill University with a degree in Physical Education. She taught at McGill and the University of Toronto before moving to Ottawa. She was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 in a surprise victory over veteran alderman Joe Cassey. On city council, her priorities include housing, urban planning, community development, transportation, social services, women's issues and social justice causes. As a previous head of Heritage Ottawa she worked to preserve heritage structures. She was easily re-elected in 1985 and 1988. She considered a bid for the mayoralty in 1991, but ended up supporting fellow progressive Nancy Smith who came in a strong second (36%) to Jacquelin Holzman (40%). Holmes was easily re-elected to council in 1991. In 1994 Holmes moved to the council of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, facing little opposition in her bid. She was acclaimed in 1998 and retired from council in 2000 when the regional municipality was abolished and replaced with the new amalgamated City of Ottawa. In 2003 she returned to city council, winning another convincing victory in her previous ward. Holmes was similarly re-elected in 2006. Holmes supported a bylaw to require property owners to promptly remove graffiti. Holmes was re-elected in 2011."

Along with Peter Beattie, he was the leading figure in the push during the late 1970s to have the Queensland branch of the party reformed. After the success of the reform movement, and intervention from the party's federal headquarters, he became State Branch President. He was elected to the Parliament of Queensland for the electorate of Stafford at the 1983 state election. Murphy completed biographies on a number of Queensland ALP figures, notably Thomas J. Ryan and Bill Hayden. He was working on a biography of Andrew Fisher before his death. Murphy was diagnosed with cancer in 1983 and died in 1984, aged 47. He died before having the opportunity to make a speech as a Member of Parliament."

Due to the tiny size of the ALP caucus since the party's defeat at the 2012 election, she was a member of the shadow cabinet but did not become a minister as she retired at the 2015 election. At the 2012 election, Desley Scott retained her seat with a significant margin for a Labor MP of 5.8%, after a 19.57% swing against her party. According to Independent MP Alex Douglas, \"She was completely focussed on the needs of Woodridge residents, which in turn earned her the respect of her constituents.\", which led to her being one of only seven Queensland ALP MPs being elected at the 2012 election."

Barringer died in 1852 in Shelbyville, Tennessee. Barringer was the uncle of Daniel Moreau Barringer, also later a Congressman from North Carolina."

Between 2002 and 2010, he also served as the Leader of the Opposition by virtue of leading the second largest party in Parliament. First elected to Parliament in 1973, Baykal went on to serve as Minister of Finance in the CHP-MSP coalition of 1974 and as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in the third government of Bülent Ecevit from 1978 to 1979. With the CHP shut down during the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, Baykal was briefly imprisoned before being elected to Parliament once again in 1987 from the new Social Democratic People's Party (SHP). Baykal was one of the leading members of the re-established CHP, which was founded again in 1992. He served as the party's leader until 1995, when the CHP and SHP merged during a convention. He was re-elected leader in September 1995, after which Baykal contested the 1995 general election and formed a coalition government with Tansu Çiller's True Path Party. He served concurrently as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1995 and 1996. Leading the CHP into a landslide defeat in the 1999 general election, Baykal resigned after the party was entirely ejected from Parliament for failing to surpass the 10% election threshold. Regardless, he was re-elected as leader in 2000 and led the party to a moderate success in the 2002 general election, becoming the Leader of the Opposition. He resigned as leader in 2010 after the release of a video of Baykal's private relationship with another CHP MP. As the oldest MP in Parliament following the June 2015 general election, Baykal briefly served as the interim Speaker of the Grand National Assembly. He was the CHP's candidate to become the permanent Parliamentary Speaker for the 25th Parliament of Turkey in the June–July 2015 speaker elections, but lost to Justice and Development Party candidate İsmet Yılmaz. Following a breakdown of coalition talks after the election, Baykal was offered a ministerial position in the subsequent interim election government formed by AKP leader Ahmet Davutoğlu, which he turned down in line with the party executive's decision. He became interim parliamentary Speaker for a second time on 17 November 2015 by virtue of being the oldest MP after the November 2015 general election. He was succeeded by the AKP MP İsmail Kahraman, who was elected Speaker on 22 November 2015."

A mathematics graduate of Alverno College in 1953 and of Marquette University, she taught mathematics at Alverno College, at the University of Wisconsin–Parkside, and elsewhere around Milwaukee, Wisconsin, including at the then-new St. Joseph High School (Kenosha) when it opened in September 1957. Drufenbrock gained a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana in 1963. After teaching for 13 years at Alverno College, she taught at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College in her native Indiana for 18 years. Her interest in social issues led her to join the Socialist Party USA in 1976. She ran as their Vice-Presidential candidate in the 1980 United States presidential election, and served as that party's National Treasurer. That campaign resulted in the Party's recognition by the Federal Elections Commission as a national political party."

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1915, and later served as the 32nd Mayor of Winnipeg for two years. McLean was a member of the Conservative Party. McLean was born in Halton County, Ontario, the son of Mr. G. McLean, and was educated at public schools in Georgetown. McLean came to Manitoba in 1892. In 1895, he married A. Blanchard. He worked as a real estate broker and farmer, and served as president of McLean and Grisdale Ltd. He was also appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the 106th Regiment M.L.I. on April 1, 1912. In religion, McLean was a Presbyterian. McLean was an alderman in Winnipeg from 1907 to 1910, and a city controller from 1913 to 1914. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Robert Newton Lowery and Social Democrat Herman Saltzmann in Winnipeg North \"B\". The Conservatives won a majority government in this election, and McLean served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond P. Roblin's administration. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. McLean did not seek re-election. During World War I, McLean served overseas as commander of the 101st Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. From 1918 to 1919, he served on Headquarters Staff for Military Division No. 10. From 1919 to 1921, he was commander of the Winnipeg Light Infantry (10th Battalion). He attempted to return to the legislature in the 1922 provincial election. By this time, the city of Winnipeg had been re-designed as a single ten-member constituency, with members chosen by a single transferable ballot. McLean finished in 24th place on the first count with 515 votes, and was eliminated on the twenty-first count. He served as mayor of Winnipeg in 1928-29, succeeding fellow Conservative Ralph Humphreys Webb. He was defeated by Webb when he ran for reelection as mayor for 1930. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 82."

  "text" : "Doug McCallum is a former mayor of Surrey, British Columbia. McCallum was first elected to a seat on Surrey City Council in 1993. During this term he served as Chair of the Finance Committee and sat as a member of the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Library Board. Doug McCallum was elected mayor in the 1996 election. He is seen as being pro-business and development, enhancing public safety, and providing a zero property tax increase. He won re-election as Surrey's mayor in the 1999 and 2002 municipal elections. McCallum ran again for a fourth term in the 2005 municipal elections but was soundly defeated by his emergent rival, Dianne Watts, a former fellow member of his party, the Surrey Electors Team. McCallum then sought the Conservative Party nomination for the 2006 Canadian election in the riding on Newton—North Delta, after the incumbent Gurmant Grewal stepped down. McCallum missed the deadline and instead the Conservatives chose Phil Eidsvik. In 2010, McCallum was hired as CEO of Harness Racing of B. C. After Watts announced she would not seek re-election in 2014, McCallum announced his intention to run for the position in the November 2014 election. Part of his Safe Surrey Coalition campaign included resistance to the city's renovating Newton Athletic Park to recruit the USL Pro team of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC."

  "text" : "David Battle Turpie (July 8, 1828 – April 21, 1909) was an American politician. Turpie was born in Hamilton County, Ohio. He grew up in Ohio and graduated from Kenyon College in 1848. He studied law and moved to Logansport, Indiana where he set up a law practice. He soon became active in the United States Democratic Party to which he would belong for the rest of his life. Turpie was elected to the state legislature at the age of 24 in 1852. He served one term and then returned to practicing law. In 1854 he became a common pleas judge and in 1856 he became a state circuit court judge. In 1858 he was elected to the state legislature again for one year. Turpie was elected to the United States Senate from Indiana in January 1863, to fill the unexpired term of Jesse D. Bright who had been expelled for alleged disloyalty. The term was nearly complete, however, so Turpie only served in the Senate for one month. He returned to practicing law. Turpie moved to Indianapolis, Indiana in 1872. He was again elected to the state legislature and served as speaker of the Assembly from 1874 to 1875. He served as the United States District Attorney for Indiana from 1886 to 1887. In 1887, Turpie was again elected to the United States Senate from Indiana, this time for a full term. He defeated Benjamin Harrison who would soon become the President of the United States. His return to the U.S. Senate, after 24 years and 1 day out of office, marks the third longest gap in service to the chamber in history. Turpie was reelected in 1893 and served in the Senate for 12 years, from 1887 to 1899. As a senator, he served as chairman of the Committee on the Census from 1893 to 1895, chairman of the Democratic Conference from 1898 to 1899, and supported a plebiscite on annexation for the people of Hawaii rather than forced annexation. Turpie was defeated for reelection by Albert J. Beveridge. He retired from public life and died in Indianapolis."

  "text" : "Donald Howard Yarborough (December 15, 1925 - September 23, 2009), was a liberal Democratic politician who was reportedly the first Southern politician to endorse the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yarborough, an attorney in Houston, Texas, ran for governor of Texas in 1962, 1964, and 1968. In 1962, he came close to winning the primary runoff election against John B. Connally, Jr., having polled 49 percent of the ballots. Other intraparty rivals, considered conservatives, included the state attorney general, Will Wilson, highway commissioner Marshall Formby, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anticommunism the centerpiece of his race. The Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jack Cox, an oil equipment executive from Houston, was also a strong conservative and a former Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Although Yarborough never became governor, his campaigns contributed strongly to the reform of the Texas Democratic Party, uniting, behind Yarborough's candidacy, traditional New Deal loyalists, organized labor, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and reform-seeking liberals, thereby enabling this coalition to capture local constituencies in the Texas House and Senate and build organizations later drawn upon by Mark White and Ann Richards. Yarborough was born in New Orleans on December 15, 1925. His father was the president of a bank in New Orleans that went bust in the Great Depression, so Don was sent temporarily to spend part of his boyhood living with an aunt in Mississippi, where he helped out picking cotton in the fields of his family’s farm with the laborers. His father eventually got a job with the government and moved the family to Washington, D.C. His family also spent time during the years after the Depression living with relatives in Coral Gables, Florida. The family eventually moved together to Houston when he was 12. His mother, Inez Black Yarborough, served as head of the Women in Yellow volunteer corps at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. Upon graduating from San Jacinto High School at 17, Yarborough enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, entered officer’s training school and became a Company Commander at the age of 19. He served one year in China at the close of World War II. After the war, Yarborough entered the University of Texas, where he belonged to Kappa Alpha fraternity, and worked part-time to supplement the money he received under the G.I. bill. He earned his law degree in 1950. Yarborough re-entered the Marine Corps to serve during the Korean War as a member of the Judge Advocate General’s Corp (JAG Corps). He then returned to Texas to found his own law firm and take part in civic affairs. In 1956, as president of the Houston Junior Chamber of Commerce, Yarborough won the national debating championship for the organization due to his passionate speaking skills. In 1960, Yarborough married his first wife, Katherine Edwards. In 1963, Yarborough was named by LIFE magazine as one of the 100 young Americans who were \"distinguished by their dedication to something larger than private success, because they had the courage to act against old problems, the boldness to try out new ideas, and a hard-bitten, undaunted hopefulness about man. In his first run for political office, Yarborough ran for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1960. In 1962, he ran for the first time for governor, and in a field of five Democratic candidates, he reached a run-off with John Connally and came within 28,000 votes of winning the nomination, a nationally-noted near-upset in a state long dominated by the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He ran for governor again in 1964 and 1968. In political life he supported civil rights, economic justice, environmental protection, and women's equality, and he challenged the big business establishment that had long dominated Texas politics. After leaving politics, Yarborough promoted science as a means to ease suffering and cure aging, which he considered to be a disease that affected everyone. He worked as a lobbyist for Paraplegia Cure Research in Washington, D.C., where lived for many years on Capitol Hill and in Mclean, Va. He also played a role in the Council for a Livable World and was a founding member of biotech research companies. Yarborough died of Parkinson's disease on September 23, 2009. Yarborough was married three times, to Katherine Edwards Yarborough in 1960, to Gail Lind in 1978, and Houston realtor Charity O'Connell Yarborough in 1984."

  "text" : "Dennis T. Gorski (born July 20, 1944) is a politician in New York and a former Marine. A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo, New York and many of its suburbs. He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo."

  "text" : "Daniel Munroe Forney (1784–1847) was a United States Congressional Representative from North Carolina. He was born near Lincolnton, North Carolina, in May 1784, the son of Peter Forney. Forney attended the public schools and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He engaged in agricultural pursuits and served as a major in the War of 1812. He held several local offices. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Congresses and served from March 4, 1815, until his resignation in 1818. He was appointed by President James Monroe as a commissioner to treat with the Creek Indians in 1820. He served as a member of the North Carolina State senate, 1823-1826. He moved to Alabama in 1834 and settled in Lowndes County where he resumed agricultural pursuits and became interested in various business enterprises. Forney died in Lowndes County on October 15, 1847, and was interred in the family burying ground there. He was the uncle of William Henry Forney. His home in Lincoln County, North Carolina, Ingleside built about 1817, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972."

By 1890, Nicholl was editor of the league journal the Commonweal as political differences between the anarchists and the other socialists like William Morris sharpened, particularly after Bloody Sunday. These differences were largely over the use of violence in the immediate struggle. Nicholl had published articles one of which lamented that there were no fatalities during the Leeds gas strike riots. Contrary to what he regarded as Morris's defeatism Nicholl suggested; '\"Individual assaults on the system will lead to riots, riots to revolts, revolts to insurrection, insurrection to revolution.\"' Nicholl became very active in the defence of the Walsall Anarchists and was arrested along with Charles Mowbray (whose children were left alone in the house with the body of their dead mother who had just died)."

  "text" : "David Zirnhelt (born 1947) is a Canadian politician. He was born in Williams Lake, British Columbia, located in the Cariboo region of the province's central interior. He obtained an undergraduate and graduate degree from the University of British Columbia in political science and public administration, returning to the Williams Lake area, where he became a cattle rancher and a practitioner of horse logging. He was also active as a consultant in various federal, provincial, and First Nations projects related to public policy and economic development. Zirnhelt began his political career when he served as a director of the Cariboo Regional District from 1974 to 1977. In 1987, he was elected as a trustee of the Cariboo-Chilcotin School District. Zirnhelt made the leap to provincial politics in 1989, winning the seat of Cariboo in a by-election for the social democratic British Columbia New Democratic Party. The riding had, until then, been a stronghold of the conservative British Columbia Social Credit Party for almost forty years. Zirnhelt would go on to be re-elected in 1991 and 1996 in the riding of Cariboo South (the old Cariboo riding was abolished with the 1991 election). With the election of a New Democratic government in 1991, Premier Mike Harcourt appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Economic Development, Small Business and Trade. He later served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. Following Harcourt's resignation, Premier Glen Clark appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Forests — a powerful portfolio in a province where forestry is a major economic sector. In that position, Zirnhelt initiated an intensive review of the province's forest practices, as concerns mounted over the logging of old growth forests and the insufficient restocking of logged areas by timber companies. Zirnhelt failed in his attempt at re-election in 2001."

Constable was elected the leader of the Island New Democrats on April 23, 2006 by a narrow margin over labour leader Mike DesRoches. He announced he would be running on an anti-privatisation and pro-universal health care and child care platform. Constable's leadership appeared to be welcomed by Islanders as early polls reported the NDP's support had risen from four to eight per cent. He contested the seat of Charlottetown-Victoria Park in the 2007 provincial election. In June 2006, Constable criticized Premier Pat Binns' government for gerrymandering the new electoral riding map to divide the province in an east vs. west conflict. Constable said it would only draw attention away from \"important\" issues like health care and education. He expressed support for the map introduced by Justice John A. McQuaid in 2004. Constable announced his resignation from the leadership of the party on August 26, 2007, citing personal reasons."

  "text" : "David Weitzman, QC (18 June 1898 – 6 May 1987) was a British Labour Party politician. Weitzman was educated at Hutchesons' Grammar School, Glasgow, Manchester Central School and Manchester University. He served in the Manchester Regiment in the First World War. After graduating he was called to the Bar (Gray's Inn) and became a member of the Northern Circuit. He contested Stoke Newington unsuccessfully at the 1935 general election but went on to win it in the 1945 election. In October 1947, he was convicted of conspiracy related to unlawful supply of toilet preparations (lipstick) by his brothers' Newington Supply Co. contrary to wartime regulations, and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and fined £500. This was quashed in March 1948. For the 1950 election his seat was reconstituted as Hackney North and Stoke Newington and he went on to represent the constituency for a further 29 years. For the five years leading up to his retirement in 1979, he was the last sitting British MP born in the 19th century, the oldest member of the House of Commons, and the last Member of Parliament to have served in the First World War. After his retirement, Robert Edwards became the oldest sitting British MP."

  "text" : "Dragan Primorac /ˈdrɑːɡən ˈpriːməˌræts/ (born June 7, 1965) is a university professor, pediatrician, geneticist and forensic science expert. He serves as Global Ambassador of The Penn State University and the Chair of International Affairs Committee of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Primorac became a politician as a member of Croatian Government, serving as the Minister of Science, Education and Sports between 2003 and 2009. He completed his first term (2003–2007) without any party affiliation. According to the International Republican Institute survey of October 1, 2007, he was rated as the most successful minister in the Croatian Government with 31% approval rate. Primorac was at first not a member of a political party, before he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in September 2007. At the Croatian parliamentary election, 2007, he ran as a candidate of HDZ in the 11th electoral unit (the so-called Croatian diaspora list), and their list won almost 82% of the votes. After elections he did not join the Parliament and was named a minister again in January 2008. Because of proposed reduction of the budget for the Ministry of education, science and sports, and especially due to the canceling the project of free textbooks and free transport for pupils of primary and secondary schools in Croatia he announced his resignation. He resigned on July 7, 2009. Soon after, he made an unprecedented move, and he gave up his seat in the Croatian parliament to the Party. The Party then gave the seat to Goran Maric, who replaced Primorac while he was minister. On November 9, 2009, Primorac formally announced his candidacy in the Croatian presidential election, 2009. He was subsequently summarily removed from HDZ membership. In the first round of the election he won 5.93% of the vote and did not qualify for the second round."

  "text" : "Sir Arthur Douglas Dodds-Parker (5 July 1909 – 13 September 2006) was, successively, an imperial administrator, a wartime soldier involved in irregular warfare, and British Conservative Party politician. Between the wars, he served in the Sudan, in the prestigious Sudan Political Service. Once the war broke out, he joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE), but was returned to the Sudan to serve in the famous Gideon Force during the liberation of Ethiopia. After the East African Campaign, he served on SOE's planning staff in London, before taking command roles in the Mediterranean Theatre. In political life, he served twice as a Member of Parliament (MP). He was MP for Banbury from 1945 to 1959, holding three junior ministerial positions from 1953 to 1957. In particular, he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs through the Suez Crisis in 1956. Unlike Sir Anthony Nutting, who resigned as Minister of State at the Foreign Office, Dodds-Parker considered it his duty to remain in office even though he did not support the plan for Britain and France to invade Egypt under the pretext of separating the Egyptians from a prearranged invasion by Israel; he was, however, sacked from government in the following year. He stood down from his seat in the House of Commons in 1959, but returned to Parliament as MP for Cheltenham from 1964 to 1974."

  "text" : "David Brooks (1756 – August 30, 1838) was an officer in the Continental Army in the American Revolution and a United States representative from New York. Brooks was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and attended the public schools there. In 1776, he entered the Continental Army as a lieutenant. He was captured at Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. He was a prisoner-of-war for over three years, finally being exchanged in January 1780. As a parolee, he was not allowed in combat again, so he was appointed assistant clothier general. During the 1780s, Brooks studied law, was admitted to the bar, and began practicing law. He was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati upon its founding in 1783. He moved to New York County, New York (modern day Manhattan) and was a member of the New York state assembly from 1787 to 1788. Brooks then moved to Dutchess County, New York and again was a member of the New York state assembly from 1794 to 1796. In 1795, Brooks was also made a judge of Dutchess County, a job he would keep until 1807 in spite of the fact that, at various times, he would be concurrently a state or federal legislator or a federal officer. In 1796, Brooks was elected to the House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1797 to March 4, 1799. He ran failed campaigns for reelection in 1798 and 1800. In the 19th century, Brooks was appointed as a commissioner to negotiate a treaty with the Seneca people. In 1807, Brooks finally left his job as judge of Dutchess County to become clerk of Dutchess County, a job he held from June 5, 1807, to January 25, 1809, from February 9, 1810, to February 11, 1811, and again from February 23, 1813, to February 13, 1815. Brooks was also served on the New York state assembly again in 1810. Brooks was later appointed an officer in the United States Custom Service. He died in Poughkeepsie, New York on August 30, 1838."

The park's clubhouse was renamed the Dorian Parker Centre in her honour in 2001. She remained active in local politics after her retirement, leading a campaign to oppose a city plan to build a water reservoir and pumping station in Sunnidale Park.

Mohan Lal, a cloth merchant from Bhopal, also had the nickname of Dharti Pakad for contesting elections against five different Prime Ministers and losing the deposit in all these elections. Nagarmal Bajoria is also known by the nickname of Dharti Pakad; he contested from over 278 constituencies and used donkeys for campaigning in an election. There are others who have contested several elections (see this for example) unsuccessfully, but not necessarily known by the sobriquet. Dharti Pakad is also a popular nickname in office politics referring to individuals who have no case for meaningful existence in the prevailing environment."

  "text" : "Dmitry Ivanovich Sanakoyev (born 10 May 1969 in Tskhinvali, South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast, Georgian SSR, Soviet Union) is a South Ossetian and Georgian politician, a former official in the secessionist government of South Ossetia and currently Head of the Provisional Administration of South Ossetia, a rival entity established in 2007 in the Georgian-controlled territories of this separatist region. Sanakoyev was born in Tskhinvali, in what was then the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast of the Georgian SSR. He graduated from the South Ossetian Pedagogical State Institute in 1993, and served as a Soviet army officer in Lithuania from 1987 to 1989. In the 1991-1992 war between Georgian forces and secessionist militias he fought on the Ossetian side. In 1993-1996 worked in the South Ossetian de facto defence ministry. In 1996 he was appointed defence minister and in 1998 vice prime minister. In July 2001 he became prime minister of South Ossetia, serving until December 2001, when Eduard Kokoity replaced Lyudvig Chibirov as South Ossetia’s leader. During the South Ossetian presidential elections, 2006, on November 13, in a so-called \"alternative\" poll organized by The Salvation Union of South Ossetia in Georgian- and Ossetian villages not controlled by the separatists, Sanakoyev was declared the president-elect, with more than 80 percent of the vote. His campaign posters were prominently posted on walls outside polling stations in Georgian-controlled villages, and benefited from extensive media coverage in the Georgian press. His election manifesto envisaged the restoration of the region's status as an autonomous republic within Georgia and a program of measures to spur economic growth. At a press conference on November 13, 2006, Kokoity termed Sanakoyev and Karkusov, head of the alternative election commission and a former adviser to Kokoity, \"traitors to their homeland and traitors to the South Ossetian people.\" The South Ossetian media launched a campaign to discredit and compromise Sanakoyev, accusing him of corruption, duplicity, and collaborating with Georgian intelligence.In December 2006, Sanakoyev formed a government, choosing not to appoint a defense minister. On May 10, 2007, Sanakoyev was appointed by the President of Georgia as the Head of South Ossetian Provisional Administrative Entity. The next day Sanakoyev addressed the Parliament of Georgia in Ossetic, outlining his vision for a resolution of the conflict in South Ossetia (full text). The move earned praise from the United States State Department, but alarmed the de facto authorities in Tskhinvali, which ordered the blocking of traffic to ethnic Georgian villages and threatened to oust Sanakoyev’s government by force, moves that received the disapproval of the Russian government. On June 26, 2007, Sanakoyev delivered a speech, in his native Ossetian, at the EU-Georgian Parliamentary Cooperation Committee in Brussels, his first appeal to the international community. He emphasized that \"a direct dialogue between the Georgian and Ossetian peoples, and demilitarization of the region, are of crucial importance… The European type of autonomy, like in South Tyrol, can serve as a model… in unified Georgia…. where liberal democracy is being built\". On July 3, 2008, Sanakoyev survived an attack on the convoy he was traveling in when it hit a remote-controlled mine. Both Sanakoyev’s administration and Georgian police officials blamed forces loyal to Kokoity's separatist government of South Ossetia for organizing the incident, but a representative of that government denied any connection with the attack."

  "text" : "Denis Walter Coe (5 June 1929 – 3 March 2015) was a British Labour Party politician. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the marginal Middleton and Prestwich constituency from 1966 to 1970, when it was gained by the Conservative Alan Haselhurst. Coe was born in Whitley Bay, Northumberland. He earned a Scout Silver Medal for Gallantry after saving a young girl from drowning in Cullercoats Bay when he was 14. He served in the armed forces before returning to the North East to begin a career in teaching. He later left the area again to move to London, where he studied economics at the London School of Economics. This triggered his move into politics and he was elected to Middleton and Prestwich as a Labour MP in 1966. Following the 1970 election, Coe worked in the arts world and went on to establish the British Youth Opera. In 2008, he published his memoirs – Variety Certainly Adds Spice."

  "text" : "David Graham Pole (11 December 1877 – 26 November 1952) was a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Derbyshire from 1929 to 1931. His parents were John Pole, a ship's captain, and Rossina Graham, both from Shetland. Pole was an unsuccessful candidate at four times: in East Grinstead at the 1918 general election; at the Edinburgh North by-election in 1920; in Cardiff South 1922 general election; and in Cardiff Central 1924 general election. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Derbyshire at the 1929 general election, but was defeated at the 1931 general election by the Conservative Party candidate Paul Emrys-Evans. Pole did not stand for Parliament again. He died in Marylebone aged 74. Pole was both a Fabian Society and a Theosophical Society activist. As such he defended Annie Besant's taking and retention of Jiddhu Krishnamurti and his brother Nityananda from their Indian magistrate father. Per James Webb, The Occult Underground (Open Court Press, 1974), Pole edited a Theosophical publication Theosophy in Scotland among his many Theosophical endeavors."

Mort, along with the majority of Labour MPs, lost his seat. Mort stood, unsuccessfully, at the 1935 general election in Bilston. He was returned to the House of Commons as MP for Swansea East at an unopposed by-election in 1940, following the death of the Labour MP David Williams.

Creighton came to Canada West with his family in 1855. He became editor and publisher of the Owen Sound Times in 1864, retiring in 1896. In 1873, he married Jane Elizabeth Kramer. He was first elected to the assembly in an 1875 by-election held after the election of Thomas Scott was declared invalid. He helped establish the newspaper The Empire at Toronto, which operated from 1887 to 1895. In 1895, Creighton was appointed assistant Receiver-General at Toronto. The community of Creighton Mine, now a ghost town in Greater Sudbury, was named after him. He died in 1917."

  "text" : "Donald E. Stephens (March 13, 1928 – April 18, 2007) was the first mayor of Rosemont, Illinois, USA, and a leading Illinois Republican politician. Stephens, born in Chicago, is believed to have been the longest-serving mayor in the United States; at the time of his death, he was in the middle of serving his thirteenth consecutive four-year term as mayor of the suburban Cook County village; he almost exceeded the Illinois record for longest-serving mayor, set by Frank Caliper of Colp. He had served as mayor since its incorporation in 1956. Prior to that, he had been the president of the homeowner's association of the neighborhood that later became known as Rosemont. During his tenure, Rosemont grew from a tiny community of only 85 to one of Illinois' most politically important communities, with over 4,000 residents as well as the nation's tenth-largest convention center. Stephens also oversaw the construction of the 18,500 seat Allstate Arena (formerly the Rosemont Horizon) and the Rosemont Theatre. Stephens' political career was dogged by accusations of association with organized crime, which led to the only major political defeat in his career: the revocation of a state-issued casino license for Rosemont. In 1983, Stephens was indicted, in separate prosecutions, for tax fraud and bribery, but was acquitted on both charges. Stephens was also an avid collector of Hummel figurines and established a museum holding his collection in Rosemont. The Donald E. Stephens Museum of Hummels claims to be the largest public display of Hummel figurines in the world. Stephens died in Rosemont on April 18, 2007, of complications of stomach cancer."

  "text" : "Dimitar Yanakiev Vlahov (Bulgarian: Димитър Янакиев Влахов) (1878 in Kukush, Ottoman Empire – 1953 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia) was a politician from the region of Macedonia and member of the left wing of the Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary movement (also known as Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO)). As with many other IMRO members of the time, historians from the Republic of Macedonia consider him an ethnic Macedonian and in Bulgaria he is considered a Bulgarian. Vlahov declared himself until the early 1930s as a Bulgarian and afterwards as an Ethnic Macedonian. However such left Macedonian activists never managed to get rid of their strong Bulgarophile sentiments. He was born in Kukush (present-day Greece) and attended the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. After that he emigrated to the Kingdom of Bulgaria and graduated from secondary school in Belogradtchik. Vlachov also studied chemistry in Germany and Switzerland, where he took part in socialist circles. However, he graduated in these subjects from Sofia University. Here he enrolled in the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party. In 1903, Vlahov entered a military service in an officer's school in Sofia. Then he worked as a teacher in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki where he was active in IMRO. During this period, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities. In 1905, Vlahov was released and went back to Bulgaria where he worked as a teacher in Kazanlak. In 1908, after the Young Turks revolution he began working in the Bulgarian secondary school in Thessaloniki again. In the next few years, Vlahov was politically active as a member of the Ottoman Parliament as a representative from the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). After the dissolution of the PFP in 1911, he became a member the Ottoman Socialist Party and in 1912 was elected again as a deputy in the Ottoman Parliament. After the Balkan Wars, Vlachov was a representative of the Kingdom of Bulgaria in high diplomatic and administrative positions in Odessa, Kiev, Pristina and Vienna. After World War I and the reestablishment of IMRO in 1920, Vlahov was elected as alternate member of its Central Committee, representing the left wing. At that time he was a Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Varna. Todor Alexandrov urged him to establish a contact between IMRO and Soviet Russia. As a messenger served Krastyo Rakovski, his best man and prominent figure of the Comintern. On behalf of IMRO, Vlahov departed in July 1923 to Moscow. So in 1924, IMRO entered negotiations in Vienna with the Comintern about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement and the creation of a united Macedonian movement. Vlahov helped the subscription of the so-called May Manifesto about forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. After the subsequent rift between the organization and the Communists, the new leadership headed by Ivan Mihailov excluded him from the organization and he was sentenced to death. In 1925, he was one of the founders of the IMRO (United) in Vienna. He also became a member of Bulgarian Communist Party. During the late 1920s, he worked in France, Germany and Austria as a Comintern publicist. During this period he was chased by IMRO and against him were organized several failed assassination attempts. In 1932 a members of IMRO (United), put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation in a lecture in Moscow. The question was also studied in the highest institutions of the Comintern and in the autumn of 1933, Dimitar Vlahov arrived in Moscow and took part in a number of meetings. So on January 11, 1934, the Political Secretariat of the Comintern adopted a special Resolution on the Macedonian Question. From 1936 to 1944, Vlahov lived in the Soviet Union and in 1944 he went to the new Yugoslavia with Socialist Republic of Macedonia, where he worked in high state and political positions. In 1948 on a meeting of the Central committee of the Macedonian Communist Party he claimed that the decision by the IMRO (United) from 1932 on the formation of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was a political mistake. Later, he was gradually pushed out of his power positions from the pro-Yugoslav circle around Lazar Kolishevski. Vlahov died in Belgrade in 1953."

Schreck represented the riding of North Vancouver-Lonsdale from 1991 to 1996 for the New Democratic Party of British Columbia. He served as parliamentary secretary to the Premier and to a Minister of Employment and Investment. He won election in 1991 by half a percentage point (less than 500 votes) but lost his seat in the 1996 BC election, by more than 10 per cent of the vote, to Katherine Anne Whittred. Afterwards, Schreck failed to win a councillor's seat for the District of North Vancouver and declared he would not again run in a political election. His term as MLA was his only successful bid after tries in the 1983, 1986, and 1991 provincial elections and the 1984 federal election. He publishes political commentary on his website, StrategicThoughts.com, and appears weekly on Victoria radio station CFAX with host Murray Langdon.His background is in economics. Schreck received a degree in that field from Grinnell College in 1969 and a Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia in 1978. In October 2011, his tweet, \"Is Premier Clark's cleavage revealing attire appropriate for the legislature?\" generated controversy and a reprimand from NDP leader Adrian Dix."

Max Bushby, OBE, a Tasmanian MP and later Speaker of the State House of Assembly. He was educated at the University of Tasmania, where he graduated in economics and law, and the Australian Maritime College, from where he received a diploma in business. Prior to entering parliament, Bushby was a practising lawyer and political adviser. In May 2007, Bushby was preselected for Tasmanian Liberal Senate ticket in the number two position ahead of the 2007 election. Consequently, Bushby appeared destined to enter the federal parliament at the beginning of the next Senate term in July 2008 given the highly electable nature of this position on the ticket. In fact his entry to federal parliament came sooner. On 30 August 2007, Bushby was appointed to the Senate by the Tasmanian parliament to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Paul Calvert."

  "text" : "Sir Richard Dawson Bates, 1st Baronet OBE PC JP DL (23 November 1876 – 10 June 1949), known as Dawson Bates, was an Ulster Unionist Party member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons. He was born in Strandtown, Belfast, the son of Richard Dawson Bates, solicitor and Clerk of the Crown, and Mary Dill. His paternal grandfather, John Bates (d. 1855), had been a minor figure in the Conservative Party in Belfast, before his duties were discharged on a Chancery Court ruling of maladministration. Bates was educated at Coleraine Academical Institution. After studying at Queen's College, Belfast, became a solicitor in 1900, in 1908 founding a firm with his uncle - E and R.D. Bates, later R.B.Uprichard would be apprenticed, become a partner and eventually take over the firm of E and R.D. Bates and Uprichard, as Crown Solicitor. In 1906 Bates was appointed Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council. During this time, he was instrumental in the events of Ulster Day and in the formation of the UVF, organised the Larne gun-running and supported the formation of the Ulster Unionist Labour Association to counter socialism. He toured Northern Ireland, working hard to build up the Unionist Party, while portraying all Roman Catholics as traitors. Bates stood down as Secretary on his election to Stormont in 1921, where he represented first East Belfast and later Belfast Victoria. In the government of Sir James Craig he was the first Minister for Home Affairs and a member of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland. He introduced the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, but opposed the Ulster Protestant Association. Under his administration, he was accused of gerrymandering, and of intervening to ensure that prison sentences were not imposed on Protestants who attacked Catholics. Bates was also a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of County Down. He married Jessie Muriel Cleland, daughter of Sir Charles John Cleland. They had one son, Major Sir John Dawson Bates, 2nd Baronet(an Oxford-educated Wykehamist, d. 1998). He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1919 New Year Honours, Knight Bachelor in 1921 and was made a baronet of Magherabuoy, near Portrush, in County Londonderry on 7 June 1937. In his retirement strained financial circumstances and security (he constantly required a police escort) led him to rent Butleigh House, near Glastonbury, Somerset. It was here he died in 1949; Sir Dawson's body was flown back to Ulster for burial at Ballywillan Church of Ireland. Bates was a director and president of Glentoran Football Club."

In 1689 Knyphausen organized the creation of the efficient Geheime Hofkammer, or collegiate central control office, for Brandenburg-Prussia.

Coming from Kentucky sometime before 1845, Lownsdale established the first tannery near the current location of Providence Park just west of downtown. Tanner Creek, which flowed by the site in the mid-19th century, was named after the tannery. Lownsdale served as a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. Lownsdale purchased the land that would become downtown Portland on September 22, 1848. He resurveyed Portland, keeping the small blocks (200 feet per side, 64 feet streets), and adding the contiguous park blocks. He became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Josiah Lamberson Parrish. Lownsdale would defend the matter in court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858). Lownsdale is buried in the Salem Pioneer Cemetery."

He represented the riding of Eagle River in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from 1989 to 1996 as a member of the Liberal Party. In the 1996 election, Dumaresque defeated Yvonne Jones for the Liberal nomination in the redistricted riding of Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair. Jones ran as an independent candidate, however, and defeated Dumaresque in the general election. She later joined the Liberal caucus. He later served as John Efford's campaign manager in the party's leadership convention in 2001. He subsequently threatened to sue the victorious candidate, Roger Grimes, for libel after Grimes reportedly stated that he \"would never be able to sleep any one night in comfort, knowing he had a minister in confidence who had Danny Dumaresque as an advisor to him.\" He also served as president of the provincial Liberal Party from 2006 until 2009. He was succeeded in this role by Judy Morrow. Dumaresque ran as the Liberal candidate in Torngat Mountains in the 2007 election, but lost to Patty Pottle. He was also frequently rumoured as a possible candidate for the leadership of the provincial Liberal party in their 2010 leadership election. After he had previously stated that he would not rule it out, on July 29, 2010 he announced he would not run and would instead focus on his business career. In March 2011, he announced that he was considering running for the Liberals in the 2011 provincial election in the district of Lake Melville, but on August 22, 2011, he was acclaimed as the party's candidate in The Isles of Notre Dame and lost in the general election. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the leadership election to replace Yvonne Jones in August 2011. On July 2, 2013 Dumaresque announced he was running for the leadership of the provincial Liberal Party in their 2013 election. He was, again, ultimately unsuccessful in his bid to lead the party. Dumaresque ran for the Liberal nomination in Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair for the 2015 provincial election but lost to Lisa Dempster. He was eventually nominated in Conception Bay East – Bell Island, but lost to the Progressive Conservative incumbent, David Brazil."

Warnock worked as a journalist with the Perth Daily News, and as a radio broadcaster with 720 ABC Perth, 6PR and 6NR. She was elected to the State Parliament as the Member for Perth in 1993, succeeding Dr Ian Alexander who had retired. She was re-elected in 1996 but did not contest the February 2001 election. Her political career was entirely from the opposition bench, during the premiership of Richard Court. Warnock served as Opposition whip, spokesperson for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and the Arts and spokesperson for Women's Interests and Racing & Gaming. She also served as President of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. In 1996, Warnock and upper house MP Cheryl Davenport steered a controversial pro-choice bill through the parliament—the \"Acts Amendment (Abortion) Bill\", which effectively decriminalised abortion and enabled women to access abortions of pregnancies up to 20 weeks on the basis of informed consent. In 1999 she was named the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. As of 2013, she is the current patron of the Friends of Perth International Arts Festival. Warnock was married to local novelist, playwright and arts patron Bill Warnock, who died in 2001."

He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was Senior Wrangler in 1777 and received his M.A. degree in 1780. He was ordained a deacon for the Church of England in 1778, served as a chaplain in the Royal Navy and was ordained to the priesthood in 1787. In 1767, with his uncle William Owen and his two brothers, Owen had been granted land on Passamaquoddy Outer Island (renamed Campobello Island in 1770). In 1787, some time after the death of his uncle, Owen came to the island to manage the family's interests. He was named justice of the peace and a judge for the Court of General Sessions and the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. Owen lobbied unsuccessfully to have Campobello Island and several nearby islands declared a separate county from Charlotte. He died on Campobello Island in 1829 and was buried in the family vault in Wales."

  "text" : "Dennis Pennington (May 18, 1776 – September 2, 1854) was a farmer and a stonemason who became known for his many years in public office as an early legislator in the Indiana Territory and in Indiana's General Assembly as a representative of Harrison County, Indiana. Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens."

  "text" : "David Rice Kent (also known as David Ceannt; died November 1930) was an Irish Sinn Féin politician. On 2 May 1916, David Kent, his mother Mrs Rice Kent and three brothers—Thomas, William and Richard—were involved in a gunfight with members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during an arrest operation following the Easter Rising in Dublin. When the supply of ammunition being loaded by Mrs Rice Kent was at its end, Richard attempted to escape but was shot and died from his wounds within several days. Thomas was not charged with armed rebellion but with \"wilful murder\", executed by firing squad and buried in the Detention Barracks. David was transferred to Richmond Barracks in Dublin, where he was sentenced to death, though later was reduced to penal servitude for life. Subsequently he was moved to HM Prison Pentonville in England though released from there within the year.,. David Kent was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin MP for the Cork East constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann, though Kent did not attend. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork East and North East constituency at the 1921 elections. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. He was re-elected for the same constituency at the 1922 general election, this time as an anti-Treaty Sinn Féin TD, and he did not sit in the Dáil from this time onwards. He was elected as a Republican TD for Cork East constituency at the 1923 general election. He was elected as one of five Sinn Féin TDs at the June 1927 general election. He did not contest the September 1927 general election. His brother William Kent was also a TD in the 1920s and 1930s."

  "text" : "Desmond Anderson Harvie Banks, Baron Banks, CBE (23 October 1918 – 15 June 1997) was a British Liberal Party politician. Banks was born in Ascot, Berkshire. He was educated at prep school in Harrow and University College School in Hampstead. During the Second World War he served as an officer in the Royal Artillery. In 1948 he married Barbara Wells who in 1987 was awarded the OBE for services to the Women's Liberal Federation. They had two sons, Alistair Richard Harvie Banks (b. 1951) and Graham Thornton Harvie Banks (b. 1953). Banks was a life insurance broker and pensions consultant. He was Chairman of the Liberal Party Executive from 1961 to 1963 and from 1969 to 1970, and President of the Liberal Party from 1968 to 1969. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for political service in the 1972 New Year Honours. He was created a life peer on 7 January 1975 as Baron Banks, of Kenton in Greater London. In the House of Lords he was Liberal Deputy Chief Whip from 1977to 1983. Banks had joined the Liberals while at school. He joined the staff at Liberal Party HQ in 1949 and was at one time editor of the party newspaper Liberal News. He first stood as a parliamentary candidate in the 1950 election in Harrow East, then in St Ives in 1955 election and Hertfordshire South West in the 1959 election. He was sometime speechwriter for Jo Grimond and a frequent contributor to Liberal News as well as author of many pamphlets and policy papers. In 1952, together with Peter Grafton who had been Liberal parliamentary candidate in Bromley in 1950 in opposition to Harold Macmillan, Banks co-founded the Radical Reform Group, a social liberal pressure group within the Liberal Party to prevent what many saw as a rightward drift by the party, and its potential capture by the economic liberals. The Group campaigned under the slogan 'social reform without socialism'. Banks was a strong pro-European, a founder member and one time chairman of the Liberal European Action Group and was President of the British Council of the European Movement from 1986 to 1994."

  "text" : "Declan James Ganley (born 23 July 1968) is an Irish entrepreneur, businessman, and political activist. Primarily a telecommunications entrepreneur, he has built businesses across Europe, Russia, and latterly, the United States. He is currently the Chairman and CEO of Rivada Networks, a telecommunications company specialising in the efficient use and arbitrage of wireless spectrum. Rivada patented groundbreaking technologies in the field of Dynamic Spectrum Arbitrage. In 2013, Ganley testified to the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce (YouTube) that Rivada's patents had the potential to \"save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars\". He founded and sold successful companies in forestry, and the online sector. During the 2008 Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, Ganley and the Libertas Institute successfully campaigned for a No vote. He again campaigned for a \"No\" vote in the 2012 Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum. Aside from this, he has guest-presented Tonight with Vincent Browne. In 2009, he was founder and chairman of a political party, Libertas with pan-European ambitions. The party was unsuccessful in this ambition in the 2009 European Parliament Election, succeeding in getting only one candidate elected, in France. Ganley was upbeat after the defeat, describing the venture as a \"failed experiment\". His first book, The Fight for Democracy, was published in 2009. He was one of the contributors, along with Joseph Stiglitz and others, of the book What If Ireland Defaults, a collection of essays on the response to the Irish economic crisis."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with the Canadian businessman and politician Donald MacInnes.) Donald MacInnis (21 August 1918 – 9 May 2007) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the House of Commons of Canada. He was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia and became a coal miner by career. He was first elected at the Cape Breton South riding in the 1957 general election, defeating the long-serving incumbent Co-operative Commonwealth Federation member of parliament Clarence Gillis, also a former miner. MacInnis defeated Gillis again in a rematch almost a year later in the 1958 general election, known as the \"Diefenbaker Sweep.\" MacInnis remained a Member of Parliament throughout the 1960s and early 1970s except for the 25th Parliament when he was defeated in the riding by Malcolm Vic MacInnis of the New Democratic Party in the 1962 election. Since the 1968 election, MacInnis represented Cape Breton—East Richmond, one of the ridings which replaced the Cape Breton South electoral district in a boundary realignment. After his term in the 29th Parliament ended in 1974, MacInnis left national office and did not campaign for another term. From 1988, MacInnis served as the final Mayor of Glace Bay, a municipality which was dissolved in 1995 and replaced by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality."

He was born in Yuncheng District, Yunfu, Guangdong, and participated in the Canton–Hong Kong strike and the Guangzhou Uprising in his youth. He later engaged in underground work in Guangzhou and Hong Kong for the CCP, and become Party Committee Secretary of Guangzhou and Hong Kong and head of the Organisation Department in Guangdong. After 1931, he was active in the Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet and worked as the Party Committee Secretary of Fujian, and head of the State Political Security Bureau. He later assisted in the war, becoming the Political Director of the Shaan-Gan Army's 3rd Column, in charge of the secret police. His handling of the position earned him the nickname of China's Dzerzhinsky; he was present in the Long March. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was appointed representative of the CCP to Xinjiang, and among other positions, became the fifth president of the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the highest training center for party workers and leaders. Deng served as principal from 1939 to 1942. He died in a plane crash in 1946, along with other senior Communist leaders including Ye Ting, Bo Gu, and Wang Ruofei."

  "text" : "Deborah L. Ruggiero (born April 2, 1958), commonly known as Deb Ruggiero, is an American radio personality and politician from Jamestown, Rhode Island. A Democrat, she serves in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, representing the 74th district, which contains all of Jamestown and part of Middletown. Ruggiero was first elected in November 2008 and took office on January 6, 2009. In 2008, Ruggiero challenged 28-year incumbent Bruce J. Long (R–Middletown) for the 74th district seat. Long, a Republican, was the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives and was seeking his fifteenth term. In the election held on November 4, 2008, Ruggiero defeated Long by 54% to 46%, carrying each of the district's six precincts. She was re-elected in 2010, winning 53% in a three-way race. Her Republican and Independent opponents took 31% and 16% of the vote respectively. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Ruggiero went to high school in Lincoln, Rhode Island before attending Boston College, graduating magna cum laude with a double major in English and Communications. She has spent her career in the media, working first for CBS radio in Boston, then for FOX TV and WPRI-TV for 8 years. Since 2000, she has served as Director of Community and Business Development at Citadel Radio, the owners of WPRO and WPRO-FM. Since 1992, she has also taught a class in Broadcast Advertising at Providence College. A supporter of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Ruggiero attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver as an alternate. Ruggiero is lesbian; her partner of 22 and a half years, Joyce Ioanes, died of cancer in 2007. She is one of four openly LGBT members of the Rhode Island General Assembly, alongside Rep. Gordon D. Fox (D–Providence), Rep. Frank Ferri (D–Warwick) and Sen. Donna Nesselbush (D–Pawtucket)."

She first won election to the House of Representatives in 1978, and served in the body until 1998. Long was elected as the first female Speaker of the House in 1992. Her tenure in that position was cut short due to the \"Phonegate\" scandal, in which members of the House of Representatives were found to be using state toll-free access codes for personal use. Long resigned the speakership in September 1993, but continued to serve until 1998, becoming the first woman to chair the House Tax Committee. After leaving the legislature, Long lobbied for energy independence, before retiring in 2007. She lives in Minnetonka, Minnesota."

  "text" : "David M. Jennings (born December 17, 1948) is a former Minnesota politician, a former member of the Republican Party, a former Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and the former superintendent of Eastern Carver County School District 112, based in Chaska. Jennings served in the United States Marine Corps for five years and was honorably discharged with the rank of staff-sergeant in December 1972. He received a B.S. degree in political science, magna cum laude, from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 1976. He worked in small construction and as a Congressional staff aide until he was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1978. Jennings rose quickly, becoming minority leader in February 1982. He served in that role until the Independent-Republicans gained a majority in the 1984 elections. He became Speaker of the House in January 1985, a position he held for two years until his departure from the legislature. Beginning in 1990, Jennings was employed as a corporate executive for Schwan's Food Co., based in Marshall, Minnesota, leaving there in December 1998. In 1999, Jennings served briefly as Minnesota's Commissioner of Commerce under Governor Jesse Ventura, after which he became CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce. In January 2002, Jennings became Chief Operating Officer of the Minneapolis Public Schools and later served as interim superintendent of the Minneapolis school district from October 2003 to June 2004. He was considered for permanent appointment, but withdrew from consideration after the appointment process was criticized. He went on to serve as deputy director of operations for the Minnesota Historical Society for one year, before accepting a permanent appointment as superintendent of schools for the Eastern Carver County School District, based in Chaska in July 2005. He is married and has one son."

  "text" : "Dan H. Branch (born March 5, 1958) is a former member of the Texas House of Representatives from Dallas, Texas, U.S.A. First elected in 2002, as a Republican, Branch completed his sixth term in  District 108, which includes Downtown, Uptown, Historic East Dallas, Greenland Hills, Lower Greenville, The Village, as well as the town of Highland Park and the city of University Park. On July 25, 2013, Branch officially announced his candidacy  for state attorney general in the 2014 Republican primary election. Branch finished second in the primary to State Senator Ken Paxton of McKinney, but because no candidate secured a majority vote, the two met in the May 27 runoff election, where Branch lost. Paxton led the primary field with 566,114 votes (44.4 percent); Branch followed with 426,595 votes (33.5 percent). Eliminated in the primary was Texas Railroad Commissioner Barry Smitherman of Austin, who polled the remaining 281,064 (22.1 percent).Ken Paxton defeated Branch in the Republican runoff by a 26% margin and was elected easily in the general election as the next Attorney General."

  "text" : "Daniel C. Itse, known as Dan Itse (born May 21, 1958), is a conservative Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. A native of San Francisco, California, Itse is a professional engineer who resides in Fremont, New Hampshire. He advocates the revival of state sovereignty in an era of otherwise expanded government through the revival of the 1798 Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively, to permit the empowerment of individual states within the federal Union. Itse has explained his proposition on the national Glenn Beck interview program on Fox news. Itse's resolution in the New Hampshire legislature inspired other state legislatures to do the same (possibly as many as 20.) When he was eight years old, Itse moved with his family to Sherborn, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1976 from Dover-Sherborn High School. and then enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, from which in 1980 he procured a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering. He earned a master of science in the same field in 1986, also from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He is a registered professional engineer in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. From 1979-1989, he worked for the Riley Stoker Corporation. He was chief engineer of Physical Sciences, Inc., from 1989-1994. Since 1994, he has owned Christofferson Engineering. An inventor, Itse holds patents on (1) a low-emissions burner for coal-fired power plants, (2) a low-emissions combustion system for waste-to-energy, (3) a process for disposing of heavy metals, and (4) a device to enhance the injection of chemicals for reducing pollution from power plants. In 2009, Itse was working on the air pollution control system for the largest wood-fired power plant in North America. Since 2001, Itse has represented Rockingham County, which is located in the southeastern corner of the state, in the legislature, which meets in the capital city of Concord. He has served on the Children and Family Law and the Science, Technology and Energy committees. He once had the best attendance record in the legislature. He claims to vote in all cases in accordance with a literal reading of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, and personal liberty and property. In the 2011/2012 term he was the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification. In that term he saw the creation of the Committee on Redress of Grievances Chaired by Rep. Paul Ingbretson. The peoples right of redress as a positive right in New Hampshire was brought to light as a result of his commentary on the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, \"The People's Liberty\". An advocate of judicial reform, Itse supports constitutional amendments regarding the recognition of marriage, parental rights, prohibiting a state income tax, and affirming the right to petition the legislature for redress of grievances. He is a nationally prominent advocate of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the assertion of state sovereignty.Though his sovereignty amendment was rejected by his New Hampshire colleagues, it inspired similar proposals in some twenty states as well as the \"Tea Party\" demonstrations in April 2009. In 1979, while he was a senior in college, Itse married the former Lisa Mullins. The couple has five children, born between 1983 and 1995. The youngest, Jarrod, is handicapped. In the 2008 Republican presidential contest, Itse was a supporter of U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado. Itse is scheduled to address the national committee meeting of the Constitution Party to be held June 11–13 in Newark, New Jersey. In 2014 Itse authored \"States Have Powers - the Powers of the People, use 'em or lose 'em\" (available on Amazon). The book is an expository on his 2012 sovereignty resolution. It explains why the People are in fact in supreme power in America, and the intended distribution of power between the government of the United States and the States and between the three branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial. At their 2015 Liberty Dinner, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance revealed that Itse was chosen as legislator of the year."

While in India he was a passionate amateur photographer. He experimented freely and produced semi-abstract images. At the 1880 general election Macfarlane was elected as a Home Rule Member of Parliament for Carlow County. The Carlow constituency lost one of its two seats under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and at the 1885 general election Macfarlane stood instead for the Crofters Party in Argyllshire. He won the seat, but lost it in 1886. He was re-elected (by a narrow margin) at the 1892 general elections as a Liberal/Crofters candidate, holding it until a further defeat in 1895. He was knighted in 1894. Macfarlane married Mary Isabella Bagshawe in 1857"

  "text" : "Denise Margaret Allen (born 29 March 1953) is a former Australian politician, political strategist, social/political commentator and disability advocate. Born in Alexandra, Victoria to Jack Donald and Bette Doreen Boote, she attended local public schools before graduating in 1970. Prior to entering politics Denise was a life skills/motivational tutor. She also owned a modelling agency, beauty therapy studio and retail fashion store. In 2000, she was the Labor Party candidate for the by-election for Benalla in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, which was being vacated by former Deputy Premier and state Nationals leader Pat McNamara. On paper, Allen faced daunting odds. Benalla was a staunchly conservative seat in rural northeastern Victoria, and had been in National hands for all but nine years since 1920. However, she won a surprise victory over new Nationals candidate Bill Sykes, winning by only 237 votes. She was the first Labor member ever to win it. A Buddhist, she was the inaugural chairperson of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet. In the 2002 state election, she was defeated by Sykes in a rematch despite Labor being reelected in a massive landslide Although Allen led on the primary vote, she was defeated on the third count after Liberal candidate Andrew Dwyer's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Sykes. She was a People Power candidate for the Victorian Legislative Council in 2006, contesting Northern Victoria Region unsuccessfully."

He represented Nanaimo from 1986 to 2001 in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a member of the NDP. He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was educated at the University of British Columbia and Carleton University. Lovick was an instructor at Malaspina College in Nanaimo, where he was also head of the English department. At the time of his first election, Nanaimo was a dual-member district, and Lovick served alongside Dave Stupich; Stupich resigned in 1988 and was succeeded in a by-election by Jan Pullinger, whom Lovick would later marry. When the province's electoral districts were realigned into single member districts for the 1991 election, Lovick continued to represent Nanaimo, while Pullinger moved to the new neighbouring district of Cowichan-Ladysmith. Lovick was speaker for the British Columbia assembly from 1996 to 1998. He served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Labour and Minister of Aboriginal Affairs from 1998 to 1999, as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs from 1999 to 2000. He was also government whip from 2000 to 2001. Lovick was the editor of Tommy Douglas Speaks (ISBN 0889820228), published in 1979, and was a contributor to The Canadian Encyclopedia. In 2004, he was named to the board of directors for the Nanaimo Area Land Trust."

  "text" : "David R. Malpass (born March 8, 1956) is an American economist and also ran in the 2010 Republican primary for U.S. Senate in New York. He is the founder and president of Encima Global LLC, an economic research and consulting firm based in New York City. He served as Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary under President Ronald Reagan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under President George H. W. Bush, and Chief Economist at Bear Stearns. During the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Malpass worked on an array of economic, budget, and foreign policy issues including small business promotion throughout Latin America, and the 1986 tax cut. Malpass served as the Republican staff director of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee from 1989–1990, and, more recently, as a member of Congress’s blue-ribbon panel on budget scoring from 2002-2003. Malpass worked at Bear Stearns for 15 years, with six of those years as the firm's chief economist. Malpass' team ranked second in the Institutional Investor ranking of Wall Street economists in 2005, 2006, and 2007. However, the next year, Bear Stearns failed under Malpass's economic guidance and his erroneous assessment of the economy. As investor losses mounted in the mortgage-backed securities markets in 2006 and 2007, the company actually increased its exposure, especially in the mortgage-backed assets that were central to the subprime mortgage crisis. Malpass founded Encima Global in June 2008. The firm provides daily in-depth analysis of global economic and political trends relevant to institutional investors. Malpass authors a column in Forbes magazine and is a regular contributor to the op-ed section of The Wall Street Journal. He is also a frequent TV commentator. From 1977 to 1983 Malpass worked in Portland Oregon for Esco Corporation (steel), Arthur Andersen's systems consulting group (where he became a licensed CPA), and Consolidated Supply (plumbing wholesaler.) In 2012, he wrote a chapter entitled 'Sound Money, Sound Policy' in The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center. Malpass sits on the boards of UBS Funds, The New Mountain Financial Corporation, The Manhattan Institute, and The Gary Klinsky Children's Center. He is also a former director of The National Committee on United States-China Relations, The Council of the Americas, and The Economic Club of New York. On August 5, 2016, Malpass was named a senior economic advisor to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump."

During the War, Fisher was promoted to a full first sergeant. Fisher came to Ashland in 1867 and operated a sawmill and lumberyard at the foot of 17th Street. He had his men cut ice from the Ohio River that winter, when it froze over, packed it in sawdust and dispensed it to Ashland residents, who made ice-houses for storage. He was also a contractor and house-builder, operated a livery stable on Greenup Avenue, opened and operated the first dime store in the city, served as a conductor on the A. C. & I. Railroad, and was overseer of a poor house. The 1880 Census lists David as living with his wife, Mary Anne, and children Edwin, Nellie, Harlan, and Raymond. By 1900, David had been married to a Trescot Fisher (\"Trescot\" was possibly a maiden name) of Ohio for thirty-two years, and was living with his children, Nellie and Raymond Fisher."

Born in Augusta County, Virginia, in 1750, Campbell rose to the rank of major while serving in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. In about 1783, sometime after the war had ended, he moved to Greene County, Tennessee, where he began practicing law. In 1785 he was elected Judge of the Superior Court of the State of Franklin. In 1787 he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly and shortly thereafter was elected judge of the Superior Court of North Carolina, Washington District, a post he served in until 1790, when he was appointed to be a territorial state judge in the Southwest Territory by Governor William Blount. From 1797 until 1809 he served as a justice on the Superior Court of Tennessee, where he was twice impeached. His first impeachment came in 1798 during a dispute with Blount (who had himself just been impeached from the United States Senate), involving the Treaty of Holston; Campbell escaped conviction by one vote. Campbell was impeached again in 1803, having been charged with bribery, but was once again acquitted. Campbell died in Washington, Rhea County, Tennessee, in 1812."

Morgan was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for bravery at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, earning him the nickname \"Dai Alphabet\" in South Wales."

A Democrat, she was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives representing the 2nd Franklin district from 2011 to 2015. The 2nd Franklin district comprises twelve communities, Athol, Belchertown precinct A, Erving, Gill, New Salem, Orange, Petersham, Phillipston, Royalston, Templeton, Warwick, and Wendell. Andrews, who is gay, was born in Orange and still lives there with her partner Candi Fetzer. Andrews earned a bachelor's degree from UMass Amherst and an MBA from Xavier University before embarking on a 25-year career with Procter & Gamble (P&G). Her first P&G positions were in Quincy, Massachusetts and she later moved to the company's headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. She left P&G in 2006 after four years as the company's global diversity & inclusion manager. She then established her own consulting business, Legacy Unlimited. Following incumbent state representative Chris Donelan's announcement that he would run for Franklin County sheriff rather than seek re-election in 2010, Andrews launched a bid to succeed him in the state house. In the Democratic primary election held on September 14, 2010, Andrews polled 37% in a five candidate race, finishing 519 votes ahead of the second-place finisher, who took 24%. In the general election held on November 2, she polled 6,885 (53%), finishing over 1,300 votes ahead of the Republican nominee (who took 42%) and an independent (on 5%). She first took office on January 5, 2011. She was defeated for re-election by Republican Susannah Whipps Lee in November 2014; her term will end January 7, 2015."

In the late 1880s, O'Connor moved to Sudbury where he became associated with economy, life and industry, becoming the town's second mayor in 1894. Later, O'Connor travelled north where he founded the town of Temagami and opened Lady Evelyn Hotel, the Temagami Inn and Ronnoco Hotel. When O'Connor moved to Temagami, he was hoping to find some mineral prospects. In 1899, O'Connor created test pits in east-central Strathy Township that later became Big Dan Mine, which is named after him. Other mines in Temagami that bare his name are Little Dan at Arsenic Lake and O'Connor near Lake Temagami. O'Connor continued to move northwards where he discovered deposits of gold. On March 30, 1933, O'Connor died in the city of Timmins where he was living with his family. The cause of his death was bronchopneumonia."

She was born Dorothy Gretchen Biersteker in Amsterdam and was educated there, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree from Leiden University. During World War I, she was legal adviser to a Dutch government rationing bureau. She married Rufus Palmer Steeves, an officer in the Canadian Army, and came to Vancouver, British Columbia in January 1919. Steeves was a founding member of the CCF. She ran unsuccessfully as a CCF candidate in the provincial riding of Vancouver-Point Grey in the 1933 general election. Steeves was first elected to the provincial assembly in a 1934 by-election held following the death of Harley Christian Erskine Anderson. She was reelected twice and then defeated when she ran for reelection in 1945. Steeves went on to serve in CCF executives at the provincial and federal levels. She ran unsuccessfully as a CCF candidate in the federal riding of Burnaby—Richmond in 1949 and as an NDP candidate in the federal riding of Vancouver Quadra in 1963. Her interests included civil liberties, international affairs, nuclear disarmament, protection of animals, women's issues and abolition of capital punishment. Steeves wrote The Compassionate Rebel : Ernest E. Winch and his times, published in 1960, and Builders and Rebels : A short History of the CCF from 1932 to 1961."

  "text" : "Jones, known by his nickname of \"Denny,\" was born September 21, 1910 in rural Morrow County, Oregon in a house on a wheat farm located between the towns of Ione and Heppner. His family moved briefly to the state of Montana before returning to Wheeler County in Eastern Oregon, where Jones attended public school in the small town of Spray. Jones' mother died when he was just 5 years old. Following his mother's death, his father moved the family to Crook County, where Jones attended school at Prineville. He completed two years of school at Crook County High School before being pulled out by his father, who had designs on making his diminutive son into a professional racing jockey. Jones spent over a year riding horses throughout British Columbia, Canada and in Tijuana, Mexico before he began to gain too much weight, making a further career in horse racing impossible. Jones returned to rural Malheur County, Oregon where he took a job on a cattle ranch. He would remain a ranch hand and rancher for the rest of his working life. In 1939, Jones went into a business partnership with a cousin who owned two cattle ranches, one near the small Oregon town of Jonesboro and the other in close proximity to Juntura. Jones managed the Jonesburo operation for the next ten years before ultimately buying the operation, on which he ran 400 head of cattle. Jones' ranch would ultimately grow to 550 head of cattle contained on 23,000 acres of high desert rangeland. Jones ran the ranch for the next 30 years, serving twice during this time as president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association (OCA). In this capacity Jones gained his first legislative experience engaging in political lobbying on behalf of the interests of the OCA."

In 1961, Ladd was appointed to lead the U.S. Patent Office by President John F. Kennedy. At age 35, he was the second youngest man to ever hold the position. As Commissioner of Patents, Ladd led a comprehensive reorganization of the Office and was present during the Office's 125th anniversary and granting of patent number 3,000,000. In 1980, Ladd succeeded Barbara Ringer as U.S. Register of Copyrights. Like Ringer, Ladd was seen as a strong advocate for authors' rights, and he adopted the position that the Copyright Office should play an active role in favor of copyright protection in public policy discussions. Ladd was succeeded by Donald Curran in 1985 and returned to private practice at Wiley, Rein & Fielding. He retired in 1987 and died in his home in Alexandria, Virginia in 1994, survived by his wife."

  "text" : "Dempster Henry Ratcliffe Heming (November 30, 1885 – April 20, 1967) was an English-born political figure in Saskatchewan. He represented Moose Jaw City from 1944 to 1960 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) member. He was born in London and was educated at Westminster School and King's College London. Heming came to Canada in 1905, settling on a homestead near Arcola, Saskatchewan. He was also working for the Canadian Pacific Railway at the same time and sold his farm in 1912 to become a full-time employee of the railway at Moose Jaw. He helped organize the Labour Representative League there in 1916, which led to the election of William George Baker to the provincial assembly in 1921. Heming was elected to Moose Jaw City Council in 1937, serving until 1947. He retired from politics in 1960. Heming died in Moose Jaw at the age of 81."

  "text" : "Richard Edward Victor \"Dick\" Sutton (March 31, 1901 - 1982) was a Canadian politician, who represented York--Scarborough in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1955 to 1963 as a Progressive Conservative member. Sutton was born in Lindsay, Ontario to James L. Lindsay and Lila Edwards. Sutton was elected in the newly created riding of York--Scarborough which comprised all of the then Borough of Scarborough, Ontario. The population of the borough increased so much, between 1955 and 1963, that it was further subdivided in four ridings for the 1967 provincial general election, making Sutton the only MPP to ever represent the riding. He served as a backbench member of a succession of PC majority governments led by Premiers Leslie Frost and then John Robarts. Despite his lengthy time in office, Lewis did not serve in Cabinet, but he was a member of up to ten Standing Committees of the Legislative Assembly, simultaneously, with a particular interest in committees dealing with municipal law, agriculture, education and conservation. Sutton was married, in 1943, to Margherita May Hodgson (1900 - 1985), who, in turn, was related to three other Members of Provincial Parliament, Ronald Glen Hodgson, Louis Hodgson and Chris Hodgson."

Thomas studied journalism at the University of Toronto, and worked as an arts reporter at the Toronto Star before marrying film director Ralph Thomas. As a resident of The Beaches, she became an activist in the campaign against the Scarborough Expressway, and ran for municipal office in the 1972 election, defeating incumbent councillor Tom Wardle. She was one of several progressive reform candidates, including Elizabeth Eayrs, Michael Goldrick, Colin Vaughan, Dan Heap, Karl Jaffary, Reid Scott, John Sewell and Anne Johnston, who were elected alongside mayor David Crombie. Thomas was re-elected in the 1974 election, but was defeated in the 1976 election by Tom Wardle, Jr., the son of the councillor she had defeated in 1972. She ran again in the 1980 election, defeating Wardle, and served until the 1985 election, when she was defeated by Paul Christie. Thomas and council colleague Dale Martin made national headlines in 1985 when, while attending a Federation of Canadian Municipalities conference in Calgary, they got into a war of words with Calgary mayor Ralph Klein about how ugly and poorly planned they perceived the city to be; Thomas was also quoted as calling Calgary City Hall an \"abomination\". Both Thomas and Martin later apologized for the comments. Following her electoral defeat, Thomas was appointed head of Metro Toronto's licensing commission, and continued to serve on the Toronto Licensing Commission until 2003. In 1996, she coauthored a report investigating problems with the city's process for licensing taxis. She also remained an active member of the New Democratic Party. Thomas died of cancer on May 9, 2005."

  "text" : "Dorothy Mary Wyatt, née Fanning (1925 - 2001) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from 1973 to 1981. She was the city's first female mayor. Wyatt first worked as a secretary, meeting her husband Donald Wyatt while working for American Overseas Airlines in Gander. She later returned to Memorial University of Newfoundland to study nursing. Wyatt first won election to St. John's City Council in 1969 as the city's first female alderman. She ran for the mayoralty in 1973, winning the election and serving two terms in office. Her term as mayor was marked by accomplishments including the city's hosting of the Canada Summer Games in 1977, a shift from rental-value to capital-value municipal tax assessment, the adoption of a ward system for city council elections, and the construction of many of the city's modern office buildings. Wyatt was defeated by John Joseph Murphy in the 1981 election. She was later reelected as a councillor at large in 1985, and remained a sitting member of city council until her death; she died just two days before the city's 2001 municipal election, and was posthumously reelected to her seat on September 25. A by-election was held on November 27 of that year, and was won by Sandy Hickman. She was a candidate for provincial office twice, running as an independent candidate in St. John's Centre and later for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in the party's 1979 leadership convention. In the PC race, she garnered no votes (she didn't even vote for herself, admitting that she had run more \"to shake things up\" than out of a serious desire to actually lead the party) and was eliminated on the first ballot. Wyatt revelled in a quirky and offbeat public image, once telling a reporter that she hoped to be classified \"as a freak, I suppose\"."
