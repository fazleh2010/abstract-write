  "text" : "Cato the Elder (Latin: Cato Major; 234 BC – 149 BC), born Marcus Porcius Cato and also known as Cato the Censor (Cato Censorius), Cato the Wise (Cato Sapiens), and Cato the Ancient (Cato Priscus), was a Roman senator and historian known for his conservatism and opposition to Hellenization. He was the first to write history in Latin. He came of an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), junior consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to preserve Rome's ancestral customs and combat \"degenerate\" Hellenistic influences. His epithet \"Elder\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar."

  "text" : "Charles Stewart Parnell (Irish: Cathal Stiúbhard Parnell; 27 June 1846 – 6 October 1891) was an Irish nationalist politician and one of the most powerful figures in the British House of Commons in the 1880s. Born into a wealthy and powerful Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning family, he entered the House of Commons in 1875. He was a land reform agitator, and became leader of the Home Rule League in 1880, insisting on operating independently of the Liberals, and winning great influence by his balancing of constitutional, radical, and economic issues, and by his skillful use of parliamentary procedure. He was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol in 1882 but, a very capable negotiator, was released when he renounced violent extra-Parliamentary action. That same year he reformed the Home Rule League as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which he controlled minutely as Britain's first disciplined democratic party. The hung Parliament of 1885 saw him hold the balance of power between William Gladstone's Liberals and Lord Salisbury's Conservatives. His power was one factor in Gladstone's adoption of Home Rule as the central tenet of the Liberal Party. His reputation peaked in 1889-90 when letters published in The Times linking him to the Phoenix Park murders of 1882 were shown to have been forged by Richard Pigott. However, the Irish Parliamentary Party split in 1890 after the revelation of Parnell's long adulterous love affair, causing many English Liberals (many of them nonconformists) to refuse to work with him, and strong opposition from Catholic bishops. He headed a small minority faction until his death in 1891. Gladstone described him as: \"I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon.\" Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A.J.P. Taylor says, \"More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation.\""

  "text" : "Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (8 August 1605 – 30 November 1675), was the first Proprietor and Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland, and ninth Proprietary Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland and the colony of Avalon (in the southeast). His title was \"Cecil Calvert, Second Baron Baltimore, First Lord Proprietary, Earl Palatine of the Provinces of Maryland and Avalon in America\". He received the proprietorship after the death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (15 April 1632), for whom it had been intended. Cecil Calvert established and managed the Province of Maryland from his home, Kiplin Hall, in North Yorkshire, England. As an English Roman Catholic, he continued the legacy of his father by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. Maryland became a haven for Catholics in the New World, particularly important at a time of religious persecution in England. Calvert governed Maryland for forty-two years. He also continued to be Lord Proprietor and Governor of Newfoundland for the colony of Avalon. He died in England on 30 November 1675, aged 70 years. He is thought to be buried at St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London, UK. The exact location of his grave is unknown, but parish records state he is buried there. A plaque commemorating Cecil Calvert was placed in St. Giles in 1996 by the Governor of Maryland. However, genealogists for Kiplin Hall state, \"A number of the early Calverts were buried at St Giles in the Fields, Charing Cross Road, London. We cannot yet be certain whether Cecil is one of them.\" This is possibly due to poor record keeping of Catholic burials or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers ."

  "text" : "Charles Wendell \"Chuck\" Colson (October 16, 1931 – April 21, 2012) was an Evangelical Christian leader who founded Prison Fellowship and BreakPoint. Prior to his conversion to Christianity, he served as Special Counsel to President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1973. Once known as President Nixon's \"hatchet man,\" Colson gained notoriety at the height of the Watergate scandal, for being named as one of the Watergate Seven, and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974, he served seven months in the federal Maxwell Prison in Alabama as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges. Colson became a Christian in 1973. His mid-life conversion to Christianity sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry Prison Fellowship and to a focus on Christian worldview teaching and training. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books. He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is \"a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview\", and while he was alive included Colson's daily radio commentary, BreakPoint, which was heard in its original format on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States. Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 Evangelicals and Catholics Together ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States. Colson received 15 honorary doctorates, and in 1993 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world's largest annual award (over US$1 million) in the field of religion, given to a person who \"has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension\". He donated this prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush."

Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas. On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation. However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage. The Internal Revenue Service has also sued Washington, alleging that he owes $610,000 in unpaid taxes. On January 8, 2015, Washington received a suspension of his Texas attorney's license. The 335th District Court of Bastrop County, Texas found that Washington had violated various rules, including the rules prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and failing to keep a client reasonably informed. On March 12, 2015, a \"modified judgment was entered imposing a four-year partially probated suspension with 12 months active.\" He was also ordered to pay over $24,600 in legal fees and expenses. Washington filed an appeal."

He was born in 1869 in Richmond County, North Carolina. With the backing of Sen. Furnifold Simmons and the help of race-baiting tactics employed by A. D. Watts, Morrison defeated O. Max Gardner in the 1920 Democratic primary for Governor. He was later called \"the Good Roads governor\" for his support of a modern highway system. Morrison also pushed for increased funds for public education, while also battling the teaching of the theory of evolution. He was later appointed to serve as a United States Senator for the state of North Carolina (after the death of Lee S. Overman) between 1930 and 1932, but lost his seat in the Democratic primary runoff to Robert R. Reynolds. Morrison was later elected to one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He again lost a Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 1944, to Clyde R. Hoey. He died in Quebec City in 1953. A ten-story residence hall on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill is named in his honor. His home at Charlotte, Morrocroft, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983."

She re-entered the legislature after winning a by-election on May 11, 2011, in Vancouver-Point Grey, the seat left vacant by Campbell. Her government was re-elected in the 2013 provincial election, but Clark was defeated by David Eby in her own riding of Vancouver-Point Grey.

Moore is the first popularly elected female Lord Mayor of Sydney. Moore resigned as a state MP as a result of new state laws (labelled in the media as the \"Get Clover\" laws) preventing dual membership of state parliament and local councils. Following her re-election as mayor in the 2012 elections, she was forced to resign the state seat she held for 24 years before the first meeting of the new council. This resulted in a 2012 Sydney by-election on 27 October in which she endorsed independent candidate Alex Greenwich of the Australian Marriage Equality who won in a landslide victory."

  "text" : "Charles Augustus \"Charlie\" Semlin (4 December 1836 – November 2, 1927) was a British Columbia politician and rancher. Born near Barrie, Upper Canada, Semlin worked there as a schoolteacher until 1862 when he moved to British Columbia during the gold rush to become a prospector. Failing at that, he took work under Clement Francis Cornwall at the Ashcroft Manor Ranch. With Philip Parke he established the Cache Creek Hotel. In 1869 he purchased the Dominion Ranch and became a rancher. He entered politics when British Columbia became a province of Canada, in 1871, winning the Yale riding in the provincial legislature in 1871 and was defeated in 1876, though won election again in 1882. He as Leader of the Opposition in 1884. While in politics Semlin was instrumental in the building and operating of a boarding school in Cache Creek. The site was chosen there as Cache Creek was the midpoint between the Cariboo region to the north and the populated areas of the Lower Mainland to the south. He lost his seat in 1875 but returned to the assembly in 1882. In 1894 he became leader of the opposition and finally the 12th Premier of British Columbia in August 1898. His government lasted only two years and resigned to make way for the rump regime of Joseph Martin, who was defeated in the election of 1900. He died on November 3, 1927 at his ranch, which is just east of Cache Creek, British Columbia."

  "text" : "Charles-Melchior Arthus, Marquis de Bonchamps (10 May 1760 – 18 October 1793) was a French politician and leader of the Vendéan insurrection of Royalists against the Republic during the French Revolution. Born at Juvardeil, Anjou, he gained his first military experience in the American War of Independence, and on his return to France was made a captain of grenadiers in the French royal army. He was a staunch defender of the French monarchy, and at the outbreak of the Revolution, resigned his command and retired to his château at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil. Shortly before the revolution broke out, Bonchamps feared for his king and country and requested to be reinstated. In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of the Vendée, and his directives were able to secure a large amount of supplies and weapons that would greatly aid the counterrevolution. He was present at the taking of Bressuire, Thouars, and of Fontenay-le-Comte - where he was wounded but recovered. Dissensions among their leaders weakened the insurgents, and at the bloody battle of Cholet (October 1793) the Vendéans sustained a severe defeat and Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. His last act was the pardoning of five thousand Republican prisoners, whom his troops had sworn to kill in revenge for his death. Bonchamps was one of the best tactical leaders of the Vendéans and his death was an important victory for the republican forces. He was admired by the Christian monarchists and revolutionaries alike. A statue of him by Pierre Jean David stands in the church of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil."

In 2005 he was elected for a four-year term to the Thai House of Representatives, but in 2006 the Constitutional Court removed him from parliament. In October 2008 he again ran for governor of Bangkok as an independent but was not elected. In the July 2011 general election his party won four seats in the House of Representatives.

  "text" : "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda (30 April 1914 – 21 May 1977) was a Brazilian journalist and politician. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state. When he was a law student, Lacerda became sympathetic to left-wing ideas, but by the 1940s, he had transformed into a staunch anticommunist and conservative. He started his journalism career at Diário de Notícias (English: News Daily) in 1929. In 1949 he founded the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa (English: Press Tribune). Starting his political career in 1947, Lacerda was elected to the legislative chamber (city council) of the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1950, he was elected a National Democratic Union representative for the state of Rio in the Chamber of Deputies. He became well known for his uncompromising opposition of the government of President Getúlio Vargas and even demanded the overthrow of Vargas. He survived an assassination attempt in August 1954, which became known as the crime of Rua Tonelero. It is widely believed by historians to have been made by men acting under the orders of Gregório Fortunato, O Anjo Negro (Portuguese for \"The Black Angel\"), a black man, who was the head of Vargas' personal bodyguards. Brazilian Air Force Major Rubens Vaz was killed in the attempt, and Lacerda was slightly injured. That sparked a political crisis that culminated with the suicide of Vargas. Lacerda was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies later in 1954, with more votes than any other candidate. He also opposed the government of President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira. Lacerda was elected governor of Guanabara State, comprising Rio, in 1960. His administration was praised for his efforts to solve some chronic problems of Rio such as water services, public transportation and housing. An opinionated and controversial politician, Lacerda was involved in the crisis of the resignation of President Jânio Quadros in 1961 and conspired against the presidency of João Goulart. Hoping to be elected president in the 1965 elections, Lacerda initially supported the military coup d'état of 1964 and was nominated the UDN candidate. Since the military was not willing to give up power, the 1965 elections were cancelled, and Lacerda began to oppose the regime. In 1968, his efforts to restore democracy in Brazil made him ally with his old enemies, Kubitschek and Goulart, and Lacerda was arrested for a brief period and stripped of his right to run for political office for ten years. Then, he retired from politics and resumed his journalism and publishing career. In 1977, he died suddenly in Rio de Janeiro."

  "text" : "Cesar Epitácio Maia (born June 18, 1945) is a Brazilian politician, notable for having been elected three times for mayor of Rio de Janeiro. A native of Rio, born in 1945, Maia was forced to leave Brazil in exile during the 1960s on account of his affiliation with the Brazilian Communist Party. Exiled in Chile, he obtained a degree in economics, but the 1973 coup in the country saw him return to his native land. After becoming Professor of Macroeconomics at the Fluminense Federal University in the neighbouring city of Niterói, Maia became active in the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), founded by deceased left populist Leonel Brizola. Maia supported Brizola’s campaign to become Governor of Rio de Janeiro state in 1983, as Brazil was emerging from the military-led regime towards full democracy, and was subsequently appointed Treasury Secretary for the state. A trusted personal adviser to Brizola, who was instrumental in uncovering and denouncing the allegedly electoral fraud that threatened Brizola's gubernatorial election in 1982, the so-called Proconsult scheme, Maia was to be elected to the national Chamber of Deputies in 1986, and saw re-election in 1990. Meanwhile, having achieved personal political proeminence in the late 1980s, Maia broke with Brizola and the PDT, affiliating with the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) in 1991, being elected mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro for the first time in 1992, defeating the Workers' Party candidate, Afro-Brazilian Benedita da Silva in a run-off election, in a campaign that was regarded by some as being driven by racist ideology. Maia subsequently left the PMDB and joined the Liberal Front Party (PFL)."

  "text" : "Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (August 27, 1637 – February 21, 1715), inherited the colony in 1675 upon the death of his father, Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, (1605–1675). He had been his father's Deputy Governor since 1661 when he arrived in the colony at the age of 24. However, Charles left Maryland for England in 1684 and would never return. The events following the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688 would cost Calvert his title to Maryland; in 1689 the royal charter to the colony was withdrawn, leading to direct rule by the British Crown. Calvert's political problems were largely caused by his Roman Catholic faith which was at odds with the established Church of England. Calvert married four times, outliving three wives, and had at least two children. He died in England in 1715 at the age of 78, his family fortunes much diminished. With his death he passed his title, and his claim to Maryland, to his second son Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715), his eldest son Cecil having died young. However, Benedict Calvert would outlive his father by just two months, and It would fall to Charles' grandson, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, (1699–1751), (who converted to the Anglican faith) to see the family proprietorship in Maryland restored by the king."

He became a Quaker in 1980. He first came to Ottawa in his teens when his father worked there. Doucet played for the Carleton Ravens football team for one season, and then moved to the University of Toronto. A football injury took him out of that sport and into the sport of rowing. In his younger days, he spent a summer working in a rock copper mine in British Columbia and helped build the National Arts Centre as a construction worker. Before entering politics, Doucet was a municipal affairs policy advisor."

  "text" : "Cris Aglugub is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2007. Aglugub was educated at Araneta University Foundation in the Philippines, and at Red River Community College in Manitoba. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture. Before entering politics, he worked as a computer programmer and provided technical support to Manitoba Agriculture. He has served on the Mayor's Race Relations Committee and the Manitoba Citizenship Council's Language Bank, and is a Past President of the Philippine Association of Manitoba. He co-founded the Philippine Centre of Manitoba in 1984, and was instrumental in founding a community day care facility. During the 1990s, Aglugub helped facilitate a twinning agreement between Winnipeg and Manila, with a corresponding arrangement between the University of Manitoba and the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Aglugub was elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1999, running as a New Democrat in the north Winnipeg riding of The Maples. He received 4,329 votes against 2,310 for his nearest opponent, Progressive Conservative Ellen Kowalski. Following the election, he was named Legislative Assistant to the Minister of Labour and Immigration, and subsequently to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie's bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party. Aglugub was easily re-elected in the Manitoba general election of 2003, receiving about 68% of the vote in The Maples. He was not re-nominated for the New Democratic Party in the 2007 provincial election. He ran in the 2011 Provincial Election as a Progressive Conservative in the riding of Tyndall Park but finished third behind Ted Marcelino of the NDP and Roldan Sevillano of the Liberals."

He married Noreen Browne in 1931. He died in action in Burma on 25 February 1944, where he was serving as a Sergeant in the British Army, as part of the 54th Training Regiment of the Royal Armoured Corps."

  "text" : "Charles John Taylor (1826–1897) was a New Zealand politician. He was the second son of General Taylor (1790-1868) of West Tamaki. Charles was a judge in India, before buying land in the Auckland area and a director of The Bank of New Zealand, of which his brother, Allan Kerr Taylor, was auditor Charles John Taylor had two brothers and one half brother who lived in Auckland: The names of their properties later became the names of the suburbs - Charles John Taylor at Glen Orchard (now St Heliers), William Innes Taylor at Glen Innes, and Richard James Taylor at Glen Dowie. The half brother Allan Kerr Taylor lived in Mount Albert in a house called Alberton; it is possibly to differentiate themselves from the main part of the family that the Mt Albert Talyors adopted Allan's middle name as part of their surname - becoming the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors. This may well have simply grown out of the social conventions of the period. Charles John Taylor served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament and the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Southern Division; (consisting of the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and East Cape regions). He resigned on 13 April 1858. From the 1861 election, he served in the 3rd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Raglan electorate. He resigned from Raglan before the end of that term on 1 April 1865. His election statement for the 1861 election read, \"Having always held opinions opposed to a centralising policy, I should vote for the repeal of the \"New Provinces Act.” I am prepared to unite with the other representatives of this province in obtaining a sweeping reduction in the expenditure now lavished on an overgrown and daily increasing official staff, and to act in concert with those gentlemen that Auckland may hold the prominent position due to her in the government of the colony.\" In that election he defeated Theodore Haultain. He represented the Southern Division electorate on the 3rd Auckland Provincial Council from 26 October 1860 to 12 September 1861. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 31 March 1869. His membership lapsed on 26 July 1878 through absence, when he and his family went to live in England."

  "text" : "Cherie Killian Berry is the current North Carolina Commissioner of Labor, a member of the North Carolina Council of State and head of the North Carolina Department of Labor. Berry was born in Newton, North Carolina and owned a spark plug manufacturing business in Catawba County, North Carolina. A businesswoman, Berry served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1993 to 2000, where she chaired the commerce committee. In November 2000, she was elected state labor commissioner, the first woman to hold the post. A Republican, (the only Republican on the Council of State between 2001 and 2005), she bested Democrat Wayne Goodwin to win a second term in the 2004 statewide elections. Berry narrowly defeated Mary Fant Donnan to keep her seat in the 2008 election. Berry won a fourth four-year term in November 2012, defeating former Labor Commissioner John C. Brooks by more than 280,000 votes. Berry was criticized in a newspaper report on poultry plant oversight. Berry's fundraising has also been called into question by the Charlotte Observer."

In September 2016, Fjellner joined more than 50 MEPs from six different political groups – including Ashley Fox, Alojz Peterle, Vicky Ford and Beatrix von Storch – in signing a proposal for a two-term limit of the President of the European Parliament. This move was widely seen as an effort to prevent incumbent Martin Schulz from holding onto the presidency for a third consecutive term."

Ganley was born in Plymouth, the daughter of a tailor. She became politically active in 1906 in opposition to the Boer War, and joined the Social Democratic Federation that year. She actively supported women's suffrage and helped set up what would become the Women's Labour League branch in Battersea. She became involved in the British Committee of the International Congress for Peace and Freedom in 1914. Ganley was a school manager and governor, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP) in 1920, one of London's first female magistrates. She joined the Labour and Co-operative Parties and served on Battersea Council (1919–25, 1953–65) and the London County Council (1925–29 and 1934–37), and was a member of the London County Education Committee. She contested the Paddington North seat at the 1935 general election. At the 1945 general election, Ganley was elected as Member of Parliament for Battersea South. She narrowly held the seat in 1950 but was defeated by Ernest Partridge in 1951. Ganley was elected a director of the West London Co-operative Society in 1918 and served on the board of its successor, the London Co-operative Society for many years and as President 1942-46, its first woman president. She held national positions in the Women's Co-operative Guild and was one of the speakers at its diamond jubilee celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943. She was awarded the CBE in 1953."

Detained under the Internal Security Act of Singapore for allegedly conducting pro-communist activities against the government, he was imprisoned for 23 years without charge or trial and subsequently placed under conditions of house arrest for another nine years – in which he was first confined to the island of Sentosa and then subject to restrictions on his place of abode, employment, travel, and exercise of political rights. Prior to his detention, he had been a teacher, a physics lecturer, a socialist political activist and a member of the Parliament of Singapore. Subsequent to it, he has been a doctoral student and an interpreter. He travelled to Germany in 1997, and to the Netherlands at least as recently as 2000. The supervision of his PhD thesis in development economics was completed in 2006."

  "text" : "(This article is about the Sinn Féin politician. For the American ice hockey player, see Connor Murphy.) Conor Terence Murphy (born 10 July 1963) is an Irish republican Sinn Féin politician who is the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland for Newry and Armagh. He served as the Member of Parliament for Newry and Armagh from 2005-2015. Murphy was born in Camlough, South Armagh and joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the 1981 hunger strikes. In 1982 he was sentenced to five years in prison for IRA membership and possession of explosives. Between 1989 and 1997, he was a Sinn Féin councillor on Newry and Mourne District Council for The Fews area, in South Armagh and South Down, and served as his party's group leader at that level. In 1998, Murphy was elected as one of his party's two Northern Ireland Assembly members for Newry and Armagh. He was re-elected, with two party colleagues, to the Assembly in 2003. He lives in Camlough, County Armagh with his wife Catherine, his daughter Áine and his son Oisín. He attended St Colman's College, Newry, Queen's University of Belfast (QUB), and the University of Ulster. In 2001, he contested the Newry and Armagh Westminster seat, coming second to incumbent Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). When Mallon decided not to contest the seat again, Murphy became the clear favourite to win and was elected on 5 May 2005. He refused to take his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in line with the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin. In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he served as the Minister for Regional Development in the Northern Ireland Executive from 8 May 2007 until 16 May 2011. While on a tour of UK party conferences in autumn 2005, he became the first Irish republican to address the Conservative Party conference and caused controversy by refusing to express regret over the Brighton hotel bombing. In 2011, while Minister for Regional Development, Murphy appointed Sean Hogan, a Catholic, as head of Northern Ireland Water, turning down the applications of four Protestants on the shortlist. A tribunal subsequently awarded £150,000 damages for discrimination to one of these applicants, Alan Lennon, judging that Hogan was appointed because \"he was not from a Protestant background and because he was known to the minister and his (then Sinn Fein) ministerial colleagues Michelle Gildernew and Caitriona Ruane, who were consulted about the appointment.\" The tribunal found Murphy's evidence was \"implausible and lack[ing] credibility\", and that, during Murphy's tenure at the Department for Regional Development, there was a \"material bias against the appointment of candidates from a Protestant background\". Murphy disputed the finding which he said branded him \"sectarian\". Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness defended him, claiming Murphy doesn't have \"a sectarian bone in his body\". In December 2012, Murphy appeared as a witness at Belfast High Court in the case of Declan Gormley, whom Murphy had sacked in 2010 from his post as a non-executive director of NI Water. Gormley sued Sinn Féin over two press releases which he argued were defamatory. Gormley was subsequently offered £80,000 in damages."

She was then elected a Member of the European Parliament (1979–1984).

He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Carmen Provenzano was a graduate of St. Mary's College in the Sault. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Windsor, and a law degree (LLB) from Queen's University in Kingston. On graduation, he started his legal career in the city of Sault Ste. Marie's legal department, and for 25 years was self-employed in legal private practice in the Sault, specializing in municipal and planning law. He served as a charter member of the Algoma District Health Council, and for 13 consecutive years as a trustee on the Sault Ste. Marie Board of Education, where he served on all committees, including finance (chair) and salary negotiation. Provenzano was the past chair of the Northern Ontario Liberal caucus. After his election to Parliament in 1997 and re-election in 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, and was on several standing committees of the House of Commons, including fisheries and oceans (vice-chair), government operations and natural resources (vice-chair), and national defence and veterans affairs. He was also a member of the parliamentary steel caucus. As the Sault's MP, he considered his involvement in the successful restructuring of Algoma Steel a significant personal achievement. He was married to his wife Ada for nearly forty years, and together they had four children. Provenzano died from a sudden heart attack on July 27, 2005. His nephew Christian Provenzano ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals in his former riding during the 2006 federal election and the 2011 federal election, and was elected mayor of Sault Ste.

  "text" : "Chris Korwin-Kuczynski (born 1953) is a former Canadian municipal politician. He served as a councillor in Toronto from 1981 to 2003, and was the city's deputy mayor for a time. He was born in Toronto, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from York University. He has been a director of the Polish-Canadian Congress, and has served as a special assistant to the federal Minister of State for Multiculturalism. He ran unsuccessfully for city council in 1980 as Chris Korwin but was successful on his second attempt, in a 1981 by-election. In 1992, Korwin-Kuczynski successfully urged that the music group Barenaked Ladies be banned from performing a concert in Nathan Phillips Square because he believed their name objectified women (Toronto Star, 20 July 2005). This decision was widely ridiculed, and gave considerable publicity to the then-obscure band. Korwin-Kuczynski was a member of the council's right-wing, and was a frequent ally of fellow councillor Tom Jakobek (Toronto Star, 29 November 1994). Kyle Rae has suggested that Korwin-Kuczynski became isolated on council when Jakobek left in 2000 (Globe and Mail, 16 September 2003). In 1993, Korwin-Kuczynski was removed as chair of the Toronto Board of Health after criticizing a strongly worded AIDS prevention pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto (Toronto Star, 23 January 1993). He had suggested that the Committee, which received significant support from Toronto's gay community, be denied city funding if it continued publishing such materials (Globe and Mail, 25 January 1995). Referring to his dismissal after the vote, he commented, \"[t]he only real issue I think this all stems from is AIDS, the whole issue surrounding the gay issue\" (Toronto Star, 22 January 1993). Kyle Rae, who is openly gay, has said that Korwin-Kuczynski was anti-gay during the early 1990s but later changed his views. In 2003, Rae was quoted as saying, \"He's now generally supportive of these issues, but that didn't come easily.\" He opposed a 1996 municipal bill that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, and requested that provincial Premier Mike Harris veto the measure (Montreal Gazette, 8 July 1996). Korwin-Kuczynski considered running for the Liberal nomination in Parkdale—High Park in the 1997 federal election, but ultimately declined (Toronto Star, 16 February 1997). He retired from the council in 2003, amid rumours that he would move into consulting work (Toronto Star, 24 December 2003). He endorsed Dennis Mills's bid for re-election in the 2004 federal election, and a newspaper report from the period suggest that he was considering running as a Liberal candidate in the next federal election (Globe and Mail, 22 December 2003). On September 27, 2006, he filed papers to run in the Toronto municipal election, 2006 in Ward 14. However the next day he withdrew his nomination. This allowed him to retain a fundraising surplus of $21,742 leftover from his last campaign. If he hadn't done this the money would have flowed into the city coffers. Korwin-Kuczynski is a former honorary Captain of the Canadian Navy, and once served as a Director on the board of the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. His nickname is K-K."

  "text" : "Chris Bombolas (born 12 May 1960) (often known as Bomber) is a communications and media specialist, and a television and radio presenter. A former sports reporter for 21 years with the Nine Network in Brisbane. A former Australian politician, he served for one term as the Labor member for Chatsworth in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 2006 to 2009. Bombolas was born in Newcastle, New South Wales. Whilst working for the Qld Police Dept he graduated from the Queensland University of Technology with a Bachelor of Business degree in Communications. He became a radio host and worked for 4BC, 4BK and Triple M, before joining the Channel Nine as a sports presenter. In July 2006, Bombolas believed he could \"make a difference in my community\", and announced his intention to run for the Australian Labor Party in the seat of Chatsworth in the 2006 election. Bombolas won the seat against the incumbent member Michael Caltabiano of the Liberal Party. On 9 July 2007, Bombolas became Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Sport and Local Government, Andrew Fraser. Bombolas announced on 19 February 2009 that he would not contest the 2009 state election. In June 2009, Bombolas became the Chairman of the A-league football club Brisbane Roar. His controversial decision to replace coach Frank Farina with Ange Postecoglou saw the Brisbane Roar win the record for the longest unbeaten run at the top level of any Australian football code, which stands at 36 league matches without defeat.[3] Brisbane Roar are also the first and only club to win back to back A-League Championships.[4] In 2012, Bombolas was asked to join Hancock Coal/GVK as their External Affairs Advisor (Media & Corporate Communications Advisor). He now works as a freelance Media and Communications Specialist, plus is a qualified Auctioneer."

He was born in Halifax County, North Carolina in 1869. His father was William H. Kitchin and William Walton Kitchin was his brother. First elected in 1900, after his party secured a constitutional amendment excluding blacks from the ballot boxes of the state, a campaign in which he served as a leading orator, he served in Congress as a member of the Democratic Party until his death. In Congress, he served on the House Ways and Means Committee, chairing the Committee from 1915 to 1919. From 1915 to 1919 he was House majority leader; from this position he opposed the Wilson administration's \"Preparedness\" crusade, seeking unsuccessfully to hold down the growth in size of the army and navy. He was one of the representatives who voted against declaring war on Germany in April 1917; indeed, his example and speech against American entry probably swelled the number of dissenters to 50. He threw himself into the war effort thereafter but remained a critic of some of the administration's war policies, especially regarding taxation policies. He championed an \"excess profits\" tax that was steeply progressive over a policy of selling Liberty Bonds that shifted the financial burden of the war onto future generations. After giving an impassioned speech in 1920 he suffered a severe stroke, from which he never recovered."

  "text" : "Carleton \"Carty\" S. Finkbeiner (born May 30, 1939, in Toledo, Ohio) is a Democratic Party (United States) politician who is the former mayor of Toledo, Ohio. First elected in 1993, he took office on January 1, 1994. In 1997, he defeated challenger Nick Wichowski to win a second term. Term limits prevented him from running a third consecutive time. He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board. He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005. On June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Finkbeiner has proved to be a very controversial mayor for the city of Toledo due to many of his policies, behavior, and public gaffes (see \"Controversy\" section). Toward the end of Finkbeiner's third term as mayor a recall effort drive to remove him from office was successfully put on the ballot but was ultimately struck down by the Ohio Supreme Court due to technicalities. Carty announced that his third run as mayor will be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit  which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbiener in 2010. Finkbeiner currently resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren. Carlton Finkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015."

  "text" : "Charles Wainman Burson was a legal counsel and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States under Al Gore. He assumed the position of legal counsel from Kumiki Gibson in February 1997 after serving almost a decade as Tennessee Attorney General. In 1999 Charles Burson became Gore's Chief of Staff, replacing Ron Klain who resigned in August of that year. Burson is the son of Josie Burson and Leo Burson. He grew up in Shelby County, Tennessee, where he graduated from Central High School in Memphis in 1962. Burson received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Michigan, his Master of Arts from the University of Cambridge, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. Burson was a friend of Gore for over three decades at the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States. Charles Burson first became friends with the future Vice President in 1968 during the time Gore was studying Tennessee history at Memphis State University. In 1984 he was the chairman of Gore's senatorial campaign. This continued a family tradition of involvement with the Gores. Burson's parents were active in Tennessee Democratic politics, and his mother had held a position in Albert Gore Sr.'s senatorial campaign in 1958. Before joining the White House, Charles Burson held a variety of public and private roles. From 1970 until 1988, he worked in private practice as a lawyer. He briefly flirted with active politics in the 1978 when he lost a race to Republican Ed Williams for the East Memphis seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1988 he was appointed the Tennessee Attorney General. In this capacity, Burson served on a number of public legal bodies. He was a member of the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, of the Tennessee Code Commission and of the Commission on the Future of the Judicial System. Burson also represented the state several times before the Supreme Court of the United States. One notable case he argued was Burson v. Freeman, which established a state's ability to regulate election advertising on voting day. After his time in the White House, Burson served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the global agribusiness corporation, Monsanto. Burson is married to Bunny Burson and has two daughters, Clare and Kate. He presently resides in St. Louis, Missouri, teaches at the Washington University School of Law and is of counsel to the St. Louis law firm Bryan Cave."

He has been described as a \"right-wing extremist\" by the Daily Telegraph; and as someone who \"even by South African standards...has acquired over the years a reputation as a rabid racist\" by journalist & South Africa commentator John Carlin. He was described by anti-apartheid opposition leader Harry Schwarz as the \"biggest racist in Parliament\". He was repeatedly denied parole since he began applying in 2010, most recently in January 2015, after objections from the Hani family. After multiple times being declined parole, his appeal was taken to court where the judge granted him medical parole on 29 May 2015. He was released from prison in June 2015 after serving 22 years, due to his terminal lung cancer."

  "text" : "Ciro Ferreira Gomes (born 6 November 1957, Pindamonhangaba, São Paulo) is a Brazilian lawyer and politician. He was a founding member of the right wing Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), but left the party in 1996. He later moved to the Socialist People's Party (PPS) and ran as the PPS' presidential candidate in 1998 and 2002. In 1998 he came in third place and won 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place and won 12% of the vote. He supported Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the second round of the latter election, and was ultimately chosen to be the Minister for National Integration in Lula's new government. When the PPS' leadership voted to leave the governing coalition in December 2004, Gomes chose to remain in his post. As a result, the PPS removed him from the party leadership, and he decided to join the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB). In 2006 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies with the highest percentage ever achieved by a single candidate in a proportional election - 16.7%. Ciro Gomes became governor of the Brazilian northeastern state of Ceará in 1990, at the age of 32. The three and a half years he spent as governor coincided with important social reforms. He attracted much international investment, and Unicef praised him for cutting infant mortality by a third. He also famously built a water canal 71 miles long in only 90 days to Fortaleza, the capital, to prevent a water supply crisis. In 1994 he briefly served as finance minister at a crucial time when the Real Plan was underway as an economic stabilization program. His performance helped Fernando Henrique Cardoso win the election, but he broke with the Cardoso government in 1997."

  "text" : "Christopher Knudsen (4 October 1843 – 28 July 1915) was a Norwegian priest and politician for the Conservative Party. He was Minister of Education and Church Affairs from 1905 to 1906. Knudsen was born in Drammen as a son of railroad worker Knud Larssen (1814–66) and Marie A. Christophersen Aaserud (1812–1890). He was married twice; first from February 1869 to Marie Charlotte Andrea Hermanstorff (1849–1873), then from September 1874 to Ida Regine Lohne (1855–1949). He was an uncle of politician Knud Christian Knudsen. He finished his secondary education in 1861, graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1867, and in 1879 he became vicar in the newly established parish of Nedre Eiker. When Nedre Eiker became its own municipality in 1885, he sat in the municipal council and on the school board and was elected mayor. He left Nedre Eiker in 1886, and became a curate in Drammen. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from that city in 1894 and 1897. He was then elected for a third term in 1900 from the constituency Tønsberg, where he had been appointed vicar. On 11 March 1905, when Michelsen's Cabinet assumed office, Knudsen was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs. This cabinet oversaw the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Knudsen left the cabinet on 26 January 1906."

Baker had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of colonel but resigned following his election as lieutenant governor, during which time he played an important role in overseeing the formation and training of states levies. He served as acting-governor for five months during the illness of Governor Oliver Morton, and was elevated to Governor following Morton's resignation from office. During Baker's full term as governor, he focused primitively on the creation and improvement of institutions to help veterans and their families that had been disaffected by the war. He also championed the post-war federal constitutional amendments, and was able to successfully advocate their acceptance."

He went on to do his BCL at Wadham College, Oxford, where he has acted as an Honorary Fellow since 1993. In 2009 he said the Civil Nuclear Constabularies \"approach to covert activity is conspicuously professional'. He found that the system for storing the intelligence gained from informers was 'working well' and that 'senior officers regard covert surveillance as a long-term requirement\"."

  "text" : "Claude Matthews (December 14, 1845 – April 28, 1898) was the 23rd Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1893 to 1897. A farmer, he was nominated to prevent the loss of voters to the Populist Party. The Panic of 1893 occurred just before he took office, leading to severe economic problems during his term. Republicans took the Indiana General Assembly in the 1894 mid-term election and repudiated many of the Democrats' laws, leading to violence in the assembly. A popular party figure when he left office, he was a nominee to run for president at the 1896 Democratic National Convention, but lost his bid for the candidacy."

  "text" : "Cornelis van Aerssen (also Aerssen, Aersen, Aarsens) (1545 - 22 March 1627) was a statesman in Holland. Van Aerssen was born in Antwerp. From 1611 he was Heer van Spijk (Lord of Spijk, sometimes spelt Spyck) and was the father of Frans van Aarsens. For many years, he was registrat to the States-General. He died in The Hague. He was almost certainly the son of an Antwerp courtier, who was favoured by the court at Brussels. Von Aerssen himself in 1574 entered office as a city secretary of Brussels. In the following year he was appointed the pensioner of the city. Although in religious matters he was known as a tolerant man, he was against a reconciliation with Philip II of Spain. Von Aerssen travelled often, and on the day of the murder of William of the Silent, he was also in Den Haag. In 1584 he was sent with other delegates to France. The goal of this delegation was to negotiate with the French king Henry IV over the sovereignty of Dutch Republic. Cornelis van Aerssen was in the same year appointed an official of the Dutch Estates-General, but continued to live in Brussels, which raised the suspicion that he was plotting with the Spanish. He played a leading role in the Orange-reformed party. When the Spanish Admiral Francisco de Mendoza was in Woerden and Den Haag as a Dutch prisoner after the Battle of Nieuport, and wanted to start peace negotiations, Van Aerssen was named a Dutch representative alongside the land's advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and the Franciscan Johan Meyen sent by Archduke Albrecht. Van Aerssen negotiated with the Spanish envoy, and on 4 May 1602 agreed an 8-month cease-fire. Oldenbarnevelt, at the head of the party aiming for peace, welcomed this, as he feared the growing power of the Dutch Stadtholder Moritz von Oranien-Nassaus.

  "text" : "Christopher Fettes (born 1937) is a founder of the Irish Green Party and an honorary member of the International Vegetarian Union and of the World Esperanto Association. He was born in Bromley, Kent, England and educated at Clayesmore School, Dorset, and in English and French at the University of Dublin, he taught for a year in France and then for 37 years at Saint Columba's College, Dublin, for most of that time as a housemaster. During that period he revived the Irish Anti-Vivisection Society and the Esperanto Association of Ireland, became an Irish citizen in 1970, and founded the Vegetarian Society of Ireland and was Secretary of the European Vegetarian Union. In 1981 he initiated and chaired the founding meeting of the Ecology Party of Ireland, which later became the Irish Green Party. He stood unsuccessfully as a Green candidate for the European Parliament in 1984. He contested the 2002 general election and the 2011 general election in the Laois–Offaly constituency. At present he is a government appointee on the Central Council of the Irish Red Cross. For many years Fettes accompanied children to Esperanto youth and family gatherings in various European countries. From 1988 to 1996 he served as international coordinator for the International Children's Camps of the World Esperanto Association. In 1991 he purchased the remains of the Bloomville estate: 55 acres of land with a decaying Georgian farmhouse in County Offaly. Since he retired in 2000 this has been slowly restored, and in 2011 was highlighted by the Engage with Architecture Centre in Tullamore. From time to time he organizes small conferences for sections of the Green Party, the Tolkien Society, the Open Christianity Network and other bodies; the estate, where many thousands of deciduous trees have been planted and the wilder aspects preserved, is frequented by families seeking a stimulating natural environment for their children. In addition, Esperanto-speakers from as far away as Australia and Brazil, Japan and Korea are regularly provided with free accommodation."

He was the son of Dr. Daniel Trigg of Abingdon and Anna Munford Tompkins, who was a lineal descendant of William Byrd of Westover and Robert \"King\" Carter. This also made him a cousin of General Robert E. Lee. During the Civil War, he was a private in the First Virginia Cavalry and also served in the Confederate States Navy. After the war, he was elected Commonwealth attorney for Washington County in 1872, which position he held until he resigned in 1884 to become a candidate for Congress. He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-ninth Congress (March 4, 1885 to March 3, 1887). He resumed the practice of law. He died in Abingdon on April 23, 1907 and was buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery."

In early 2000 he joined the party We Are Peru of Lima's charismatic mayor Alberto Andrade, which he left later in the same year. In 2001 he became the campaign manager for Possible Peru (PP) of successful presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo in Lima. In President Toledo's administration, Bruce held different important posts: Presidency minister from mid-2001 to mid-2002 and Minister of Housing, Construction and Sanitation from July 2002 through October 2005. From 2002 to 2005 he was a General secretary of PP party. He was the candidate to Second Vice-President on the party's ticket in the 2006 national election, but the candidacy was withdrawn following disputes between presidential candidate Rafael Belaúnde Aubry and the party's core. Since September 2005 he has been a member of the party's national political commission. In 2006 Bruce was elected to the Congress representing Lima for the 2006-2011 term. 2010/11 he managed the campaign of Toledo for a second presidential term, endorsed by Possible Peru Alliance with himself being Toledo's running mate as candidate for First vice president. Toledo's presidential bid was unsuccessful, but Carlos Bruce was re-elected Congressman for another 5-year term. On July 29, 2011, he was accused of a dishonor for his political party and has been suspended being independent in congress. Now Possible Peru has decreased from 21 to 20 members of the political party in congress."

In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia, she sat on the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture and the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts, as well as serving as the opposition critic on the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, followed by the critic on child care, early childhood development, and women's issues. In the 39th Parliament she acted as a deputy speaker before returning to her role as critic on the children and family development portfolio. In the 40th Parliament, she was the critic on transportation and BC Ferries and, in that role, produced a report comparing the BC Ferries system with the Washington State Ferries system and introduced the Provincial Shipbuilding Act in both 2014 and 2015 seeking to have future ferries constructed in Canada. Originally from England, Trevena has a background in journalism having worked as a Canadian correspondent for British media. After she immigrated, she worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and then as a public information officer for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. After moving to British Columbia with her husband, she started her own business specializing communication strategies. She unsuccessfully filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal after being fired from a job because of her political affiliation. She was an advocate of renovations to the hospitals in Campbell River and Comox, opposing the health authority's plans to replace them with a new regional hospital near Courtenay. In November 2010, Trevena was one of thirteen party members to ask for a leadership convention, resulting in the resignation of Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. She endorsed John Horgan in both the 2011 and 2014 leadership elections."

  "text" : "Charlotte Anne Laws (born May 11, 1960) is an American author, talk show host, community activist, animal rights advocate, anti-revenge porn activist, former Los Angeles politician, and actress under the stage name Missy Laws. Laws was a weekly commentator on the television show The Filter with Fred Roggin from August 2009 until 2013 when the show went off the air. One of her episodes was nominated for an Emmy. Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet."

  "text" : "Chester A. Kowal (August 17, 1904 – September 28, 1966) was an American politician, a basketball player, a boxer and a World War II veteran. From 1962 to 1965 he was mayor of Buffalo, New York; he holds the distinction of being the last Republican mayor of that city to date. He was born into a Polish-American family in Buffalo on August 17, 1904. The family operated a grocery store at 55 Gittere Street. He attended Hutchinson Central High School. He turned down a basketball scholarship to Canisius College in Buffalo in order to play professionally to earn money. He played with the once world champion German Orioles and the Buffalo Lincolns basketball teams, and also played semi-pro baseball with the Easter Brands. He boxed with the Western New York AAU and was a contender for the U.S. Olympic boxing team. He was married to a Polish-American woman, Stephanie Adamski. His family started Walden Bottling Works in 1924; he managed the company in his spare time. In late 1942, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces as a private and was sent to Officers' Training School. He saw service in the U.S. Southwest before serving five months in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In April 1946 he was discharged as a lieutenant-colonel. He was active in veterans organizations. In 1951, Kowal was elected Buffalo city comptroller on the Republican ticket. He was defeated in his run for mayor in the 1957 election by Frank A. Sedita, but prevailed in the mayoral election held on November 7, 1961. He served a single term as mayor. On September 28, 1966, he died in his sleep."

In 1998, in order to keep the presidency of the regional council, he agreed on being elected with votes from Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front and was subsequently expelled from the UDF. He then created his own party, called \"The Right\", aiming at federating French libertarians and conservatives, which met limited success. He ran in 2001 for Mayor of Lyon. He has been nominated in 2003 as France's ambassador to FAO, where he advocates for the development of Africa."

The Canard Enchaîné revealed first that his tax position is subject to scrutiny by the tax, so usually the fiscal situation of Ministers is be reviewed and corrected if necessary, upon taking office. Shortly after, he was criticized for making purchase in the budget of his department for €12,000 cigars in ten months, it was finally resolved, at the direction of François Fillon, to be repaid in full.

After serving as an independent member of the Chamber of Deputies for one mandate (1899-1903), he aligned his views with those of Take Ionescu, and became a supporter of Romania's entry into World War I alongside the Entente Powers. In addition to his political career, Mille was the author of two autobiographical novels (Dinu Millian, 1884, and O viaţă, 1914)."

Howard survived her by 36 years and died in April 1879, aged 65 at Holker House, the Lancashire seat of the Duke of Devonshire; Mr Howard's brother-in-law. His only son George succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Cumberland East and in 1889 also succeeded his uncle as ninth Earl of Carlisle."

  "text" : "Chris Trotter (born c. 1956) is a left-leaning political commentator in New Zealand. He is the editor of the occasional Political Review magazine, and is a regular speaker, orator and singer at left-wing, union and socialist events. Trotter has worked for unions and was on the New Zealand council of the Labour Party. He writes the \"From the Left\" column in the Dominion Post, and has also contributed to the Independent Financial Review. He makes semi-frequent television appearances as a political commentator. He has attracted criticism from other broad left critics who regard his knowledge of feminist, indigenous and LGBT politics to be insignificant, particularly insofar as their own distributive justice dimensions are concerned Trotter is the author of No Left Turn, a political history of New Zealand. Novelist, poet and critic C K Stead described the book as \"a dashingly written and persuasive elegy for the Scandinavian-style socialist democracy New Zealand might have been, and at the same time a realistic (though at times appropriately angry) acknowledgement that, given the forces, internal and external, ranged against it, the chances of it happening, and lasting, were never very good.\" In February 2008, he said that Helen Clark should stand down before the election and be replaced by Phil Goff, who he thought may have been Labour's only hope of regaining ground with struggling families. He has since recanted, arguing that Goff should have stood down in his turn before the New Zealand general election, 2011, arguing that David Cunliffe should replace him."

  "text" : "Chris Collins (born June 23, 1962) is a politician from Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, currently the sitting MLA (Liberal) for the riding of Moncton East, having previously served part of one term as a city councillor for Moncton City Council. On October 24, 2014 Collins was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick succeeding Dale Graham. Collins first entered politics as a New Brunswick New Democratic Party candidate in the 1987 election. He was not active in politics thereafter until his son, Sean, became ill with cancer in 2002. Frustrated by the lack of support by the lack of assistance in travel costs for him and his family to go see his son who was being treated at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he tried to meet his local Member of Legislative Assembly. That MLA was Bernard Lord, who was concurrently serving as Premier of New Brunswick and would not take his meetings. Frustrated, Collins ran against Lord, a Progressive Conservative, under the Liberal banner. Collins made it a close race and for parts of election night, Collins led Lord, though Lord was eventually victorious by a margin of 10%. Collins sought election to Moncton City Council in the 2004 municipal elections and won. He was widely expected to face Lord in a rematch in what would have been the 2006 election but was travelling to Australia with his son when the election was called a year earlier than expected. Collins was elected however to replace Lord in a by-election on March 5, 2007 after Lord resigned the leadership of his party and his seat in the legislature following his government's defeat in the 2006 election. Collins' son Sean died on July 9, 2007 at the age of 13."

He broke with the government over arms sales to the Soviet Union, and in the late 1930s Blaisot was associated with the Liberty Front created by Jacques Doriot. Blaisot did not vote in the parliamentary sessions at Vichy which granted extraordinary powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain and created the Vichy Regime. His attitude and activities led to his arrest by German security forces on 2 March 1944. He was initially held in a camp near Compiègne and later sent to Dachau concentration camp where he died in 1945. A number of schools and streets are named in his honour."

  "text" : "Carlos Loret de Mola Mediz (July 30, 1921, in Mérida, Yucatán – February 7, 1986, in Guerrero) was a Mexican politician and journalist, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and deputy, senator and Governor of Yucatán. His father, Carlos Loret de Mola Medina, was a railroad worker, and his mother, Loreto Mediz Bolio de Loret de Mola, was a sister of the poet Antonio Mediz Bolio. Carlos Loret de Mola was elected governor in 1970 after an election against the candidate of the PAN, Víctor Correa Rachó, who questioned the election results but finally had a good relationship with Loret de Mola. During his government faced several times with President Luis Echeverría, the Governor of Campeche, Carlos Sansores Pérez and the political leader in Yucatán, Víctor Cervera. The killing of a labor lawyer and independent trade union leader, Efrain Calderón Lara (a) \"El Charras\", accused police officers contaminated by the Governor of Campeche, Sansores Pérez shook his government while his six-year term was finished even with the recognition of those who had been their adversaries. Read what he said in Diario de Yucatán who questioned him at the beginning of his administration. He subsequently continued his journalistic career. During this period was faced with some characters of political power by their complaints about crime and corruption. Officially Carlos Loret de Mola lost his life in an accident in automobile in Guerrero, but his son, Rafael Loret de Mola, has always maintained that he was killed with an abundance of evidence that had no judicial follow-up for political reasons. Carlos Loret de Mola was a journalist who wrote and directed several newspapers in various parts of the country, especially in Guanajuato and Chihuahua, enjoying broad recognition and prestige. Two members of his family continued their profession: his son, journalist and writer Rafael Loret de Mola, one of the toughest critics of the Mexican political system, and his grandson and son of Rafael, the television journalist Carlos Loret de Mola. Among his books are: Ángel sin Ojos, Yucatán en la Patria, Manuel Cepeda Peraza Soldado y Estadista de la República, Confesiones de un Gobernador, Los Últimos 91 Días, Los Caciques, Mil Días de Quetzalcóatl, El Juicio y su obra póstuma and Que la Nación me lo Demande."

She represented the electoral district of Lunenburg West in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2003 to 2009 as a member of the Progressive Conservatives. Born in 1964 at Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Bolivar-Getson graduated from Saint Mary's University with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. She owned and operated a general store in Newcombville. In 1997, she was elected as a municipal councillor in Lunenburg County. Bolivar-Getson entered provincial politics in the 2003 election, winning the Lunenburg West riding. In August 2003, she was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Human Resources, Minister responsible for the Public Service Commission, and Minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women Act. When Rodney MacDonald took over as premier in February 2006, he named Bolivar-Getson as Minister of Environment and Labour. Following her re-election in 2006, Bolivar-Getson was shuffled to Minister of Immigration. She was given an additional role in cabinet in September 2007 when she was named the first Minister of Seniors. In October 2007, Bolivar-Getson was dropped as Minister of Immigration, retaining roles in cabinet as Minister of Human Resources, Minister of Seniors, and Minister of Emergency Management. In January 2009, Bolivar-Getson was named Minister of Natural Resources. In the 2009 election, Bolivar-Getson was defeated by New Democrat Gary Ramey. In 2012, Bolivar-Getson returned to municipal politics, winning a council seat in the Municipality of the District of Lunenburg."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Edward Mallet (2 December 1862 – 21 November 1947), was a British historian and Liberal politician. He was knighted in 1917. He first stood for parliament at the 1900 General Election when he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Conservative seat of Salford West. Mallet was returned to Parliament for Plymouth in 1906. In 1908 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Walter Runciman who was President of the Board of Education. In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932). His book on Lloyd George was entirely devoted to the shortcomings of the Liberal Leader."

  "text" : "Charles Cecil Cotes (7 April 1846 – 9 August 1898) was a British landowner and Liberal politician. Cotes was born in 1846, eldest surviving son of John Cotes of Woodcote Hall near Newport, Shropshire (himself a former MP) and his wife Lady Louisa Jenkinson, daughter of Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool, and thus nephew of the former Prime Minister, the 2nd Earl. He was educated at Eton College, then entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1864, graduating as B.A. in 1869. Cotes served in the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry as lieutenant before being promoted captain in 1869. This regiment amalgamated to form the unified Shropshire Yeomanry in 1872, and he continued to serve with them until he retired in 1880. Cotes first sought election to Parliament for the then two-member borough seat of Shrewsbury at a by-election following the death of William Clement in 1870 and polled 1,253 votes but was defeated by a majority of 38 by his Conservative opponent, Douglas Straight. Cotes petitioned against the result but the case was dismissed in court with costs. He entered Parliament for Shrewsbury at the 1874 general election, and held the seat until 1885. That year Shrewsbury was reduced to a one-member seat and Cotes did not seek further election to Parliament. When the Liberals came to power in 1880 under William Ewart Gladstone, he was appointed a Junior Lord of the Treasury, which he remained until the government fell in 1885. Following his father's death in 1874, Cotes succeeded to his estates in Shropshire and Staffordshire in England and Montgomeryshire in Wales, which in 1876 amounted to 6,470 acres with an income of £8.860 a year. He had Woodcote Hall rebuilt after a disastrous fire. He reputedly owned the first motor car registered in Shropshire, vehicle registration number \"AW1\". Cotes was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire and at the time of his death was a trustee of the Harper Adams Agricultural College which was then being erected near Newport. Cotes died suddenly at Woodcote Hall, of a heart attack, in August 1898, aged 52, and was buried on 12 August in Woodcote churchyard. He was unmarried and his estates passed to his brother."

Bilyk was elected to serve a six-year term in the Senate at the 2007 federal election, after being placed in the third position on the Australian Labor Party's Tasmanian ticket. She was elected to the sixth Senate seat for Tasmania, on preferences distributed from Andrew Wilkie, the Australian Greens' second candidate for the Senate in Tasmania in the 2007 election. It was second time lucky for Bilyk, who had also been preselected in third spot on the Labor Senate ticket in Tasmania at the 2001 federal election, but failed to win a seat. Bilyk was born in Hobart. She worked as an industrial officer for trade unions and has been ALP National Vice-President. Bilyk is linked with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). She has worked as a nurse and a child carer. She is married with two adult children. In March 2008, she was diagnosed with two benign brain tumours, which were surgically removed. On 27 February 2016, Catryna Bilyk announced that she now supports marriage equality. Now a majority of Senators within the Australian Senate support marriage equality."

He is vice-president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, an opposition party in the Parliament of Malaysia. He formerly served as information chief of the party. Tian Chua first burst into the limelight in 1999 when images of him sitting defiantly in front of a police water cannon truck were splashed across the global media during the height of the Reformasi movement in Malaysia due to the sacking of Anwar Ibrahim as Deputy Prime Minister. Between 27 and 30 September 1999, Tian Chua and six other activists, including Keadilan leaders; Youth leader Mohd Ezam Mohd Nor, Mohamed Azmin Ali and Dr Badrul Amin Baharun; were arrested and as a result prevented from contesting in the 1999 general elections. Further arrests were made on 10 April 2001 and those arrested were subsequently charged and incarcerated under the Internal Security Act. They became known as the Reformasi 10. In the 2008 general elections, Tian Chua contested in the Batu parliamentary constituency in Kuala Lumpur and won, defeating Barisan Nasional's Lim Si Pin (son of former national president of Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia Lim Keng Yaik) with a 9,455 majority."

Molloy first entered Queensland state parliament as one of a number of newly elected Labor MPs following the party's landslide win at the 2001 state election. She was subsequently re-elected at the 2004 state election. In 2006, Molloy publicly opposed her party's policy to build a dam on the Mary River. This stance resulted in her disendorsement as a Labor Party candidate in June 2006. She continued to sit as a Labor MP before quitting the party in August 2006. Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election. The following year, Molloy unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Wide Bay, also in an independent capacity. In the 2009 state election, she unsuccessfully re-contested Noosa. Molloy was born in East Melbourne, Victoria. She was married to Ivan Molloy, who was the endorsed Labor candidate for Fairfax at the 2004 federal election."

The second son of Sir James Charles Mathew, a Lord Justice of Appeal, Charles James Mathew was educated at The Oratory School, Edgbaston, Birmingham and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1897 and took silk in 1913, specialising in Chancery cases. He was also an expert in trade union law. A member of the London County Council since 1910, Mathew was also a member of the Statutory Committee on War Pensions and Chairman of the Special Grants Committee. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1917. Mathew's political views had moved steadily closer to the Labour Party, and he was selected by the party to fight the Whitechapel and St. George's constituency at the 1922 General Election. At the poll, he defeated the incumbent Liberal MP, James Kiley by just 428 votes. Mathew died, aged 50, after an operation, less than two months after his election, becoming one of the shortest-serving MPs in history. At the subsequent by-election Harry Gosling held the seat for Labour. A Roman Catholic, he married in 1896, Anna, daughter of James Cassidy, of Monasterevin, County Kildare. There were two sons and a daughter. His elder son, Sir Theobald Mathew, later became the Director of Public Prosecutions."

He was one of thirteen children of William Wright, bookmaker of Tyldesley, near Manchester. At the age of nine he began work as a \"piecer\" in a local cotton mill. The only education he received was by attending night schools. At the age of fifteen he became a spinner, and rose to become manager of the mill in 1830. In 1841 he became manager of Ormerod and Hardcastles Mill, Bolton.In 1845 he established his own cotton-spinning business in partnership with Henry Barton. In 1855 the partnership was dissolved, and Caleb Wright and Company, Barnfield Mills, Tyldesley, established. Wright was a Unitarian, a member of the congregation at Chowbent Chapel where he succeeded his father as organist. Wright became involved in Liberal politics, and was chairman of Tyldesley Local Board and president of the local Mechanics' Institute. In the 1885 general election Caleb Wright was invited to stand as the candidate for the newly created Leigh division by the Liberal party. His Tory opponent was Lees Knowles who polled 3,725 votes as against 4,261 for Wright. He was elected as the first member of parliament for the new constituency of Leigh. He was re-elected at the next two general elections, before retiring from parliament in 1895. Politically Wright was an advanced radical, and supported both Home Rule for Ireland and women's suffrage. He was also a member of the Liberation Society which sought the disestablishment of the Church of England. Caleb Wright died at his home, Lower Oak, in Shakerley, Tyldesley in 1898 aged 87. He was a Unitarian and is buried at Chowbent Chapel."

  "text" : "Christine Mary Robertson (born 5 October 1948) is an Australian politician and former Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, serving from 2003 until her retirement in 2011. Robertson was born on 5 October 1948 in Wollongong to Walter Edward Carr and Diana Ida McGinness. She attended various primary schools in New South Wales, such as East Tamworth Primary School. She completed her secondary studies at J J Cahill Memorial High School in 1965. She sought a career in nursing and obtained a General Nursing Training Certificate in 1969. She worked as a Registered Nurse at various hospitals including, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Royal South Sydney Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and Tamworth Base Hospital. She pursued further studies in nursing and obtained a Bachelor of Health Science in 1990 from Charles Sturt University. She became a Health Education officer in 1986 and in 1997 became the Manager, and then the Director of Population Health for the New England Area Heath Service. In 1998 she became the Director of the New England Area Health Service Research Institute and in 2003 became the Chair of the Australian Rural Health Research Collaboration Advisory Council. She joined the Tamworth Branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1980. She became the President of the Tamworth Base Hospital Branch of the NSW Nurses Association in the same year. She became its Secretary in 1982 and then its President in 1991, and then the Senior Vice President in 1998. She became a member of the Administrative Committee in 1995. She succeeded Garry Ryan to become the Secretary of the Rural and Provincial Affairs Committee from 1986 to 1990, and then its Chair until 1999, and continued as Chair of the Country Labor Committee. She was a Delegate to the National ALP Conference in 1991 and has been a delegate for every conference thereafter. In 1996 she became the Secretary of the Tamworth Subbranch of the Health Services Union. She is now a partner in a farming and small business. She first stood as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party in the 1995 New South Wales Election when she was unsuccessful in Tamworth which was retained by Independent Tony Windsor. She then stood for the Legislative Council in the 2003 election.She was placed eighth on the Labor Party Group ticket. She received the 16th highest quota at that election, and was elected to serve an eight-year term in the Council. In Parliament she has been a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Threatened Species Conservation Amendment (Biodiversity Banking) Bill 2006, a member of the General Purpose Standing Committee, a member of the Standing Committee on State Development, and a member of the Committee on the Health Care Complaints Commission. She was appointed a Temporary Chair of Committees in 2003 and held that role until 2007. She was also the Legislative Council Representative on the Council of the University of New England in 2003 and 2004. On 1 August 2004 Robertson was traveling in a car on the road outside of Tingha when a vehicle traveling on the wrong side of the road collided with her vehicle. Passers-by removed her from the car prior to the other car bursting into flames. Ambulance officers transported her to Inverell District Hospital for treatment. Robertson said that she had no memory of the accident, nor of the two weeks after the incident, but praised medical staff for her treatment. She is currently the chair of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice. The committee delivered a report on court proceedings involving children criminal defendants. The committee recommended that the names of children who commit crimes should continue to be suppressed so the \"stigma of being associated with a crime\" would not get in the way of the child’s future rehabilitation In 2008, Robertson came out in support of besieged Federal politician Belinda Neal signing an open letter with eight other female politicians condemning the media over their treatment of Neal. On the first day of the new Rees Government, she asked a Dorothy Dixer question but addressed it to the wrong Government Minister. She is married to Richard and has two sons. The media attempted to implicate her when her husband allegedly cut down trees without authority on their country property with the Sydney Daily Telegraph disrespecting her husband by calling him her partner instead of her husband."

  "text" : "Telfer serves on the Bend City Council, and was elected to the Oregon State Senate in the November 2008 elections, to succeed outgoing Senator Ben Westlund. Hers was the only seat that changed parties in the Senate in that election cycle; her campaign spent $300,000 to opponent Maren Lundgren's $12,000. The shift, however, left Democrats with an 18-12 majority, allowing them to pass increases to taxes and fees without Republican support. (A 1996 law requires a 3/5 supermajority in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly for such measures.) Telfer has lived in Bend since 1977. She has two daughters. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Denver, and did post-graduate work at Franklin University and the University of Oregon. She has taught at Central Oregon Community College and served as vice-chair on the Bend Development Board. In 2010, Telfer filed for the special election for Oregon State Treasurer, to complete the term of Ben Westlund, who died in office, but lost to Democratic incumbent Ted Wheeler in the November general election. In the Republican primary of the 2012 legislative elections, Telfer was defeated by Tim Knopp, a former state Representative and vice president of the Central Oregon Builders Association. She became the Oregon Lottery Commissioner. In 2016, she is running for the nomination of the Independent Party of Oregon's nomination for Treasurer of Oregon. She is expected to be that party's first nominee for a statewide office."

Hogan previously worked as Chief Counsel to Vice President Biden during his time in the United States Senate and served as Staff Director of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1995, she assisted with the drafting of anti-terrorism legislation. She has experience with judicial nominations. During the confirmation process for Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, she was (metaphorically) Judge Sotomayor's sherpa. She holds a B.A. in art history from Oberlin College (1979), and a J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School (1984). She was Notes Editor of the Virginia Law Review, then a clerk for U.S. District Court judge Edward Norman Cahn in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. She was an associate at Williams & Connolly, before going to work for Biden (1991–1996). She advised Biden unofficially while she stayed home raising her children. She and her husband both contributed to Democratic National Committee (1992). She gave money to Ralph Neas (1997) in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat Connie Morella in Maryland's 8th congressional district. Her husband has consistently donated to his employer's (the Arent Fox law firm) political action committee; the firm appears to contribute to the party of the incumbent President of the United States."

  "text" : "(For other people named Charles Harrison, see Charles Harrison (disambiguation).) Charles Harrison (1 August 1835 – 24 December 1897) was a British Liberal Party politician. Harrison was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, and was the third son of Frederick Harrison, a stockbroker, and his wife, Jane Brice. He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. In 1858 he entered business as a solicitor at the firm of his uncle, also named Charles Harrison. He acquired a large practice in his own right, with major clients being the London Chatham and Dover Railway and the Law Fire Insurance Society. He became an advocate of the rights of tenants to purchase their properties and of the provision of housing for the working classes. In this he was in agreement with the policies of the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. In 1886 he married Lady Harriet Barlow. His active involvement with politics came with the creation of the London County Council in 1889. He was elected as one of the council's first members, representing Bethnal Green South West as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party. He was a leading member of the council, and vice-chairman from 1892 – 1895. His interests in the government of the capital led him to call for the municipalisation of the London docks and the unification of the City of London with the county. On two occasions Harrison stood for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons on behalf of the Liberals. In 1892 he failed to be elected at Plymouth. He stood again at the ensuing general election in 1895, and became one of the town's two members of parliament, while continuing to hold his seat on the London County Council. Harrison became suddenly ill with inflammation of the throat at the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood on 23 December 1897 and died at his London home on the following day from heart failure."

  "text" : "Charles Harrison (1830 - 11 May 1888) was a British businessman and Liberal politician. He was the younger son of Benjamin Harrison of Liverpool and his wife, Hannah King of Stourbridge. Harrison entered business with Mr B Devey, a wharfinger at Stourport-on-Severn. Among the goods that were dealt with on the wharf were locally produced carpets of George Harris. On Harris's retirement Harrison purchased his carpet manufacturing business, and continued to actively run the company until shortly before his death. Apart from his business activities, Harrison was a magistrate for Worcestershire and a member of the Stourport local board and a number of other institutions in the area. In 1874 he was invited to stand as Liberal candidate for the parliamentary borough of Bewdley in place of Augustus Anson who had retired from parliament. Harrison held the seat for the Liberals, defeating his Conservative opponent Stanley Leighton by 514 votes to 405. At the ensuing general election in 1880 Harrison was re-elected, defeating K E Webster by 598 votes to 530. However, Harrison was unseated on petition, and retired from parliamentary politics. Harrison made his home at Areley Court, Areley Kings, near Stourport. He married Elizabeth Augusta Kempson of Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1858. He died at his home in May 1888 after a long illness."

  "text" : "Chantal Jouanno (born 12 July 1969 in Vernon, Eure, France) is a French politician. She was Minister of Sports in the third government of François Fillon from 14 November 2010 and 26 September 2011, succeeding to Roselyne Bachelot and being replaced by David Douillet, before taking office as senator on 1 October 2011. She had previously been Minister for Ecology in the second French Government of François Fillon from 21 January 2009 (she replaced Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet) to 14 November 2010. She was a close ally of president Sarkozy and former president of ADEME. During the 2012 Presidential election, Jouanno suggested if she had to choose between a Socialist candidate and a National Front one, she would vote Socialist. This comment was interpreted by Sarkozy supporters such as Francois Fillon as being critical of Sarkozy's attempts to woo National Front supporters. In October 2012, she announced leaving the UMP party to join the newly created centre-right party UDI, led by Jean-Louis Borloo, as vice-president. She is a former karate champion, being a twelve-time French champion in her category. On 7 March 2010, she became karate French Team Champion together with her teammates Véronique Mesnil De Vido and Léna Pyrée."

He was imprisoned many times during the freedom struggle. He hailed from Shakurpur Village, a yadav dominated village in North-West Delhi. In the post-independence era, Prakash, a member of India's yadav community, served as Minister in charge of Planning and Development as well as the first Chief Minister of Delhi from 1952-55. His stints in the Parliament twice won him accolades as an able parliamentarian. He also made noteworthy contributions as the Union Cabinet Minister for Food, Agriculture, Irrigation and Cooperatives. The cause of depressed sections of the society, rural development and empowerment of the weaker sections were issues which were very close to the heart of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash. He was quick to realise the potential of cooperative societies in mitigating the hardships of the village folks. As early as in 1945, he started organising village and agriculture cooperatives. He was also a proponent of the Panchayati Raj institutions. He organised the National Union of Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities in 1977 to work for the welfare of these weaker sections."

As U.S. Attorney, Turner investigated sham marriages and immigration fraud organized by followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now known as Osho) in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, as well as other illegal activities including the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. In 1985, high-ranking followers of Rajneesh plotted to murder Turner, carrying out steps including assembling a team, purchasing weapons, and performing surveillance on his office, home and car. Seven followers of Rajneesh were later convicted of conspiracy to assassinate him. While U.S. Attorney, Turner hired prosecutors Michael Mosman and Mark Bailey; both would later go on to serve as U.S. Attorney for Oregon. He retired in 1993, and was succeeded by Kristine Olson, who he had previously supervised as U.S. Attorney."

Picquet joined the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR) in 1968, but left the party in 1971 to join a smaller internationalist communist party. He rejoined the LCR in 1980 and was elected to the LCR's Politburo in 1984. As a member of the Politburo, he was responsible for the party's relations with other left-wing parties in France, and he developed the LCR's first relations with the larger French Communist Party (PCF). Picquet was a member of the \"Unir\" movement within the LCR, which favoured at first close ties with other left-wing parties such as the French Communist Party rather than far left parties, before calling on the creation of a common party of the left with the PCF. This faction, known as Unir was a minority faction within the LCR and disappeared with the creation of the New Anticapitalist Party, the LCR's successor party. In 2009, at the creation of the New Anticapitalist Party, he founded the Unitarian Left with a part of Unir minority. The Unitarian Left joined the PCF-led Left Front. He was selected to be the third candidate on the Left Front's list in the Île-de-France constituency ahead of the 2009 European elections."

  "text" : "Charles Carroll (1661–1720), sometimes called Charles Carroll the Settler to differentiate him from his son and grandson, was a wealthy lawyer and planter in colonial Maryland. Carroll, a Catholic, is best known because his efforts to hold office in the Protestant-dominated colony (of Maryland) resulted in the disfranchisement of the colony's Catholics. The second son of Irish Catholic parents, Carroll was educated in France as a lawyer before returning to England, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as Attorney General of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder George Calvert and his descendants intended it as a refuge for Catholics. Carroll supported Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following the overthrow of the Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence."

Almost a decade later, December 15, 2005, BART Director Ward Allen attained another major milestone as a woman in politics when she was elected among her colleagues on the BART Board of Directors to serve as its president and Lynette Sweet as its vice president, which made BART the first major transportation agency to be led by two African-American women in American history."

  "text" : "C. M. Stephen (23 December 1918 – 16 January 1984) was an Indian politician and Union Minister Republic of India. C.M.Stephen was born on 23 December 1918 to Eapen Mathai and Esther of Chembakassery house in Cherukole, Mavelikkara. During his school days, Stephen was active in the Balajanasakhyam (promoted by Malayala Manorama). This helped him to develop leadership qualities, oratorial and organizing skills. After completing B L, Stephen, started his career as a journalist. He also started 'Pouraprabha' an evening daily. Through this daily he supported the Travancore Congress and attacked the rule of C.P.Ramaswamy Iyyer. In 1949, he gave up his career as a journalist and started practising law. In 1951, he joined active politics and in the same year became the D C C president of Kollam. He was a close associate of veteran Congress leaders P.T.Chacko, Pattom Thanu Pillai and R. Sankar and provided leadership in the Vimochana Samaram during 1958-59 period as an associate of P.T.Chacko, Pattom Thanu Pillai, R.Sankar and others. He was also one of the founding fathers of I N T U C, the trade union wing of the Indian National Congress. He won the State elections in 1960, 1965 and 1971. He was also elected as an MP from Idukki in the 1976 parliamentary elections. He was a close aide of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party - Indira faction during 1978-79. C. M. Stephen also served in the Union Cabinet under Indira Gandhi, most notably as the Union Minister for Communications. Shashi Tharoor in his 'India: From Midnight to the Millennium' quotes Stephen's statement in Parliament that \"the telephone was a luxury and not a necessity\" as symptomatic of India's failure to invest in infrastructure and communications before the Reforms of 1991. Dharam Singh gave up the Gulbarga Lok Sabha seat to accommodate C. M. Stephen, the then Union Home Minister in the Indira Gandhi Cabinet, after he lost the election in Delhi to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. C. M. Stephen was buried at the St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, Mavelikkara."

  "text" : "Charles Tyrrell (1776–2 January 1872) was a British Tory politician. He was born the son of Charles Tyrell, vicar of Thurston, Suffolk and educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He married twice; \n*  firstly Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Richard Ray of Plashwood, with whom he had two sons and three daughters and  \n*  secondly Mary Anne, the daughter of John Matthews of Wargrave, Berkshire and the widow of Thomas William Cooke of Polstead. His first wife brought him the Plashwood estate near Haughley, Suffolk which he made his home. He was appointed Sheriff of Suffolk in 1815 and elected to the House of Commons at the 1830 general election as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Suffolk. He was re-elected for the same constituency in the 1831. When that constituency was divided by the Reform Act for the 1832 general election, Tyrrell was returned for the new Western division of Suffolk. He did not stand again at the 1835 general election. He died at Plashwood in 1872 at the age of 96 and was buried at Haughley."

Calvert worked to reassert the Proprietary interest against the privileges of the colonists as set out in the Maryland Charter, and to ease tensions between the Lords Baltimore and their subjects. Religious tension, which had been a source of great division in the colony, was much reduced under his governorship. Captain Calvert was replaced as governor in 1727 by his cousin Benedict Leonard Calvert, though he continued to occupy other colonial offices. He suffered from early senility and died in 1734."

Cui was born in what is today Huangshan City, Anhui Province. The details of his life are not well known beyond a diary that he wrote chronicling his time as Minister. Cui has generally not been a well-regarded figure in historical accounts. Liang Jian, a historian at Yunnan Normal University, writes that \"because he could not speak English, had an introverted personality, and was inept at social intercourse, [Cui] became the butt of jokes and a gossip topic\". Historian Michael Hunt believes that Cui was \"a lackluster diplomat\", because he did not consistently advocate for concrete policies that would assist Chinese citizens living in the United States following the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882."

She later served on the Michigan Association of School Boards Taxation Committee,. Saltonstall was elected to the Charlevoix County Commission in 2006, and served a three-year term on the Charlevoix County Commission on Aging. She unsuccessfully sought election to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008. In March 2010, Saltonstall announced that she would challenge incumbent Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak. Saltonstall cited Stupak's authoring of the anti-abortion Stupak–Pitts Amendment to the proposed Affordable Health Care for America Act, as well as Stupak's disagreement with changes made to the amendment by the U.S. Senate. She has received vocal support from the abortion rights groups, NARAL and the National Organization of Women. NOW President Terry O’Neill told POLITICO, “I think Connie Saltonstall is going to be our next representative from Michigan's first district.” Stupak has since announced that he will not run for re-election. In May 2010, Saltonstall ended her candidacy after party establishment decided to back another candidate."

After studying at Lincoln's Inn he was admitted to the bar in England. He married Miss Mary Ann Hayward from Sussex in 1859. She died in Wellington on 18 July 1900 aged 71 years. In 1860 they emigrated to Auckland, and that year moved to Wellington. He was a Crown solicitor and partner in the law firm that became Bell Gully. His son, Charles Hayward Izard, was a partner in that firm from 1882 to 1897. He was on the boards of local schools and local companies e.g. the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company and the Meat Export Company. He retired from the law in 1887 due to failing eyesight. He contested the 1881 election in the Foxton electorate, where he was second of six candidates, beaten by James Wilson. He represented the Wellington South and Suburbs electorate from 1887 to 1890, when he was defeated (for the Hutt electorate). His son Charles Hayward Izard was also a Member of Parliament."

  "text" : "Charles Wykeham-Martin DL (11 September 1801 – October 1870) was an English Conservative Party politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1841 and 1870. Martin was born Charles Wykeham the son of Fiennes Wykeham of Leeds Castle Maidstone and his wife Eliza Bignell, daughter of R. Bignell. He was educated at Eton College and at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1821 his father assumed the additional name of Martin. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries, a corresponding member of the Academy d'Archeologie de Belgique, and a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. He was also a lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd Battalion Kent Volunteers and a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Kent and a J.P. for Hampshire. Martin stood for parliament unsuccessfully at Newport (Isle of Wight) in 1837 but was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newport in 1841. He lost the seat at Newport in 1852 and stood unsuccessfully at Maidstone in 1853. He was elected MP for West Kent at a by-election in 1857 as a Liberal but lost the seat in 1859. At the 1865 general election he was elected MP for Newport again and re-elected in 1868 when representation was reduced to one member. He held the seat until his death in 1870. Martin died at the age of 69. Martin married firstly in 1828, Lady Jemima Isabella Cornwallis, daughter of James Mann, 5th Earl Cornwallis. She died in 1836 and he married secondly in 1838, Matilda Trollope daughter of Sir John Trollope, 6th Baronet. His son Philip was MP for Rochester.

  "text" : "Charles Henry Gartrell (July 28, 1914 - July 3, 1988) was an American state and municipal officer from Ashland, Kentucky. Educated in private schools, he graduated from Centre College in Danville. Gartrell joined the United States Navy in June 1942 and served as a test pilot during World War II. Gartrell was a member of the Freemasons, Shriners, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Sons of the American Revolution. A Democrat, Gartrell was one of the five candidates for the office of Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1947, but lost to Lawrence Wetherby. As the first commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Aeronautics from 1948 to 1956, Gartrell often flew the governor and senators around the state. In this capacity, he helped to build many local airports to stimulate both tourism and economic development. Gartrell was mayor of Ashland from 1968 to 1972 and later an administrative supervisor in the Kentucky Department of Human Resources. Gartrell died in 1988 and was buried in Ashland Cemetery."

  "text" : "Chumpol Silpa-archa (Thai: ชุมพล ศิลปอาชา, rtgs: Chumphon Sinlapa-a-cha; 6 June 1940 – 21 January 2013) was a Thai politician who served in the government of Thailand as Minister of Tourism and Sports from 2008 to 2013; he was also Deputy Prime Minister from 2011 to 2013. Beginning in January 2009, he was the president of the Chartthaipattana Party. He was the younger brother of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa. Born at Suphanburi, Chumpol held a Bachelor of Laws from the Thammasat University and an MPA from the Syracuse University. He worked as a civil servant and political science lecturer at the Thammasat University, before he entered politics in 1979. A member of the conservative-populist Thai Nation Party, he represented Suphan Buri Province in parliament. In the following years he held different high-rank government positions. In 1986 and 1992, he was Vice President of the House of Representatives. From 1997 to 1998 he was Minister of Education in Chuan Leekpai's cabinet. As he was no member of the Thai Nation Party's executive board, he was, unlike his brother, not banned from political activity by the Constitutional Court's ruling of 2 December 2008. So he could, as his brother's proxy, become leader of the Chartthaipattana Party, which is the de facto successor of the dissolved Thai Nation Party. After his grouping broke the coalition with the People's Power Party and joined the Democrat-led government, Chumpol became Minister of Tourism and Sports under Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. When the Pheu Thai Party led by Yingluck Shinawatra won the 2011 elections, Chumpol changed sides again, and directed his Chartthaipattana Party into the coalition with Pheu Thai. He kept the Tourism and Sports portfolio and was additionally appointed Deputy Prime Minister, on 9 August 2011. Chumpol Silpa-archa has been decorated with the Special Class of both the Order of the White Elephant and the Order of the Crown of Thailand. Chumpol died of heart failure on 21 January 2013, around 09:30 hours, at Ramathibodi Hospital, while holding the offices of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism and Sports."

Craig has since admitted to inappropriate conduct with MacGregor but has denied charges of sexual harassment. On 27 June, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party. Since then, his suspension has been invalidated which would enable Craig to contest the Conservative Party's leadership. On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in lieu of a police investigation against him over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election."

  "text" : "Christopher John \"Chris\" Sumner AM (born 17 April 1943) is a former Australian politician. Sumner, who holds a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Law and was a barrister and solicitor before entering politics, was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council for the Australian Labor Party in 1975. In May 1979 he was appointed 43rd Attorney-General of South Australia and Minister of Prices and Consumer Affairs. In September he became Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council following the government's defeat. When Labor returned to office in 1982 he resumed his previous offices in addition to Ethnic Affairs. In 1983 he added Agriculture, Fisheries and Forests to his responsibilities, and in 1989 exchanged Ethnic Affairs and Consumer Affairs for Crime Provention. In September 1993 he became Minister for Justice and Correctional Services. Labor was defeated in 1993 and Sumner once again led the Opposition in the Legislative Council, holding the shadow portfolios of Attorney-General, Education, Public Sector Reform and Consumer Affairs until his resignation from the Legislative Council in 1994."

  "text" : "Carrol Athelstone Bramich (30 October 1893 – 1 October 1964) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1946 to 1964, representing the electorate of Darwin for both the Labor Party (1946-1956) and the Liberal Party (1956-1964). He served as a minister under Labor Premier Robert Cosgrove until his sudden floor-crossing defection in 1956. Bramich was promoted to Cabinet in November 1946 and was appointed Assistant Minister for Education and Transport, but was defeated in a caucus election for a reshuffle several months later. He returned to Cabinet in May 1948 following the defeat of Rowland Worsley, and was assigned Worsley's former role of Minister for Forests. He again lost his position in a caucus election, and again regained it after another vacancy in April 1949, being appointed Minister for Housing. Bramich suddenly resigned as Minister for Housing and from the Labor Party on 11 September 1956, costing the Labor government its majority in parliament. He claimed that his recommendations were being ignored and his decisions set aside. He was also facing party censure for having, while Acting Minister for Health, made a public statement claiming that his colleagues had \"deliberately frustrated\" his efforts to reconstitute a country hospitals board. Bramich initially claimed that he would sit on the crossbenches, but defected to the Liberal Party later that day. An attempt to install a Liberal government mid-term was only thwarted when Premier Robert Cosgrove called an early election, following a constitutional crisis around whether the Governor would allow him to dissolve parliament. Bramich had been expected to lose his seat at the subsequent election, but instead topped the Liberal poll in his seat. Bramich retired from politics in 1964 and died later that year."

He was appointed Assistant Minister for Health on 3 April 2012, but was expelled from the ministry for breaches of cabinet solidarity. Before entering parliament Dr Davis worked as the director of geriatric medicine at The Prince Charles Hospital. He has served as president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association and was the state chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. On 13 May 2014, Davis was sacked from Cabinet in response to his speaking against the government on a number of matters. Premier Campbell Newman said Davis had failed to observe the convention that cabinet members and assistant ministers are bound by collective decision making. Although Davis initially stated that he intended to retire at the next state election, he resigned from the Parliament on 23 May 2014. A 2014 Stafford by-election was held on Saturday 19 July 2014. On 25 July 2014, in an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Queensland, Davis stated that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party and had spoken to Australian Labor Party state secretary Anthony Chisholm about the potential for continuing his political career with Labor, potentially running in Newman's seat of Ashgrove. The following day, Leader of the Opposition Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Davis was not a member of the Labor Party and would not be running as a Labor candidate. On the same day, Davis submitted his application to join the Labor Party, and also stated that he was interested in federal politics if he was unsuccessful in obtaining a state seat."

He was born in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, the son of the Reverend George James Ayre and Margaret Mary Burgess, and was educated in Bath, Somersetshire and at Hymers College in Hull, Yorkshire. Ayre was the grandson of Newfoundland politician Charles Robert Ayre. He came to Luxembourg, Saskatchewan in 1910 as a student minister, staying there until June 1911 when he moved to Maidstone. Ayre left the ministry in the summer of the following year and moved to Mervin, where he worked in a general store. Ayre established himself as a notary public and also served as a justice of the peace. In 1914, he began work at a store in Turtleford, also working as a notary public and selling insurance. Ayre married Edith Mary Davis in 1915. In 1917, he became the franchise owner for farm equipment sold by International Harvester, McCormick-Deering and Petrolia Wagon Works.

  "text" : "Cuthbert Robert Blackett F.C.S., J.P. (9 October 1831 – 1902), was a Victorian Government Analytical Chemist in colonial Australia. Blackett was the son of the Rev. C. R. Blackett, Independent minister at Southminster, England, where he was born 9 October 1831. Having served his time as a pharmaceutical chemist, he arrived in Melbourne in January 1853, and became a member of the first council of the Pharmaceutical Society, and ultimately its secretary and president. He was also for five years editor of the journal published by that society. On the passing of the Pharmacy Act in 1877, the Government appointed him one of the members of the Pharmacy Board, and on the retirement of Mr. Bosisto he was elected President. He was examiner in chemistry to the College of Pharmacy, and for some time acted as lecturer on chemistry, materia medica, and botany, pending the arrival of Professor A. H. Jackson, B.8o. In 1879 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Fitzroy in the Conservative interest. Mr. Blackett was President of the Royal Technological Commission; and when the Central Board of Health was formed he was offered the position of president, but declined it. In 1882 he was again returned for Fitzroy, but was defeated at the next general election, owing to his pronounced free-trade views. Mr. Blackett was appointed Government Analytical Chemist on the death of Mr. Johnson, in 1887, and is also a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London, and was co-examiner in chemistry to the Melbourne University, until he resigned the office. Mr. Blackett married Miss Margaretta Palmer in May 1870 at Stokesley, England."

He later joined the pro-Beijing pro-business Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA) and reelected to the Provisional Legislative Council in 1996.

  "text" : "Charles Hutchins Stewart (September 22, 1867 – June 18, 1936) was a four-term mayor of Melbourne, Florida from 1890 to 1891, and 1902 to 1905. He was born in Joliet, Illinois on September 22, 1867, the son of William F. Stewart (b. Ohio) and Julia Ann Hutchins (b. Maysville, Kentucky). He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida."

He graduated from Yale College in 1823. After leaving College he began to read law, but from trouble with his eyes was led to engage in farming in his native town, which occupation he afterwards adopted. He became a deacon in the Congregational church of his native town in 1841, and was through life earnestly interested in that church's welfare. In 1846, and again in 1847, and in 1851, he was chosen to the State Senate, and thus became ex officio in the two latter terms a member of the Corporation of Yale College. In 1848 he represented Wilton, Connecticut in the House, and in 1852 was appointed bank commissioner. He had already been for many years one of the directors of the Fairfield County Bank. He died at his ancestral home in Wilton, Conn., December 1, 1883, in his 81st year, after a protracted illness. In November, 1836, he married Clarina, third daughter of the Rev. Samuel Merwin, then of Wilton, who survived him, with three daughters and two sons.  This article incorporates public domain material from the 1884 Yale Obituary Record."

  "text" : "Ahmet Cem Ersever (Erzurum, 1950 - Ankara, 4 November 1993) was a commander in the Turkish Gendarmerie, and said to be one of the founders of the Gendarmerie's JITEM intelligence unit. He was assassinated in November 1993. His girlfriend and translator Nevval Boz was also assassinated, along with İhsan Hakan, a former PKK member. Prior to his assassination, Ersever had left the army and began speaking to the press, and said he was in charge of JITEM's south-eastern operations. In his resignation statement he said \"A gang formed inside the authorized organization in the Southeast is preventing the Turkish nation from seeing the real dimensions of the events taking place there.\" He published a book on the war with the PKK under the pen-name Ahmet Aydın. His interviews with journalist Soner Yalçın were published in Aydınlık, after which the Military Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation, and took a deposition from Ersever. Ersever's archive went missing after his death, but was later found in the house of Veli Küçük during investigations for the Ergenekon trials. A report found in Küçük's house suggested that journalist Uğur Mumcu, General Eşref Bitlis and Ersever had all been killed to cover up arms sales from the Ergenekon organization to armed Kurdish groups. He was declared a \"martyr\" by the Turkish Gendarmerie in 2011. Doğu Perinçek has claimed that Ersever was assassinated to cover up his role in the assassination of Eşref Bitlis earlier that year. A report in the 1990s by police chief Hanefi Avcı said that Ersever had been killed by Mahmut Yıldırım (codename Yeşil) on the orders of Veli Küçük."

The family lived first in Hutchinson, where they owned a cheese factory and Charles McEwen held local office in McLeod County, and later in Boon Lake, where they set up the first cheese factory in Renville County. An abolitionist and a member of the Home Guard, McEwen was elected to the House of Representatives in 1892. Following his death, his son Bowman maintained the family farm, and served on the Renville County Commission. In 1906, Bowman's daughter Sarah moved with her husband Max Ramsland to Canora, Saskatchewan. Max was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1917, but died after less than a year in office during the 1918 flu pandemic; Sarah was then elected to the legislature as his successor, becoming the first woman ever to serve in Saskatchewan's provincial legislature."

  "text" : "Cornelius \"Con\" Botha (18 September 1932 – 6 February 2014) was a South African politician and the last administrator of the Natal Province. Born in Upington in the Northern Cape, Botha grew up in Parys in the Free State province. He graduated from Stellenbosch University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He became a member of the former National Party and held the Umlazi constituency until 1990, when he was appointed administrator of its province. The position was dissolved in 1994 with the province's redesignation into KwaZulu-Natal following re-incorporation of the KwaZulu bantustan. He was briefly a member of the Democratic Party (South Africa). In 2009, Botha's wife Leonore died. In 2014, he was admitted to a hospital for gastroenteritis. Botha's condition worsened and he died from heart failure at the age of 81 in February 2014. He and Leonore were survived by two daughters."

A Democrat, Clayton Klein was first elected to the Oregon Legislature in November 1976, taking office in January 1977. During his first term, he argued in favor of legislation, which ultimately did not pass, that would have lowered the legal drinking age from 21 to 18. A few years earlier, while attending Southern Oregon College, he had been co-leader of a student group pushing to place on the ballot a measure asking Oregon voters to make that change. Klein was reelected in November 1978 to a second two-year term. In January 1979, he was elected House majority whip by his fellow legislators. He ran again for the seat in 1980, but was defeated in the November general election by Republican Rebecca DeBoer."
