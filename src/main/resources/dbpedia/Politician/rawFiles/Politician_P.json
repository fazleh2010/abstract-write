  "text" : "Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Classical Latin: [ˈgnae̯.ʊs pɔmˈpɛj.jʊs ˈmaŋ.nʊs]; 29 September 106 BC – 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey /ˈpɒmpiː/ or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname Magnus, \"the Great\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. In mid-60 BC, Pompey joined Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gaius Julius Caesar in the unofficial military-political alliance known as the First Triumvirate, which Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter Julia helped secure. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus, Pompey sided with the optimates, the conservative faction of the Roman Senate. Pompey and Caesar then contended for the leadership of the Roman state, leading to a civil war. When Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, he sought refuge in Egypt, where he was assassinated. His career and defeat are significant in Rome's subsequent transformation from Republic to Empire."

  "text" : "Peter Robert Garrett AM (born 16 April 1953) is an Australian musician, environmentalist, activist and former politician. Garrett is the lead singer of the Australian rock band Midnight Oil. He served as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation for ten years and, in 2003, was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to the environment and music industry. He was the Australian Labor Party member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Kingsford Smith, New South Wales, from October 2004 to August 2013. After the Labor Party won in the November 2007 election, Garrett was appointed Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. On 8 March 2010, his portfolio title was changed to Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. He continued in this role in Julia Gillard's first Ministry. He was re-elected at the 2010 election and was appointed Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. He was sworn into this portfolio on 14 September 2010 as a member of the Second Gillard Ministry, and following a leadership spill in the Australian Labor Party, Garrett resigned his position as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth and moved to the backbench. He later announced that he would not be contesting his seat at the next federal election. Garrett became a Member of the Order of Australia in 2003 \"For service to the community as a prominent advocate for environmental conservation and protection, and to the music industry.\" In 2009, the French Government appointed Garrett an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters. In 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature presented him with their Leaders for a Living Planet award."

He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, working on issues of international economic development, Africa and public-private partnerships, and chairman of the US-Taiwan Business Council. He is considered to be a leading neoconservative. However, Wolfowitz rejects the term and prefers to call himself a \"Scoop Jackson Republican,\" after Democratic U.S. senator Henry M. Jackson who was known for his hawkish views on foreign policy. After serving two years, he resigned as president of the World Bank Group due to scandals described by a Reuters report as \"a protracted battle over his stewardship, prompted by his involvement in a high-paying promotion for his companion\". He was reportedly the model for a minor character named Philip Gorman in Saul Bellow's 2001 book Ravelstein."

  "text" : "Count Per Brahe the Younger (18 February 1602 – 2 September 1680) was a Swedish soldier and statesman. He was a Privy Councillor from 1630 and Lord High Steward from 1640. Brahe was born on Rydboholm (now in Österåker Municipality) in Uppland. He was the grandson of Per Brahe the Elder (1520–1590), one of Gustavus Vasa's Privy Councillors, created count of Visingsborg by King Eric XIV, known also as the continuator of Peder Svart's chronicle of Gustavus, and author of Oeconomia in 1585, a manual for young noblemen. Per Brahe the younger, after completing his education by several years’ travel abroad, became in 1626 chamberlain to Gustavus Adolphus, whose lasting friendship he gained. He fought with distinction in Prussia during the last three years of the Polish War (1626–1629) and also, as colonel of a regiment of horse, in 1630 in Germany. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632 his military yielded to his political activity. He had been elected president or Lantmarskalk in the Riksdag of 1629, and in the following year was created a Privy Councillor. In 1635 he conducted the negotiations for an armistice with Poland (Treaty of Stuhmsdorf). In 1637–1640 and again in 1648–1654 he was Governor General in Finland, to which country he rendered inestimable services by his wise and provident rule. He reformed the whole administration, introduced a postal system, founded ten new towns, improved and developed commerce and agriculture, and very greatly promoted education. In 1640 he opened the Royal Academy of Turku, of which he was the founder, and first chancellor. Still today the expression \"Kreivin aikaan\", or \"at Count's Time\" in the Finnish language means \"at the correct/good time\". The base of his statue in Turku bears the inscription \"I was well pleased with the land and the land with me\". After the death of King Charles X in 1660, Brahe, as Lord High Steward, became one of the regents of Sweden for the second time (he had held a similar office during the minority of Queen Christina, 1632–1644), and during the difficult year 1660 he had entire control of both foreign and domestic affairs. He died on 2 September 1680 at his castle Bogesund in Uppland. He also held the castles Visingsborg at Visingsö and Brahehus on the mainland by Gränna, where during his lifetime he had held more than regal pomp. The town of Raahe (Swedish: Brahestad) in Finland is named after him."

  "text" : "Philip Francis Little (1824 – October 21, 1897) was the first Premier of Newfoundland Colony between 1855 and 1858. He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law. He got involved in politics only a few years after. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony's Attorney-General. Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858, when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent. In that time, he managed to secure Newfoundland's autonomy, in making sure Newfoundland had a say over its own destiny. Then Britain and France came with a plan involving the west coast of Newfoundland. Little objected and in a dispatch in 1857, the British cancelled the deal which would have been unfavourable to Newfoundland. He resigned in 1858 saying \"I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me\". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. Little was appointed as appointed assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. He married into a wealthy Anglo-Irish family in 1864 and retired to Ireland in 1868 and did a great deal for the home rule movement there. He died at the age of 73 in 1897 while living in Monkstown, Ireland. He married Mary Jane Holdright in 1864 and they had 13 children. Their youngest child Patrick Little was a senior Irish politician."

He was the penultimate Prime Minister of the Third Republic and vice-president of the Democratic Republican Alliance center-right party. After the outbreak of war and the collapse of French resistance in 1940, Reynaud persistently refused to support an armistice with Germany and resigned. After unsuccessfully attempting to flee France, he was arrested by Philippe Petain's administration. Surrendered to German custody in 1942, he was imprisoned in Germany and later Austria until liberation in 1945. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946, he became a prominent figure again in French political life, serving in several cabinet positions. He favoured a United States of Europe, and participated in drafting the constitution for the Fifth Republic, but resigned from government in 1962 after disagreement with President de Gaulle over changes to the electoral system."

  "text" : "Peter Glotz (6 March 1939 – 25 August 2005) was a German social democratic politician (Social Democratic Party) and social scientist. Glotz was born in Eger, Sudetenland (now Cheb, Czech Republic), to a German father and a Czech mother. His father, an insurance-clerk joined the Nazi Party and administered a small \"aryanized\" Jewish factory in Prague. His family fled from Czechoslovakia in September 1945 and settled in Franconia. He studied Journalism, Philosophy, Germanistics, and Sociology at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich and the University of Vienna, and became a doctor of philosophy in 1968. Glotz became director of the Ludwig Maximilians University in 1969 and a member of the Landtag of Bavaria in 1970. He was a member of the German parliament from 1972 to 1977 and a parliamentary state secretary of the Federal Minister for Education and Research from 1974 until 1977. From 1977 to 1981 Glotz was a senator for science and research in the state of Berlin, and became a member of the parliament again in 1983, resigning in 1996. He was secretary general of the SPD from 1981 to 1987. Glotz then became founding director of the University of Erfurt (1996 - 1999) and professor for communication sciences. From January 2000 until his death in Zürich, Glotz was a Professor for media and society at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. In 2002, he was a representative of the German Chancellor to the European Convention. With Erika Steinbach, he was chairman of the Centre Against Expulsions foundation."

  "text" : "Peter Ernest Hume (born June 19, 1963) was a city councillor in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He represented Alta Vista Ward in the south end of the city. He was considered by some to have been \"the most respected politician in Ottawa\". Hume grew up in the Canterbury area of Alta Vista Ward. He attended Hawthorne Public School and Canterbury High School before graduating with a degree in Economics from Carleton University. He would then work as an assistant to Canterbury Ward councillor Michael McSweeney and then Alta Vista Ward councillor Darrel Kent. Hume was first elected as a city and regional councillor in 1991. In 1994 he was elected to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton council (when it became an independently elected position). He was re-elected in 1997. In the 2000 Ottawa election, he chose to run against Ottawa city councillor Allan Higdon for city council, as the City of Ottawa and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton were set to amalgamate the following year. He was able to defeat Higdon, and was acclaimed three years later in the 2003 Ottawa election. In 2002, Hume contributed $362.26 to the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership campaign of Jim Flaherty. Hume is generally considered to be a \"red Tory\", who \"votes in favour of social spending, but talks convincingly about fiscal responsibility.\" In 2004, Hume allowed a private developer to hold a private party to raise money to pay off a debt Hume had received from running for President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Both Hume and the host of the party has refused to reveal the guest list to that event. Hume would later serve as President from 2008 to 2011. Hume was easily re-elected in the 2006 municipal elections with 70% of the vote and again in 2010 with 59% of the vote. Hume is currently the Chair of the City of Ottawa's Planning Committee, a position he has held since 2003. On August 22, 2014, Hume announced he would not be seeking re-election as councillor. In 2015, Hume partnered with former Minto vice-president, Jack Stirling, in a \"strategic partnership to pursue development projects and to advise both the private and public sector.\" Stirling, the old City of Nepean’s last planning commissioner before amalgamation, is well-known as another former local bureaucrat who jumped the fence in 2001 to work for Minto as vice-president of development, using his experience to stickhandle development proposals through the city’s Byzantine approvals process."

On 13 September 2010, she was sworn in as Minister for Finance and Deregulation in the Gillard Government.

  "text" : "Ploutis Servas (Πλουτής Σέρβας in Greek; 22 May 1907 – 14 February 2001), was a Cypriot former politician, reporter, and author. Servas was born Ploutarhos Loizou Savvidis (Πλούταρχος Λοΐζου Σαββίδης) and changed his surname to Servas while still a student in secondary education. Servas was born in Limassol, Cyprus in 1907. He studied social sciences in Moscow. He returned to Cyprus in the 1930s and had to sign a declaration saying he would not be involved in politics in order to be allowed to set foot in the country. He became the general secretary of the illegal Communist party of Cyprus and founder and first general secretary of AKEL (1941–1945). He was also the first elected Mayor of Limassol 1943–1946 and 1946–1949. As a mayor he participated in the consultative assembly and advocated accepting the British plan of self-government for Cyprus in 1948. For that opinion he became isolated within his party and was expelled in 1952. He supported Ioannis Clerides in the 1960 elections, but wasn't an active politician again himself. He worked mainly as a reporter and a writer. He wrote books such as: Spain on Fire (1936), The Labour Issue (1936), AKEL and Local Issues (1942), Portraits of Palmer's Era (1946), Corea (1949), Prague Spring (1973), How Did We Manage to Get to Zero; The Cypriot Tragedy (1975), Old and New China (1977), Responsibilities (first volume 1980, second volume 1984, third volume 1985). His death on 14 February 2001 caused controversy in Cyprus as in his will he had asked to be cremated. There were no crematoria in Cyprus and there was a heated debate between those supporting the availability of cremation as an alternative and those (mainly religious Orthodox Christians) who disapproved of it."

  "text" : "Pierre-Henri Teitgen (29 May 1908 – 6 April 1997) was a French lawyer, professor and politician. Teitgen was born in Rennes, Brittany. Made prisoner of war in 1940, he played a major role in the French Resistance. Member of French Parliament from 1945 to 1958 for Ille-et-Vilaine, he was president of the Popular Republican Movement (Christian Democratic Party) from 1952 to 1956. He was Minister of Information in 1944 (one of the founders of the daily Le Monde), Minister of Justice in 1945–1946 (in charge of the purges of the Vichy regime followers and collaborators with Nazi Germany), Minister of Defence in 1947–1948 in Robert Schuman's government at the time of the insurrectional strikes. In May 1948 he attended the Congress of The Hague and worked closely with Robert Schuman in Schuman Declaration and the start of the European Community when he was Minister of Information and Civil service in 1949–1950. He was later Minister of Overseas in 1950. He was member of the Constitutional Committee in 1958. He was twice deputy prime minister in 1947–1948 and 1953–1954. He was member of the Consultative Constitutional Committee in 1958 but became a critic of De Gaulle's policies. He supported the Socialist Defferre in his attempt as candidate for presidency in 1965. In September 1976, he was appointed member of the European Court of Human Rights. He had helped to create the court some 27 years earlier, in 1949, outlining its powers and the rights it should protect in a report for the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. Teitgen died in Paris in 1997. Teitgen's father, Henri Teitgen (1882 - 1965), was a senior politician of the centre-right MRP (party)."

  "text" : "Phillip D. \"Phill\" Kline (born December 31, 1959) is a former Kansas state legislator (1992-2000), former district attorney of Johnson County, and the Attorney General of Kansas from January 2003 to January 2007. Kline, a member of the Republican Party, lost re-election as attorney general to Democratic challenger, Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison, on November 7, 2006, 58%-41%. Having been appointed by the Republican County Central Committee over Steve Howe to fill the vacancy left by Paul Morrison's election as Kansas Attorney General, Kline became the district attorney of Johnson County on the day he left office as attorney general, essentially switching jobs with Morrison. Kline then ran for a full term as district attorney, but was defeated by Howe in the August 5, 2008, Republican primary. On October 18, 2013, Kline's Kansas law license was indefinitely suspended by the Kansas Supreme Court, which held in a written opinion that there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Kline committed 11 violations of conduct rules while he was the state's top law enforcement officer from January 2003 to January 2007 and later as Johnson County's District Attorney. While in office, Kline served as Chairman of the Republican Attorneys' General Association, Co-Chairman of the National Violent Sexual Predator Apprehension Task Force, President of the Midwest Association of Attorneys General, Prosecutor of the Year for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill and Executive Committee Member of the National Association of Attorneys General. Kline was a polarizing figure in state politics, largely surrounding the issue of abortion. He filed charges against Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider, and led a years-long effort to prosecute Planned Parenthood in Kansas, which he said had failed to submit reports when young women (15 and younger) came to get abortions."

As of 2011, Maluf is on a second consecutive term as Federal Deputy. His political base is founded on populism and the provision of major public works. His career has been plagued with substantial allegations of corruption, although he was never convicted by the Brazilian courts. He is the president of the local branch, in the state of São Paulo, of the right-wing Progressive Party of Brazil (PP), heir to the old National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA). Interpol has issued a Red Notice to arrest Maluf, extradite him and try him in the United States on charges of conspiracy and criminal possession."

As president of the Privy Council, he became Regent of Thailand following the death of King Bhumibol on October 13, 2016. During the Thai political crisis of the mid-2000s, he was accused by deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his supporters of being a mastermind of the 2006 coup, as well as in the appointment of the post-coup legislature and Interim Government of Surayud Chulanont. The military junta that ousted Thaksin denied that Prem had any important political role. Prem, as the Chief of the Privy Council, was a leader in promoting King Bhumibol's ideologies and royal projects though he sometimes represented himself as being the voice of the king. He urged Thai society to follow the king's advice and himself founded several welfare projects related to education, drug suppression, poverty, and national unity. A southerner, Prem has also dealt personally with trying to resolve the South Thailand insurgency."

He is the only person to hold to every elected seat in the state government under the 1816 constitution. His brief term as governor was marked by the calling of a state constitutional convention and overshadowed by the national anti-slavery debate, where Dunning urged state leaders to issue and forward resolutions to Congress expressing opposition to the expansion of slavery. As a delegate to the subsequent convention, he successfully advocated legislative and educational reform. As the American Civil War broke out, he left the Democratic party and declared for the Union, personally raising many companies of soldiers for the war effort. He returned to the state senate during the war, and then resumed his law practice after his term ended. He remained popular in the state, and declined several nominations to run for office after retiring from politics."

  "text" : "Paul Egerton Piesse is a former co-leader of the Alliance, a New Zealand political party, and union activist. Piesse has been heavily involved in the union movement, and has held a number of senior organisational roles. He was originally a supporter of the Labour Party, and in 1969 stood for Labour in the Rangiora electorate, coming second. He joined NewLabour in protest at the economic policies Labour pursued (\"Rogernomics\") in the late 1980s. NewLabour eventually helped form the Alliance, and Piesse became involved in the new party. In the 1999 election, he stood as the Alliance candidate in the Christchurch East electorate, winning 6.7% of the vote. He was ranked 58th on the Alliance list. Following the splintering of the Alliance, Piesse sided with the Harré-McCarten faction. In the 2002 election, he stood again as an Alliance candidate, gaining 0.5% of the vote in Waimakariri. He was not on the party list. After Harré and McCarten also left the Alliance, Piesse was elected co-leader, alongside Jill Ovens. In the 2005 election he also stood for the Alliance. Piesse was elected President of the Alliance Party at the 2007 national conference held in Dunedin. In the 2008 election he contested the Christchurch East electorate and was number 4 on the Alliance Party list. He fared poorly, coming eighth with only 119 votes. The Alliance also did badly, winning only 0.08% of the party vote nationwide. In the 2011 election he also stood for the Alliance. As of 2015 Piesse has been a sitting member of the Executive Committee of Converge, a left-wing online community network  as well as being an active participant in Hobgoblin, a similar enterprise. At this time his current activities with the Alliance Party are unknown, the most recent statements of his role as president being in 2011."

  "text" : "Pete Sorenson is a County Commissioner in Lane County, Oregon. Born in Washoe County, Nevada, Sorenson is a lawyer and a progressive member of the Democratic Party. From 1977 to 1979, Sorenson served as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture during the Carter Administration. While in private law practice from 1982 to 1995, Sorenson also served as a member of the Board of Education at Lane Community College in Eugene Oregon. During his tenure at Lane Community College, Sorenson advocated strongly for dislocated workers' retraining programs and for childcare for staff and students. In 1993, Sorenson was appointed to the Oregon State Senate, and was elected to a full Senate term in 1994. He was elected Assistant Minority Leader during the 1995 session. Because Oregon term limits at that time prevented Sorenson from running for reelection as a State Senator, he ran for County Commissioner in 1996 and was elected to his first term. He ran successfully for reelection as a County Commissioner in 2000, 2004 and 2008; in 2008 he ran unopposed. In 2009 he was elected by the four other commissioners as Chair of the Board of Commissioners, a position he has held before. Sorenson has always run on a \"pro-environment, pro-education, pro-senior, pro-regular taxpayer, pro-child, pro-civil rights, pro-civil liberties, and pro-people\" platform. In January 2005, Sorenson announced he would challenge incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski, also a Democrat. Sorenson was defeated in the May 2006 Democratic primary for Governor, receiving 16.27% of the vote. In July 2007 Pete Sorenson and Kim Leval were married. Kim is the Executive Director for the Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides. Sorenson has two grown children: Jennifer, a child welfare worker for the state of Oregon, and Erik, an accountant for Sansome Street Advisors in San Francisco California."

He was voted into council for Ottawa City Council in the Rideau-Rockcliffe Ward at the 2010 municipal election. In January 2011 he expressed in local media he believes safety for pedestrians and cyclists is a priority in the city. He supports the bridge to be built over the Rideau river (in his ward), and said this will create a connection to the Laurier Bike Lane to be built if the draft budget is approved. Earlier he indicated Ottawa has to become a city with 21st-century transportation. He also supported the green bin introduction, despite his reputation for fiscal conservatism."

  "text" : "Paula Catherine Wriedt (born 11 December 1968, Hobart) is a former Australian politician. She was an Australian Labor Party member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, representing the outer suburban Hobart seat of Franklin. She was first elected to parliament in the 1996 election. Wriedt is the daughter of former state Labor leader and Whitlam Government Minister for Agriculture Ken Wriedt. Wriedt was appointed Minister for Education in 1998, becoming the youngest ever female member of Cabinet in Tasmania. As Education Minister, in December 2000, she launched \"Learning Together\", a major policy on education, training and information provision for the state of Tasmania. Learning Together promised a complete overhaul of the state's education system, introducing the Essential Learnings Curriculum as a trial way to assess and teach students. Wriedt also funded the establishment of a number of child care centres co-located with government primary schools, and saw the raising of Tasmania's school leaving age from 16 to 17 years. In 2002 she also became Minister for Women. In 2005, Wriedt initiated the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women to recognise the significant contribution that women have made to Tasmania throughout history. In the 2006 Tasmanian state election Wriedt suffered a decline in her primary vote, almost losing her seat to Liberal challenger Vanessa Goodwin, after criticism of the government over the Essential Learnings Curriculum. After the election, she became Minister for Tourism, Arts and the Environment, while David Bartlett assumed her Education portfolio. Following a cabinet reshuffle in January 2008, Wriedt was appointed Minister for Economic Development and Tourism."

He was a popular politician, in part due to his opposition to tax plans proposed by Cardinal Mazarin and his support for other legal reforms. Mazarin arrested him and a number of other members of the Paris Parlement for their politics on 26 August 1648. In response, the people of Paris rebelled and Mazarin was forced to free Broussel two days later. This insurrection touched off the first Fronde. Broussel was appointed Provost of the merchants of Paris (effectively, the mayor) in July 1652, but he resigned in September in order to make it easier to end the civil war he had helped to start."

In 2015, Sharpe resigned from the Legislative Council to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of Newtown at the 2015 election. Newtown was a new seat partially replacing Tebbutt's abolished seat of Marrickville, which had been left open by Tebbutt's retirement. She was defeated in Newtown by Greens candidate Jenny Leong, and was subsequently re-appointed to the Legislative Council to fill her own vacancy. Sharpe, a mother of three, was the first open lesbian to serve in the New South Wales parliament."

  "text" : "Per Carl Gustav Unckel (24 February 1948 – 20 September 2011) was a Swedish Moderate Party politician who served as Minister for Education from 1991 to 1994 and as Governor of Stockholm County from 2007 until his death in 2011. He was born in Östergötland and was at one time chairman of the Moderate Youth League district there. He studied law in Uppsala 1968–71. In 1971, he was elected national chairman of the Moderate Youth League and served until 1976, when he was elected to the Riksdag for Östergötland. In 1986, he became secretary general of the Moderate Party. He stayed in the post until 1991, when the Moderate Party won the election and Carl Bildt became Prime Minister of Sweden. Unckel was then appointed Minister of Education. In that position, he spearheaded the educational reforms that revolutionised the Swedish education system. Among other things, students were allowed to choose among the local schools. After the loss in the election in 1994, Unckel became the party spokesman on labour policy. In 1998 he became chairman of the Committee on the Constitution and one year later he was appointed leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group. The election in 2002 was disastrous for the Moderate Party and several senior figures had to resign from the board of the party. Per Unckel was one of them. He was seen as a part of the old regime - the so-called \"Bunker\" around Carl Bildt, together with the likes of Anders Björk and Gunnar Hökmark. His old Moderate Youth League district, however, paid their respects by electing him honorary chairman. In 2003, he was appointed secretary-general of the Nordic Council of Ministers and retired from Swedish politics. He served until December 2006. He later served as the Chairman of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University. Unckel died on 20 September 2011 from cancer, aged 63."

The youth-oriented party (whose members were commonly called \"Yippies\") was an anti-establishment and countercultural revolutionary group whose views were inspired by the free speech and anti-war movements of the 1960s, mainly the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Yippies were known for using dramatic theatrics in their demonstrations, and they used Pigasus as a way to mock the social status quo. At a rally announcing his candidacy, Pigasus was seized by Chicago policemen and several of his Yippie backers were arrested for disorderly conduct."

  "text" : "Peter Dumont Vroom (December 12, 1791 – November 18, 1873), an American Democratic Party politician, served as the ninth Governor of New Jersey (serving two terms in office; from 1829–1832 and 1833–1836) and as a member of the United States House of Representatives for a single term, from 1839–1841. He was born in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey the son of Col. Peter Dumont Vroom (1745-1831) who represented Somerset County as an Assemblyman (1790–91, 1794–96, and 1811–13) and in the Legislative Council from 1798 to 1804 as a Federalist. The younger Vroom graduated from Columbia College, New York in 1808. After studying law at Somerville Academy he was admitted to the bar in 1813. Vroom was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1826 to 1829. He then served as governor of New Jersey from 1829 to 1832 and 1833 to 1836. As governor, Vroom supported the establishment of the Camden and Amboy Railroad and the Delaware and Raritan Canal. In 1838, Vroom was one of five Democratic candidates for Congress to become involved in the Broad Seal War controversy. Disputed election results caused the U.S. House of Representatives to challenge the Whig candidates certified by Governor William Pennington. After a lengthy fight, Vroom and the four other Democrats were seated in place of the Whigs. Vroom lost his bid for reelection in 1840. He then served as a delegate to the New Jersey State Constitutional Convention in 1844. He was appointed by President Franklin Pierce as United States Minister to Prussia from November 4, 1853 through August 10, 1857. He died in Trenton, New Jersey and was buried in the DuMont Cemetery off River Road in Hillsborough, New Jersey."

As President of the Chamber of Deputies he witnessed the coup d'état that installed the fascist-like dictatorship of the Estado Novo in Brazil. Aleixo was the last Vice President to hold the office of President of the Senate. He was removed from the Vice Presidency on 6 October 1969 by the Brazilian Military Junta of 1969 that at the time was acting in the Presidency due to Costa e Silva's disease. In 2011, pursuant to Law Nº 12.486, dated 12 September, the name of the citizen Pedro Aleixo was included in the gallery of those who were anointed by the Brazilian Nation to the Supreme Magistracy.

  "text" : "Philip Theodore Sica (born September 27, 1934) is the President of Wise Choice Realty who, in 2005, made an unsuccessful bid for Queens borough president in New York City. He was the nominee for the Republican and Conservative parties ultimately losing to incumbent Borough President Helen Marshall. Sica's earliest education was at St. Stephen's Elementary School. Sica graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Pace University (Government and Business), a B.A. from Atlantic Union College (Religion), attended New York Law School, and did religious graduate work with Andrews University. Sica served New York City in various capacities. He worked in the New York City Department of Hospitals, which is now called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain."

  "text" : "Paul Ainslie (born February 4, 1967) is a city councillor in Toronto, Canada. In 2006, he was appointed as an interim councillor in ward 41, and was then elected as the councillor for Ward 43 in Scarborough East. On February 1, 2006, City Council appointed Ainslie to fill the vacancy in Ward 41 that was created when Bas Balkissoon was elected in a provincial by-election in the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River. A condition of the appointment was that he would not run as a candidate in the 2006 election. However, when councillor David Soknacki announced his intention not to run in Ward 43, Ainslie put his name forward as a candidate to replace him. Ainslie used to be an executive assistant to Soknacki. Soknacki supported Ainslie's candidacy. During the election campaign in 2006, a video surfaced which showed Ainslie promising to Toronto City Council not to run. \"I will not run in Ward 41, or any other ward in the city.\" His campaign literature urged voters to \"return\" him to city hall. He said that his campaign team suggested using the word \"re-elect\". Ainslie said, \"I didn't think it was proper.\" Despite the controversy, he elected in Ward 43. In April 2007, he determined that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He moved a motion in committee to remove the expense, but it failed to pass. During the Rob Ford drug allegation scandal, Ainslie was removed as chair from the city's government management committee and appointed as chair of the parks and environment committee. On October 11, 2013 he resigned from the mayor's executive committee and his role as chair of the parks and environment committee over differences with Ford's longterm strategic direction for the city. On May 3, 2013, Ainslie was stopped by a RIDE check on Kingston Road and was given a three-day licence suspension."

  "text" : "Peter John Batchelor (born 21 September 1950) was an Australian politician before retiring at the Victorian State Election on 27 November 2010. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 1990, representing the electorate of Thomastown. He served most recently as Minister for Energy and Resources and Minister for Community Development. He was Minister for Transport from 1999 to 2006. Prior to entering politics he was the state secretary of the Australian Labor Party from 1983 to 1990. Before that he worked for a time at the Furnishing Trades Union. While state secretary of the Labor Party, Batchelor was involved in a scandal surrounding the 1985 Nunawading by-election. He was accused of distributing misleading how-to-vote cards which claimed to be a vote for \"nuclear disarmament\", leading voters to conclude they were voting for the Nuclear Disarmament Party.  Unilateral nuclear disarmament was a popular cause within the Left during the 1980s. Police investigated the matter and Batchelor was not charged with any criminal offence. The biggest project undertaken in transport while Batchelor was minister was the $750 million Regional Fast Rail project. In 2000 the State Government approved funding to upgrade rail lines to provide fast rail passenger services between Melbourne and Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Traralgon. The Victorian Auditor General noted that in spite of money spent, the \"average journey time savings for all passengers using these services are likely to be more modest than implied by the government’s target journey times\". On 7 October 2010, Batchelor announced that he would not re-contest his seat at the 2010 state election and he retired at that election. In February, 2012, Peter Batchelor was appointed President of the Community Broadcasting Foundation. The Foundation, based in Melbourne, is the independent funding body for Australian community radio and television, distributing more than $15m of federal grant monies annually."

Dzhaparidze, an ethnic Georgian joined to Bolsheviks in 1898 where he earned the nickname Alyosha (Alesha), then moved to Baku. Helping the founding of the Azerbaijani socialist party Hummet, he became Delegate of the Caucasian Union of the RSDLP at the 3rd Congress of the RSDLP in London. During his political life, he was many times arrested or exiled for his anti-tsarist activities in Russian Empire. After the February Revolution he became a member of the Caucasian Regional Committee, joined the Baku Commune and became one of the legendary 26 Baku Commissars. He took several different positions in the commune. Dzhaparidze, along with Stepan Shahumyan, Meshadi Azizbekov, Ivan Fioletov and other commissars tried to spread the communist ideology through the whole Caucasus. Soon after the fall of the commune, on the night of September 20, he was executed by firing squad in a remote location between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma on the Trans-Caspian railway along with other Commissars. Dzhaparidze was one of the main four commissars who gained a notable status in Soviet Union as a fallen hero of Russian Revolution. A street in Sochi (Russia) is still named after him and he has a small bust in Moscow. His monument in Baku, capital of the Republic of Azerbaijan was demolished in 2009."

  "text" : "Peter William Jenkins (born April 30, 1944) is a Canadian politician, who has served as deputy premier and health minister in the territorial government of the Yukon, and as mayor of Dawson City. Jenkins, a hotelier, first ran for the territorial legislature in 1989 but lost to NDP cabinet minister Art Webster. In that vote, Jenkins' campaign manager was future Liberal Premier Pat Duncan. Prior to entering provincial politics, he served as mayor of Dawson City from 1980 to 1994, earning the nickname \"Pirate Pete\" after he registered for satellite television service under the name of a dead local pioneer and then redistributed the television signals to residents of Dawson City for free. Jenkins was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 election in Klondike for the Yukon Party. He defended his seat in the 2000 election, the only Yukon Party member to do so. He assumed the leadership of the party after the election. He held the position as sole MLA and leader until May and June 2002, when Dennis Fentie crossed the floor from the NDP and won the leadership party's leadership, defeating Jenkins and former party president Darcy Tkachuk on the first ballot. He defended his seat successfully in the 2002 general election and was sworn into cabinet in November, serving as Health Minister and Deputy Premier until November 28, 2005 when he resigned from the party and cabinet. Jenkins said this was because \"the heart and soul of my community has been ripped out by the inefficiences of government at the municipal level, the territorial level.\" Fentie told the press at the time it was due to the ongoing loans file, which involved Jenkins owing $300,000 to the territorial government he was a part of. This eventually was cleared off the books in March 2006. Jenkins sat as an Independent MLA in the Assembly until dissolution, and chose not to run in the 2006 general election. Jenkins later ran for another term as mayor of Dawson City in the 2009 municipal election, defeating incumbent John Steins by seven votes. He was defeated in the 2012 municipal election by Wayne Potoroka."

Koperberg is a former Australian politician, was the New South Wales Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Water between 2007 and 2008; and was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the electorate of the Blue Mountains for the Australian Labor Party between 2007–2011. Prior to his political career, Koperberg was the Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) in Australia between 1997–2007. \"An expert in risk and crisis management, Phil Koperberg was the overall emergency controller during the 2001 Christmas/New Year fires, when Australia faced its longest and most intense bush firefighting campaign. In 1994 Phil Koperberg was also the overall emergency controller, as firefighters battled to control over 800 New South Wales fires covering in excess of 800,000 hectares. In 1999, his expertise was again called upon during the severe hail storms which damaged more than 30,000 properties.\" In September 1997, Koperberg was appointed the RFS Commissioner when the Service was formed under the Rural Fires Act. Before this he had been Director-General of the New South Wales Bush Fire Service from May 1990. In March 2007 he was elected to State parliament and appointed to the Ministry. However, in December he was forced to stand aside due to a police investigation regarding domestic violence allegations from 1987. The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press charges and Koperberg was reinstated to the Ministry. He resigned from the Ministry on 22 February 2008. Koperberg did not recontest the 2011 state election."

The terrorists demanded a release of several imprisoned group members, including Horst Mahler, one of the founders of the Red Army Faction (RAF) and future RAF militants Verena Becker and Rolf Heissler.Although Mahler refused to be exchanged, the other prisoners were set free. After the militants had been flown out to Aden, South Yemen, Lorenz was set free on 4 March. He had won the plurality (43.9%) of votes while being absent, nevertheless Klaus Schütz, relying on a coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats, remained mayor. One of the freed prisoners, Rolf Heissler, became a member of the group which abducted Hanns-Martin Schleyer in 1977 to exchange him for imprisoned RAF members. After the operation had failed, Schleyer was killed. Heissler was one of his two murderers."

  "text" : "Phil Keisling (born June 23, 1955) is a politician and business executive in the U.S. state of Oregon. He served as Oregon Secretary of State from 1991 to 1999 and previously served in the Oregon House of Representatives. He is known for having championed the state's vote-by-mail system. Currently, Keisling is the Director of the Center for Public Service, located in the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University. Keisling oversees more than a dozen separate programs serving local, state, federal government, and international organizations in the U.S. and several countries (including Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, and China). Keisling graduated from Sunset High School in 1973 and Yale University in 1977. Prior to seeking public office, Keisling pursued a career in journalism, including six years as a reporter and correspondent in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, and two years as editor of Washington Monthly. He is a Democrat, and a member of the Democratic Leadership Council. From 2000 to 2009, Keisling was a Senior Vice President for Marketing for the Oregon high tech company, CorSource Technology Group, Inc. (formerly Hepieric, Inc.), has remained deeply involved in politics and civic affairs since leaving office, serving on a variety of local, statewide and national committees, commissions and organizations, both inside and outside of government. In 2010, Keisling joined a new statewide Trade association, Smart Grid Oregon, as its Board Chairman. The organization has been created to enable, promote and grow the smart grid industry and infrastructure in the State of Oregon. He accepted appointment in 1998 to the Performance Audit Implementation Steering Committee of the Portland Public Schools, which guided the financially troubled district through comprehensive reform in response to an independent performance audit. When a proposal came before the Oregon State Legislature in 2003 transfer responsibility for audits of state agencies and programs from the Audit Division of the Secretary of State to the Legislature, Keisling joined with four other former Secretaries of States of both parties, Mark Hatfield, Clay Myers, Norma Paulus, and Barbara Roberts, to publicly denounce the move. Keisling is a chief proponent of open primaries in Oregon, contributing to and later promoting a 2004 white paper sponsored by the non-partisan Oregon Progress Forum. The Public Commission on the Oregon Legislature included open primaries among its sweeping proposals for reforms to the legislature. Keisling and Paulus, a Republican, headed an initiative petition signature drive to place the issue on the 2006 ballot. Of the 91,401 petition signatures submitted, only 67% were determined to be valid, and the measure did not make it to a vote. They tried again in 2008, successfully placing Measure 65 on the ballot. A longtime supporter of open government, Keisling serves on the Board of Open Oregon, a statewide advocacy and watchdog organization involved in Oregon Public Meeting Law (Sunshine Law) enforcement, and other government secrecy issues. He is also a co-founder and board member of the Oregon Public Affairs Network (OPAN), roughly based on the C-SPAN television model."

He stood again in Reigate at the 1931 general election, when there was no Liberal candidate, and he came second with only 17.3% of the vote, a Conservative majority of over 65%. He did not contest the 1935 general election. In the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Merseyside constituency of Birkenhead West, overturning the previous Conservative majority of 3,753 with a swing of 13.2%. His constituency was abolished in boundary changes for the 1950 general election, and he was returned for the new Birkenhead constituency. He held the seat until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1964 general election. In Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1945 to 1947."

As RBI Governor he strongly opposed the nationalising of private banks in India, by writing a letter to then Deputy Prime Minister Morarji Desai warning about the costs of nationalising the banks saying it was not desirable. During his tenure the size of the currency notes oF denomination 5, 10 and 100 were reduced in size for economic reasons. Bhattacharya's tenure saw the establishment of the Industrial Development Bank of India in 1964, the Agricultural Refinance Corporation in 1963 and the Unit Trust of India in 1964. B Chandrakala"

He was a foundation member of the newly created Socialist Party of Australia (SPA) formed in December that year, and was elected General Secretary at its first Congress. In the Second World War, Symon served in the army, then the air force, and in later life worked as a waterside labourer in Adelaide. The SPA changed its name to the Communist Party of Australia at its 1996 Congress. Symon's position as General Secretary was reconfirmed after the Party's 10th Congress in 2005."

In 2009, she was openly critical of the Left Front rule of the state of Bengal, saying that crimes against women have been growing in the previous 33 years of rule. In 2014, she was part of a group of women who supported an Aam Sabha for the 33% Women's Reservation Bill. She stated that the bill would help \"empower Indian women socially, economically and politically.\" Thakur has spoken out on other women's issues, calling for stricter anti-rape provisions in India. Thakur was also a supporter of laws against 'honour killings.' She has responded to comments about implementing dress codes to combat incidents of rape and has been quoted saying, \"The question is not about the dress code, but the mentality of men. What the girls should wear should be the concern of the girl, her parents and her family only. I don't think there is a need for anyone else to say anything about how a girl should behave.\" Thakur believes instead, that as more women see rapists being dealt \"justice,\" they will be more likely to file cases against assailants. She has previously spoken out about the amount of violent crime against women in Delhi."

Pierre Bernard is the founder of the far-right NGO France Debout, over which he presided until 2004. He recently joined the Centre Charlier, headed by the former National Front MEP Bernard Antony and president of AGRIF. In 1988, Pierre Bernard prohibited the registering of the children of immigrants to kindergarten and to school meals, leading twice to condemnation for racial discrimination in 1988 and 1991. He took as lawyer Jacques Trémollet de Villers, president of the La Cité Catholique fundamentalist group. He was again condemned for hate speech in 2002, by virtue of the Gayssot Act, and relaxed in September 2005 for another racial discrimination charge. He was also scolded by the CNIL on charges of racial profiling. Bernard assisted in 1996 at the funerals of the war criminal and Collaborationist Paul Touvier. He also regularly collaborates with Tribune nationaliste, the mouthpiece of the Neo-Nazi group Parti nationaliste français et européen (PNFE). He was given the rank of knight of the Légion d'honneur in the beginning of 2006 on proposal of the current French President Nicolas Sarkozy."

He evolved from a local sewage contractor to a political boss by carefully selecting his political allies. His prominence stems from the death of Anton Cermak and his political career is intertwined with that of Edward Joseph Kelly. The success of this machine was attributed to its decision to be more inclusive than its predecessors. This meant that Nash had success at dealing with a variety of politicians such as William L. Dawson."

Born in Carrigallen, County Leitrim, Galligan attended school at St. Patrick's in Cavan. As a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish Volunteers, during the Easter Rising Galligan cycled from Dublin to Wexford carrying James Connolly's battle orders to ensure that the volunteers in the area rose to support those in Dublin. When the volunteers disbanded he cycled back to Cavan but was arrested at the family home. He was elected unopposed as the Sinn Féin MP for Cavan West at the 1918 general election. The following month, in January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann, though Galligan did not attend as he was in prison. He was arrested again in September 1920  and re-elected as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cavan constituency at the 1921 elections. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He did not contest the 1922 general election and retired from politics."

  "text" : "Pierre Jean Louis Ovide Doublet (25 August 1749 - 4 February 1824) was a French politician and writer who spent much of his life serving in the Knights of Malta. Following his enlistment as a soldier, he entered the service of the French Secretariat of the Knights and was eventually promoted to the leadership of the Secretariat. Doublet participated in the negotiations for the surrender of the Knights when Malta was captured by Napoleon in 1798. Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim had failed to bolster Valletta's defenses against the French fleet and had peacefully admitted some French ships to the harbor, leading to the island's capture. Doublet, being in the Grand Master's direct service, was accused as a collaborator with the French and became caught in the political maneuvering by other members to depose Hompesch. Doublet stayed in Malta during the French occupation, serving as Secretary General to the Commission of Government installed by Napoleon and later becoming Commissioner of Malta. He was exiled to France when the island became a British Dominion in 1800 and wrote a book about his experiences in Malta. Doublet remained in exile for most of his life, though he was allowed to make a permanent return soon before his death."

He left Labour to join the Communist Party of Ireland in protest over the Constitution of the Irish Free State's requiring the Oath of Allegiance for all legislators. He participated in the Third Dáil when it met as a \"Provisional Parliament and Constitutent Assembly\" in September 1922, but withdrew when it became the Free State Dáil in December as the Constitution came into force and the Oath was required. He stood as a \"Republican Labour\" candidate in the 1923 general election but was defeated."

  "text" : "Paul T. Jordan (born c. 1941) is an American physician and Democratic Party politician who served as the 37th Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. He succeeded interim mayor Charles K. Krieger. Being 30 years old at the time of his election, Jordan is the youngest mayor in the history of Jersey City. After graduating from medical school in 1968, Jordan ran a drug rehabilitation center in Jersey City. His political involvement began when he joined a local reform group called the Community Action Council. Jordan was first elected as a reform candidate in a special election following the resignation of Thomas J. Whelan after Whelan's conviction for extortion and conspiracy. Jordan's election was hailed as an end to machine control of Jersey City politics, and was credited to support from a large number of young voters. He was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1973. Jordan was the first mayor to propose a major redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront. During his term, Jordan appointed Shirley Tolentino as the first African-American woman to serve as a full-time municipal court judge in New Jersey. In 1977, Jordan simultaneously ran for reelection in Jersey City's non-partisan May election and for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey, with the primary held in June. Jordan used an aggressive television advertising campaign that was estimated to cost up to $200,000. After losing the mayoral election, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and supported incumbent Governor Brendan Byrne. Jordan's campaign later received a $30,000 campaign contribution from Byrne's campaign, allowing him to retire 25% of his campaign debt. Jordan retired from politics and returned to his medical career following his withdrawal from the primary. He later served as the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at Trinitas Hospital in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Jordan currently serves as a member of the New Jersey State Board of Human Services and served as its chairman from 1991 until 1996. He is also the treasurer of the State Board of Medical Examiners."

He was a delegate to the French Senate from 1949 to 1958, and founded the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG). In 1954, Léon M'ba joined the party and eventually overthrew Gondjout as leader. In 1960, then President M'ba reshuffled the government without consulting Parliament. When Gondjout filed a motion of censure he was charged with attempting a coup d'état and sentenced to two years in prison. Following his release, M'ba appointed him to the largely symbolic post of President of the Economic Council, in part to silence the threat he represented. Gondjout served as Minister of State during the abortive 1964 Gabon coup d'état but was acquitted of all charges during his subsequent trial. He lived outside public view from his 1966 acquittal to his death on 1 July 1990 and there is little record of his life during this period."

  "text" : "Peter Wilson Raffan (1863 – June 23, 1940) was a British Liberal politician. Raffan came from Newbridge, Monmouthshire, and in 1910 was chairman of the Monmouthshire County Council. When a general election was called in January 1910, P W Raffan was selected as Liberal candidate for Leigh in south Lancashire. John Brunner, the sitting Liberal member of parliament, had chosen to stand in Northwich. The constituency contained a large number of coalminers, and Raffan was opposed not only by the Conservatives, but by Thomas Greenall of the Labour Party, who was a leader of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. Leigh was one of the few seats where Labour and Liberals ran against each other. Raffan won the seat easily. In the Commons Raffan became secretary of the Land Values Group who sought reform in property taxation. He supported women's suffrage, disestablishment of the Church in Wales and the temperance movement. At the 1918 general election Raffan was re-elected at Leigh as a Liberal and received the \"coupon\" despite being an opponent of the Coalition Government. At the 1922 election he stood unsuccessfully for election as a Liberal at Ayr Burghs. At the succeeding 1923 general election he successfully contested Edinburgh North for the Liberals, unseating the Unionist MP, Patrick Johnstone Ford. He only held the seat for one year, with Ford regaining the seat in the 1924 general election."

He is the only person in the state's history to serve as both Chief Judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals and Chief Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. Popovich was born in Crosby, Minnesota in 1920. He earned degrees from the University of Minnesota and William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law) in 1942 and 1947, respectively. He was in private practice in the Twin Cities from 1947 to 1983, while also serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1953 to 1963. Upon the creation of the state Court of Appeals in 1983, Governor Rudy Perpich appointed Popovich to be Chief Judge. Perpich elevated him to the Supreme Court in 1987, and named him Chief Justice in 1989. Popovich resigned as Chief Justice in late 1990, having reached mandatory retirement age. Following his retirement from the Supreme Court, Popovich joined the Minneapolis law firm of Briggs & Morgan. He died in early 1996 at the age of 75."

  "text" : "Patrick Ryan (Lacken) (16 November 1898 – 21 January 1944) was an Irish nationalist and politician. He was born in Newport, County Tipperary. Pat Ryan became active in the Irish War of Independence in Limerick and Tipperary, serving as Captain in the C Company of the 6th Battalion, Tipperary No. 1 Brigade, 3rd South Division of the IRA. He took the Anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War, and was arrested by Pro-Treaty forces in 1923. In his Civil War memoir The Gates Flew Open, Peadar O'Donnell describes an incident where Ryan, under sentence of execution, was mistakenly transferred to Harepark Camp in the Curragh. When the order came to hand him over, he was kept hidden by his fellow prisoners. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary constituency at the 1923 general election. He did not take his seat in the Dáil due to Sinn Féin's abstentionist policy. He did not contest the June 1927 general election. He emigrated to the US where be became a businessman, still supporting Irish nationalist campaigns, he died in America on 21 January 1944. His family were heavily involved in Irish nationalism and the GAA, his father was a local GAA official. His uncle was the priest and GAA figure Canon Michael Kennedy Ryan, and his brother Martin Ryan served as a Fianna Fáil TD for Tipperary from 1933 to 1943. Newport GAA's Lacken Park is named after him."

  "text" : "Philip Roy (Phil) Gray (born 20 April 1947) is an Australian politician. He was a Labor member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 2006 to 2009. Born in Brisbane, Gray attended state schools before becoming a teacher, studying at the University of Queensland and the University of New England. A member of the Australian Labor Party, he was elected as the member for Gaven in the 2006 state election, defeating National Party member Alex Douglas, who had won the seat against Gray in a by-election earlier that year. In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin."

  "text" : "Pierpont Edwards (April 8, 1750 – April 5, 1826) was a delegate to the American Continental Congress, and later a United States federal judge. He has been described as \"a brilliant but erratic member of the Connecticut bar, tolerant in religious matters and bitterly hated by stern Calvinists, a man whose personal morality resembled greatly that of Aaron Burr\". Pierpont Edwards was the founder of the Toleration Party in Connecticut. He was born in Northampton, Massachusetts as the 11th and youngest child of the Rev. Jonathan Edwards. Pierpont Edwards graduated from Princeton College in 1768, at the age of 18, and entered private practice of law in New Haven, Connecticut in 1771. He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and thereafter was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1777, a Delegate from Connecticut to the Continental Congress from 1787 to 1788, and a member of the Connecticut Convention held in January 1788, a convention that ratified the Constitution of the United States. After the treason of Benedict Arnold, he became administrator of that officer's estate. Edwards was again in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1784 to 1785 and from 1787 to 1790. He was in private practice of law in New Haven, Connecticut from 1790 to 1806, also serving in that time as the United States Attorney for Connecticut. On February 21, 1806, Edwards was nominated by President Thomas Jefferson to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut vacated by Richard Law. Edwards was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 24, 1806, and received his commission the same day, serving thereafter for twenty years, until his death. He died in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and was interred at Grove Street Cemetery. Pierpont Township, Ashtabula County, Ohio is named for him. There is a dormitory building at UMass Amherst named after him as well. He was the uncle of Aaron Burr, Theodore Dwight, and Timothy Dwight IV, and father of Henry W. Edwards and John Stark Edwards. He was also the father-in-law of Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, who married his daughter Henrietta."

  "text" : "Peter O'Brien is an Irish Politician who stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate for election to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council during the 2009 Local Government Elections. He is currently employed as Personal Assistant to Mary Hanafin T.D., Minister for Social & Family Affairs. Prior to his employment with Hanafin he was employed in a number of NGO roles including as a Director of Support Services for the Special Olympics World Summer Games. O'Brien has been appointed by Hanafin to a number of organisations including the National Children’s Advisory Council, Dún Laoghaire Local Drugs Task Force and the Dún Laoghaire Young People’s Facilities and Services Fund. In November 2008, O'Brien was selected alongside sitting Fianna Fáil Councillor Cormac Devlin to seek election in the Dún Laoghaire Local Electoral Area. During the course of the election O’Brien became embroiled in a number of embarrassing controversies. In late April the Mail on Sunday ran a story claiming Hanafin improperly used Oireachtas envelopes, which are provided at taxpayer expense, to promote O’Brien’s campaign launch in a local Dalkey Hotel. On 17 May 2009 O'Brien became very publicly embroiled in a bitter dispute with a local pensioner over the placement of election posters he erected in his local area. Throughout the Local Election Campaign, O'Brien attracted the strong support of Minister Mary Hanafin, with one newspaper commenting Hanafin was trying to \"shaft\" the sitting Fianna Fáil County Councillor Cormac Devlin. On 26 May 2009, O'Brien became embroiled in further controversy when a national newspaper ran a story claiming Hanafin's office went as far as using tax payer funded resources to promote him in correspondence to voters in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. O'Brien secured 647 (3.6%) first preference votes on polling day and failed to get elected."

  "text" : "Pir Mazhar Ul Haq (Urdu:  پیر مظہر الحق ‎) is a politician in Pakistan who comes from the spiritual family of Bhan Syedabad and is a descendant of Makhdoom Moosa, 5th son of Hazrat Makhdoom Sarwar Nooh of Hala. Pir Mazhar who is considered one of the most loyal members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has offered many sacrifices for the party. He has faced jail and exile as a result of the political victimization campaigns run by those governments who were brought in power (directly or indirectly) by the military dictators but he never compromised on principles. He joined the PPP when other activists had started jumping off the PPP ship after the imposition of Gen Zia's martial law in the late 1970s. During the PPP governments in 1988 and 1993, Pir Mazhar was inducted as minister for housing and town planning, and law and parliamentary affairs respectively. He is currently the Parliamentary leader of Pakistan Peoples Party in Sindh Assembly, a member of the Central Executive Committee of Pakistan Peoples Party and the Senior Minister in the Sindh Provincial Government, holding the portfolios of Education, Literacy and Criminal Prosecution Service. Pir Mazhar Ul Haq was first elected to the Sindh Assembly from PS-74 Dadu-IV in Dadu, Sindh, Pakistan in 1988 and has continued winning all the elections he has contested since then from this constituency. This is one of the most politically influential families of Sindh. His paternal grandfather was Pir Ilahi Bux who was nominated the Chief Minister of Sindh province by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Pir Sahib was always proud to have been nominated as the Chief Minister of Sindh by no less than the Quaid-e-Azam himself. He also remained minister for 10 years, holding the portfolio of Education. Pir Mazhar's maternal grandfather was Qazi Akbar who was one of the longest serving provincial minister in Sindh holding several portfolios including the Home department. His aunt (Qazi Akbar's niece) is Fahmida Mirza who served as the Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan. His uncle is Zulfiqar Mirza who is also Fahmida Mirza's husband served as the Home Minister of Sindh. His daughter Marvi Mazhar contested in the 2002 general elections from Dadu constituency and got elected as the first women member of parliament to be elected from Dadu District. His Son in Law is Jam Ikram Dharejo who got elected as a member of parliament (MPA) by defeating the Mahers of Ghotki (also one of the powerful political and tribal families of Sindh). His eldest son Pir Mujeeb is currently serving as member of parliament from the Dadu constituency. He is also the great nephew of Qazi Abdul Majeed Abid, who has held numerous Federal Ministries, including Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, and Federal Minister for Water and Power. Pir Mazhar is an articulate lawyer and if he had not jumped into politics, he would have been among the top lawyers of the country. He is also considered as one of the closest aides to the Late Benazir bhutto and her husband (current President of Pakistan) Asif Ali Zardari. During his more than three decades of association with the PPP, he suffered incarceration in 15 prisons (including the dreaded Machh Jail), Torture, kidnapping, and exile but he steadfastly clung to the party and did not succumb to any pressure put on him to change his loyalties. His eldest son Barrister Pir Mujeeb Ul Haq is an office bearer of the Pakistan Peoples Party in Dadu District and has his own law practice with the name of P.I.B. Law Associates having chambers in Karachi, Hyderabad and Dadu. He is also an elected member of Parliament from the Dadu Constituency. His second son Pir Danish Ali is currently serving Pakistan Peoples Party as its President in Dadu city which has been the ancestral constituency of the Pir family since before the independence of Pakistan."

  "text" : "Percival Hillam Quirke (29 July 1898 – 25 March 1972) was an Australian politician. A farmer and soldier prior to entering politics, Quirke contested the normally safely conservative federal seat of Wakefield in a 1938 by-election as an independent. He finished a distant third on the primary vote, with 22.8 percent behind former Liberal and Country League Premier Richard Layton Butler and Labor challenger Sydney McHugh. However, on the second count, almost 83 percent of his preferences flowed to McHugh, enough for McHugh to decisively defeat Butler with 56 percent of the two-party vote. Quirke later won the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Stanley, serving from 1941 as a Labor member, before leaving Labor in 1948, representing the seat of Burra as an independent until 1963, then the LCL until he resigned from politics in 1968. Quirke and the other independent in the legislature, Tom Stott held the balance of power at the 1962 election. They both provided confidence and supply to the Playford Liberal and Country League (LCL) as a minority government in the hung parliament, allowing Playford to remain in power for what would be his final term. Stott became Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly following the election. In 1963 Quirke ceased being an independent, joined the LCL, and served in the Playford LCL ministry in the portfolios of Irrigation, Lands, and Repatriation until the LCL lost government at the 1965 election."

He was an active member of the Nova Scotia Teachers Union, serving as president of the Halifax Local. He also served as President of the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia. Delefes attempted to enter provincial politics in 1997, but lost to Liberal Ed Kinley by 165 votes in a byelection for the Halifax Citadel riding. He ran again in 1998, and appeared to defeat Kinley by 125 votes on election night, however, there was some confusion over the calculation of poll results and the margin of victory was reduced to 40 when official results were announced. A judicial recount was held on April 14, and Delefes was officially declared elected by 37 votes. In the 1999 election, Delefes and Kinley ran against each other for the third time in 19 months, but Progressive Conservative Jane Purves won the seat, defeating Delefes by 434 votes. Delefes tried to regain the seat in the 2003 election, but both he and Purves were defeated by Liberal leader Danny Graham."

Alfonsi served in the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1933-1939 and 1959–1969 and was speaker of the Assembly in 1937. Alfonsi ran, unsuccessfully, in an attempt to gain the Progressive Party nomination for governor in 1940, but was defeated by Orland Loomis. In 1942 he switched parties and ran, once again, unsuccessfully in the Republican primary against Alvin O'Konski. Following this defeat, he enlisted in the United States Army during World War Two. Upon being discharged, he returned to teaching and became the Principal of Minocqua High School. Alfonsi returned to the state assembly, this time as a Republican, in 1958, and went on to serve as the assembly majority and minority leader. In 1967, Alfonsi was convicted of bribery. However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction. Then Alfonsi was retried, but was acquitted. Alfonsi died in Madison, Wisconsin on November 22, 1989."

  "text" : "The presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began during the turbulent Reconstruction period following the American Civil War. Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was re-elected to the office in 1872, serving from March 4, 1869, to March 4, 1877. Grant was a Republican, and his main supporters were the Radical and Stalwart factions. The United States was at peace with the world throughout the era, and was prosperous until the Panic of 1873, a severe national depression, that dominated Grant's second term. Grant bolstered the Executive Branch's enforcement powers by signing into law the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General that was implemented to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Grant expanded federal authority that protected African American civil rights against domestic terrorism in the South. Grant's presidency represented the Civil War values that included \"union, freedom and equality.\" Grant's Reconstruction policy, however, was challenged by the complexities of using the U.S. Army to impose democracy and legal equality regardless of the resistance of Democrats in the South. Grant worked hard to ensure the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment that gave black men the right to vote. Grant's notable efforts as President included civil rights, civil service reform, and Indian policy. Grant's foreign policy under Hamilton Fish was successful and improved Anglo-American relations. Grant was opposed by the Liberal faction of the Republican Party, many of them founding fathers of the GOP, who denounced Grant for violating the party's emphasis on fighting corruption. The Liberals insisted that Reconstruction had been successful, that slavery and secessionism were dead. Liberals demanded that Army troops should be withdrawn from the South so that normal political life could resume. The Liberals nominated long-time Republican spokesman Horace Greeley in 1872, depriving Grant of the intellectual base of the Republican Party. Greeley was quietly supported by the Democrats, but was decisively defeated by Grant. Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers, Grant was overconfident in choosing his Cabinet; he relied heavily on former Army associates who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics. His presidential reputation was severely damaged by repeated scandals and frauds. Having struggled to be a self-made man, Grant was extremely loyal to himself and his family, while trusting of close military associates that in turn caused dissension among reformers whom he believed were plotting to overthrow his presidency. Grant dismissed three Cabinet members without notice or explanation. Two of his Cabinet secretaries (War and Navy), his personal secretary, and high officials he named to the Treasury department joined federal bribery or tax-evasion syndicates. Corruption charges were rampant in the Department of the Interior in 1874, until Grant appointed a reformer. Grant often defended the culprits, rather than the integrity of government service, while he attacked their accusers. Middle-class public opinion, a key element in the Republican Party base, turned hostile to Grant. Some scholars, however, maintain that corruption charges were exaggerated during the Grant administration, and that Grant implemented civil service reform and ended the moiety system. Grant played a role in thwarting the Gold Ring in 1869 and the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring in 1875. His Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell made sweeping reforms in their respected departments, and several of Grant's Cabinet initiated civil service in their own departments. After a false start with weak selections, Grant named to his Cabinet leading reformers including Hamilton Fish, Benjamin Bristow, Alphonso Taft, and Amos T. Akerman. Fish, as Secretary of State, negotiated the Treaty of Washington and was successful at keeping the United States out of trouble with Britain and Spain. Bristow, as Secretary of Treasury, ended the corruption of the Whiskey Ring where distillers and corrupt officials made millions from tax evasion. Taft, a brilliant jurist as Attorney General, successfully negotiated for bipartisan panel to peacefully settle the controversial Election of 1876. Grant and Attorney General Akerman enforced civil rights legislation that protected African Americans and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan. Grant encouraged peaceful Congressional negotiations after the controversial Election of 1876; signed the Electoral Commission Act of 1877; while the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction. Economically, Grant was a conservative who favored a hard-money, gold-based, anti-inflationary policy that entailed paying off the large national debt with gold. He reduced governmental spending, decreased the federal work force, and reduced the national debt, while tax revenues increased in the Treasury Department. During his second term in office, the Panic of 1873, caused by rampant railroad speculation, shook the nation's financial institutions; banks failed, prices fell, and unemployment surged. Before the Panic there had been eight years of tremendous industrial growth after the Civil War that fueled lavish money making schemes, personal greed, and national corruption. President Grant's contraction of money supply worsened the panic; the ensuing major U.S. depression that followed lasted for five years causing massive economic damage to the country. The Panic wiped out both the fortunes of business and corruption. Southern Reconstruction continued that included escalated sectional violence over the status of freedmen and fractured state party alliances and elections. With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans. Grant implemented an innovative peace policy, though not always successful, with Native Americans. Hostilities took place with the Modoc War, the Red River War, and the Great Sioux War that culminated with the famous Battle of Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed. In 1874, millions of buffalo were being slaughtered to make room for settlers and ranchers. Grant, who favored ranchers land use for domestic cattle, rejected legislation that would have limited the slaughter of the bison. After the fatal Modoc peace commission in 1873, Grant's Native American policy incorporated the military strategies favored by William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan. Grant gave legislative support to the early suffragette movement. Corruption was rampant in the Department of Indian Affairs under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano. However, Grant and Secretary Delano did have success in the establishment of America's first national park, Yellowstone, and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. The Interior Department corruption was cleaned up by Grant's Secretary Zachariah Chandler in 1875. Grant's presidential legacy has suffered due to his heavy-handed use of the U.S. Army to prop up his political allies in southern states. However, since the mid-1990s his presidential reputation has improved as historians emphasize his enforcement of African American civil rights in the South and his Peace policy towards Indians."

  "text" : "Philip Henry (Pat) Morton (28 October 1910 – 18 January 1999) was an Australian businessman and politician. Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999."

He is a member of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) in the governing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. Kamalanathan was elected to Parliament in April 2010 in a by-election after the death of the incumbent member Datuk Zainal Abidin Ahmad. The by-election saw the seat shift from Zainal's opposition People's Justice Party to the Barisan Nasional. The MIC had sought to field veteran politician Datuk G. Palanivel, but Barisan Nasional's leaders wanted a lesser-known candidate. On 16 May 2013, after the 13th general election, Kamalanathan was appointed as Deputy Minister of Education and Higher Learning I under the new cabinet of Prime Minister Najib Razak"

  "text" : "Peter Fenton (May 12, 1886 – October 5, 1953) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario from 1930 to 1932. He was the 17th mayor of Sudbury since its incorporation in 1893, and the first mayor of Sudbury after it was granted city status in 1930. On November 27, 1929 he was acclaimed mayor of the city due to the lack of candidates running for office in the 1929 election. In 1930 he stood again for mayor. During the election campaign he promised to build a new town hall and a subway under the Elm Street rail line, along with improving the local utilities in conjunction with municipal services. His campaign slogan was \"Sudbury is a progressive city; we should be optimists and boasters, not pessimists and knockers\". Fenton was widely regarded as a populist mayor and a worthy political opponent. On December 1, 1930, he won the election with 1,373 votes, the largest win in a municipal election in Sudbury at that time. He was successful at incorporating the city and building the Sudbury Jail, and did the best he could to enable the City of Sudbury to provide relief to citizens affected by the Great Depression. He converted the former jail into a flop house, and was able to provide relief to 4,142 recipients in December 1930. However, in an effort to encourage the recipients to \"find work\", meals were gradually cut back from three meals to one meal per day by March 1931. Despite his attempts at advocating for the impoverished citizens of Sudbury, his spending and confrontational style eventually thrust him out of office amid some controversy. Known for unilaterally making decisions on council and running a deficit, he was defeated in 1932 by W. Marr Brodie. Brodie was successful at demanding stricter practices in administering the city's welfare programs, the issue which cost Fenton the election. The ballots cast were 3,138 to 1,591, a clear margin of victory for Brodie."

Banco Latino was the first bank to fail in the Venezuelan banking crisis of 1994. He was a candidate in the Venezuelan presidential election, 1973, in which he was one of four candidates claiming the backing of Marcos Pérez Jiménez; he won less than 1% of the vote. Pedro Tinoco was also a professor of Public Finance and Political Economy at Universidad Central de Venezuela. Tinoco was the son of the Pedro Tinoco Smith who was Minister of Interior (1931-5) in the government of Juan Vicente Gómez. Tinoco Sr created the law firm Escritorio Tinoco in 1914; Tinoco Jr would later take over the firm and along with his partners make it \"a powerful player in the Venezuelan legal market\"."

Parker moved to Miami, Florida in 1906 where he organized the McCrimmon Lumber Company with his ther-in-law C.T. McCrimmon. In 1912, Parker purchased his brother-in-law's interest in the company, renaming it P.A. Henderson Lumber Company. Parker was elected Mayor of Miami in June, 1915 taking office the following November. He was elected again in 1923.

Galloway graduated with a BA from the University of Chicago in 1976, and earned her MD from the University of Virginia in 1980. Galloway is a member of a number of medical committees, and was the past Chairperson of the Marathon Republican Party. She was elected to the Wisconsin Senate in 2010. She had been facing an effort to recall her from office. However, on March 16, 2012, Galloway announced her resignation from office due to health issues in her family, leaving the Senate evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Galloway's seat was filled in the recall election, which had already been scheduled. She was succeeded by fellow Republican Jerry Petrowski. Galloway relocated to Warsaw, Indiana where she announced in May 2015 that she would make a bid for the United States House of Representatives and run for Marlin Stutzman's seat in Indiana's 3rd congressional district. As of July 2015 she raised $51,423 in campaign contributions, with $50,000 coming from loans she made to herself."

  "text" : "Patrick Michael Callaghan (1927 – January 5, 2009) was a politician in New Brunswick, Canada who was briefly leader of the New Democratic Party of New Brunswick. Callaghan was born in Scotland and raised in Dunbarton and the Red Clydeside area of Scotland which was known for its radicalism. As a youth he joined the Scottish National Party followed by the Labour Party. In 1954, he emigrated to Halifax, Nova Scotia and then moved to New Brunswick where he settled in Fredericton, established a window cleaning business, and joined the province's Co-operative Commonwealth Federation which became the New Democratic Party in 1962. He was a candidate for the federal NDP in 1965 and 1968. In 1970, he was approached by a group of young radical socialists active at the University of New Brunswick and established a riding association in York—Sunbury with himself as president. The group soon became involved with the Ontario-based Waffle movement, a left wing socialist faction within the NDP and helped found the New Brunswick chapter of the Waffle in late 1970. The Waffle became a dominant force in the New Brunswick NDP in 1971 and Callaghan announced his intention to seek the party's leadership. Due to conflicts between Wafflers and anti-Wafflers over the legitimacy of the party's fall convention at which the New Brunswick Waffle manifesto had been approved, the party split into two, on October 16, 1971, with one faction led by Callaghan and a second, non-Waffle faction led by J. Albert Richardson with both men claiming to be NDP leader. The federal NDP intervened on November 12, 1971 by suspending the New Brunswick NDP and calling a special convention for November 21 to resolve the dispute. The Wafflers were demoralized by this and Callaghan spoke of leaving the NDP and reviving the CCF. Callaghan and many other Wafflers did not attend the special convention which saw the re-election of J. Albert Richardson as party leader. The Waffle declined and was inactive by the end of the year."

  "text" : "Peter Dawson (April 11, 1892 – March 24, 1963) was a Canadian minister, politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Dawson was born in 1892 in Scotland. After attending schools and briefly working as a labourer and an apprentice to a butcher in Maybole, Dawson immigrated to Canada at the age of 18 with his brother, James Dawson. Shortly after arriving, he took up residence in Ontario where he worked in the automobile profession for 7 years until moving west to Alberta in 1918. Following his decision to settle in Calgary, he found employment as a butcher and interest in missionary work. His residence in Calgary, however, didn't last long, as 5 years later, he moved to the nearby capital city of Edmonton, where he attended Prebysterian schooling. Ordained as a minister of the United Church in 1927, he soon was called in 1928 to Sedgewick, where he remained for two years, before getting called to Champion. Although not intending to have a career in politics, a group of citizens persuaded him to run in the 1935 election, in which he defeated United Farmers Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. In 1937, Dawson was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. During his 26-year tenure, from 1937 until his death in 1963, he witnessed and presided over many events, such as the first instance of crossing the floor in Alberta and naming a fellow MLA for remarks made at a provincial official. He also witnessed 2 royal visits to Alberta from two different monarchs, King George IV in 1939, and Queen Elizabeth II 20 years later, in which he presided over the installation of a fountain in the Legislature's rotunda. After dying in office in 1963, Dawson was honoured with a state funeral, attended by many prominent citizens of Alberta."

  "text" : "Pelenike Tekinene Isaia served in the Parliament of Tuvalu from 2011 to 2015. Before her election as an MP she worked for the Tuvalu Cooperative Society, as its branch manager in Nui. Her career in national politics began when she won the August 2011 by-election for the constituency of Nui, and thus entered Parliament. The by-election had been caused by the death of her husband, the incumbent MP and Minister for Works Isaia Italeli. Pelenike Isaia stated she would aim to continue his work, and she was the candidate endorsed by Prime Minister Willy Telavi's government. Italeli's death had deprived the Telavi government of its one-seat majority in Parliament, and when Pelenike Isaia won the by-election, defeating the only other candidate (Leneuoti Maatusi) by a sixty-two vote majority, her victory secured parliamentary support for Telavi. She was appointed Minister for Home Affairs. She was the second woman ever to have sat in Tuvalu's Parliament, following Naama Maheu Latasi, who was an MP for Nanumea from 1989 to 1997. Isaia's election put an end to Tuvalu being one of the few countries in the world having no female parliamentarians - although the Tuvaluan national Parliament admittedly consists in only fifteen members. She was also, at the time of her election, sister-in-law to the Governor-General, Iakoba Italeli, her late husband's elder brother. On 1 August 2013, her brother-in-law the Governor-General dismissed Prime Minister Willy Telavi in the context of a political crisis (Telavi had sought to govern without the support of Parliament). The following day, the rest of Cabinet, Isaia included, was voted out of office by parliament, as the opposition now had a clear majority following a by-election. Isaia was not re-elected to parliament in the Tuvaluan general election, 2015. Isaia was succeeded as an MP for Nui by Dr Puakena Boreham who is the third woman appointed as a member to the parliament."

The official return for the 1931 election lists him as Pepene Tango Eketone; the middle name is not mentioned in his Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Eketone was politically active and contested his first general election in 1887, when he stood in the Western Maori electorate; he came third out of five candidates. In the 1890 election, he came second after the incumbent, Hoani Taipua. In the 1896 election, he was one of 13 candidates in the Western Maori electorate and came seventh. He had one last (unsuccessful) attempt of getting elected in the Western Maori electorate in the 1931 general election; of the six candidates, he came fourth."

Gubarev had earlier declared himself leader of the Donbass People's Militia. But since then he has been sidelined by other separatist leaders and was banned from taking part in the 2014 Donbass parliamentary elections. These elections also eliminated the post of \"People's Governor\". Gubarev was not a major figure in local politics prior to the beginning of the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. Shortly after declaring himself \"People's Governor\" on March 6, Gubarev was arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) for \"advocating separatism\" and \"illegal seizure of power\". He faced up to ten years in prison. On 7 May, Gubarev was freed in exchange for SBU officers detained earlier by the Donbass People's Militia."
