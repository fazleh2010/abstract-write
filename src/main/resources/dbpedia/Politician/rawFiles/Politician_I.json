  "text" : "Imad Fayez Mughniyeh (Arabic: عماد فايز مغنية‎‎; 7 December 1962 – 12 February 2008), alias al-Hajj Radwan (الحاج رضوان), was a senior member of Lebanon's Islamic Jihad Organization and Hezbollah. Information about Mughniyeh is limited, but he is generally understood to have been a principal leader and operative for a number of years within Hezbollah's military, intelligence, and security apparatuses. He may also have been among the founders of Hezbollah in the 1980s. He has been described as \"a sort of 'super chief of staff'\" within Hezbollah, who once saw himself as the probable successor to Hassan Nasrallah as the leader of Hezbollah. U.S. and Israeli officials have accused Mughniyeh of association with many bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations, beginning with the Beirut barracks bombing and US embassy bombings, both of which took place in 1983 and killed over 350, as well as the kidnapping of dozens of foreigners in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was indicted in Argentina for his alleged role in the 1992 Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires. The highest-profile attacks for which it is claimed he is responsible took place in the early 1980s, shortly after the founding of Hezbollah, when Mughniyah was in his early twenties. U.S. officials have accused him of killing more United States citizens than any other militant prior to the September 11 attacks, and the bombings and kidnappings he is alleged to have organized are credited with all but eliminating the US military presence in Lebanon in the 1980s. Mughniyeh was known by his nom de guerre al-Hajj Radwan. Mughniyeh was included in the European Union's list of wanted terrorists. and had a US$5 million bounty on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. Mughniyeh was killed on the night of 12 February 2008 by a car bomb that detonated as he passed by on foot, in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood of Damascus, Syria."

Here, Milliken taught himself law and was twice elected alderman and appointed an assistant county judge. In the election of 1854, Milliken defeated Amos Throop, who ran on the Temperance Party ticket, with nearly 60% of the vote. Although Throop was the temperance candidate, after winning the election, Milliken declared himself in favor of temperance as well. He ran for re-election the following year against Levi Boone, of the American Party and lost with 47% of the vote. Following his term as mayor, Milliken stayed in public service, becoming a police magistrate."

On September 27, 2007, Okruashvili was briefly arrested at his party headquarters on the charges of corruption, money laundering, and abuse of office. In 2007 he left Georgia and was granted political asylum in France. He was sentenced to 11-year prison term in Georgia in absentia in March 2008. In October 2010, he, remaining in France, joined Sozar Subari, Levan Gachechiladze and Erosi Kitsmarishvili in the new Georgian Party."

From 1994 to 2010 she was a deputy and in March 2010 she became a senator for the Atacama Region. On 28 February 2014, Allende was selected as president of the Senate, as of 11 March 2014, making her the first woman president of the body in Chilean history. She went to the Maisonette College, and unlike her sisters, was initially attracted to the Catholic Church and received her first communion. In 1962, at the age of 17 she began studying sociology, and joined the university's socialist brigade. Five years later she accompanied her father to the congress of the Socialist Party in Chile. Her first marriage with Sergio Meza, son of Gonzalo Meza Allende, did not last long, but they had a son Gonzal. With her second husband, Romilio Tambutti, she had a daughter named Marcia. On 11 September 1973, the day of the military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet, Isabel was the last person to enter the presidential palace, but after the military begin to bomb the presidential palace and the outcome was already clear, her father ordered the women to leave. Isabel obtained political asylum in Mexico, with her mother and sister, where she spent sixteen years in exile before returning to Chile in 1989, in the final stretch of the military regime. On returning to her homeland, Isabel began a successful political career; after Chile's return to democracy in 1990, she was elected as an MP, presiding over the house between 2003 and 2004, becoming the second woman to head this legislative body, after Adriana Muñoz."

  "text" : "Ida Chong (Chinese: 張杏芳; pinyin: Zhāng Xìngfāng; born 1956 or 1957) was previously British Columbia's Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development and was Minister Responsible for the Asia-Pacific Initiative as well as Minister of Technology, Trade, and Economic Development; Minister of Community Services; and Minister Responsible for Women's and Senior's Services (June 2005 - June 2008); Minister of Advanced Education (December 2004 to June 2005); and Minister of State for Women's and Senior's Services (January - December 2004). She was appointed Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development in March 2011. Chong was the BC Liberal MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. She was first elected in 1996 and was re-elected in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia, Chong began her political career in 1993 as a municipal councillor for the District of Saanich. She ran her own accounting firm with business partner Karen Kesteloo and is a fellow of the Certified General Accountant of BC (FCGA). She was awarded a CGA-BC lifetime membership in September 2014. On September 18, 2014, Chong announced her intention to run for mayor of the City of Victoria in the November 2014 municipal election which she subsequently lost, coming a distant third to new mayor, Lisa Helps and previous mayor Dean Fortin. While Chong lost badly, it was widely speculated that she knew she could not win but instead wanted to ensure previous mayor Fortin, who ran a campaign primarily with backing of the New Democratic Party (NDP), would not win. Chong successfully set the ballot question based on Fortin's mishandling of the Johnson Street Bridge Replacement Project but simply did not have enough voters to make an impact. Fortin ultimately lost to Helps by a mere 89 votes. While Chong's running in a known left-wing municipal election after a long and successful career as a Provincial Cabinet Minister was baffling to many, the speculation is that Chong knew she could pull votes from the moderate Fortin, with a long-term strategy to strengthen the Green/Progressive vote in the region and province thus weakening the New Democratic Party by splitting the leftist vote."

The books became a staple legal source among Indiana’s lawyers and received national and international acclaim for its style, accuracy, quality, and concision in dealing with common law. As a jurist, Blackford was the most influential ever to serve on Indiana's courts, according to former Chief Justice of Indiana Randall Shepard. He was nickname the \"Indiana Blackstone\" because of a comment made by Washington Irving regarding the popularity of Blackford’s books. During his lifetime he was nationally renowned as one of the most prominent jurists in the United States. After graduating from Princeton University, Blackford moved to the Indiana Territory to practice law in 1812. After holding several civil service positions, he was appointed a circuit court judge but resigned just before the territorial government was dissolved in 1816. Elected as a representative to the first session of the Indiana General Assembly, he was chosen to serve as the first Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives. Following the death of Indiana Chief Justice John Johnson in 1817, Blackford was appointed as his replacement by Governor of Indiana Jonathan Jennings. Blackford’s early important cases included Polly v. Lasselle, the decision in that case freed all slaves in Indiana. Nominated without his knowledge or permission, in 1825 he was the Whig candidate for Governor of Indiana, but was defeated in the election because of his refusal to campaign publicly. Again nominated without his knowledge to become a United States Senator, he lost the election in the Indiana General Assembly by only one vote. Blackford was beset by a number of personal tragedies during the 1820s. Following the death of his wife in childbirth, his young son a few years later, then his mother, and narrowly escaping death himself, he became emotionally distraught. He began to live a reclusive lifestyle in a one-room apartment in the Indiana Governor's Mansion, where he remained for over twenty years. There he spent his time with only the companionship of his servant. He left for occasional meals, to attend court sessions, and rarely for business and church, but otherwise remained locked away. It was during his solitude that he began writing the reports for which he became renowned. He was reappointed to his seat on the Supreme Court four times, serving until the adoption of the 1851 Constitution of Indiana, which made his position subject to election rather than appointment. Defeated for the Whig party nomination to run for his office, he left the court in 1852. He was defeated again in the 1853 election to become Supreme Court Reporter, which led him to seek a position on the federal courts after briefly attempting to practice law. Appointed by President Franklin Pierce, he served as a federal court judge of the newly created United States Court of Claims dealing with financial claims against the federal government from 1855 until his death. During his lifetime Blackford accumulated a small fortune through the sale of his reports which was left to his only living relative, his half-sister Charolotte Teresa Coons."

For other people with similarly spelled names, see Ian McDonald (disambiguation).) Ian Michael Macdonald (born 7 March 1949), a former Australian politician, was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1988 to 2010 representing the Australian Labor Party. Between 2003 and 2010, Macdonald held a range of ministerial responsibilities in the Carr, Iemma, Rees, and Keneally ministries. Macdonald, who joined the Labor Party in 1972, had his membership of the party terminated in 2013 for bringing the party into disrepute. After the Independent Commission Against Corruption found that Macdonald acted in a corrupt manner, in November 2014 it was announced that following advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, Macdonald will be prosecuted for the offence of misconduct in public office for corruptly issuing of lucrative mining licences at Doyles Creek in the Hunter Valley."

She was the first woman and first Black person to hold this position. In 1997 she resigned from this job in order to succeed Mosiuoa Lekota as Premier of the Free State Province. She was also the first woman to hold the position of a premier in South Africa. Matsepe-Casaburri was appointed as Minister of Communications in June 1999."

  "text" : "Ivor Malcolm Clemitson  (8 December 1931 – 24 December 1997) was a British Labour politician. Having graduated from the London School of Economics and completed National Service in the Royal Air Force, he trained as a Church of England priest and was ordained in 1958. In order to stand for Parliament in 1974, he had to renounce his orders. At the February 1974 general election, Clemitson was elected as Member of Parliament for Luton East. He lived in the constituency and held his seat at the October 1974 election but, at the 1979 general election, lost by 847 votes to the Conservative Graham Bright. He moved to France with his wife (Janet) and daughter (Suzannah) in the late 1990s and died at his home there, aged 66, just before Christmas 1997. Following his death, his sister, Jean, persuaded the General Synod of the Church of England to permit a stained glass window to be installed in his memory at St Mary's Church in Harlington, Bedfordshire, the village where they had lived for some time during childhood. The window, designed by Petri Anderson, was dedicated in May 2009. Clemitson co-wrote \"A Life to Live: Beyond Full Employment\" (Junction Books, 1981) with George Rogers MP. Clemitson House, a municipal building in the centre of Luton, is named in memory of Clemitson and his father (Daniel), who had served as an alderman on the local council. Clemitson was a lifelong supporter of Luton Town Football Club."

He oversaw the bond issue to build Kansas City International Airport and pushed for construction of the Truman Sports Complex for the Kansas City Chiefs and eventually the Kansas City Royals. He dealt with labor strife during the construction of the two projects and the 1968 Kansas City riot following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King. In April 1968 following the King assassination Davis met with a large group of inner city school students on the steps of City Hall. A police officer fired tear gas canister into the crowd and a riot erupted in which five were to die."

Von Rudhart had received a doctorate of law from the University of Munich, had authored two books, one of them a statistical survey of the Bavarian Kingdom, which he served as a member of the Council of State, prior to his appointment as Prime Minister of Greece. When he arrived in Athens in February, 1837, he was received suspiciously by the English legate Lyons (who had been a supporter of his predecessor, von Armansperg) and immediately found himself at also odds with the king over the role of the prime minister. King Otto was committed to an absolute monarchy and was resistant to a powerful chief minister. Von Rudhart had a series of clashes with king, and being disliked by Queen Amalia, his resignation was accepted by King Otto 10 months after he arrived in Greece. Otto served as his own President of the Privy Council until a constitution was forced on him during the September 3rd Revolution in 1843."

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014."

  "text" : "Iorwerth Rhys Thomas (22 January 1895 – 3 December 1966) was a Welsh Labour Party politician. Thomas was born on 22 January 1895, the son of David William Thomas,a self-employed greengrocer of Cwmparc, Rhondda. He was educated at a local elementary school, and in 1908, at 13 years of age, he began working at the Dare colliery, Cwmdare, Aberdare. He attended evening classes in economics and history in order to improve his education, and in 1918 he joined the Labour Party. In 1922 he was promoted to the position of checkweighman at Cwm-parc. He was a prominent figure within the South Wales Miners' Federation and the National Union of Mineworkers for more than 30 years and held a number of offices in the Park and Dare Lodge, the largest in the south Wales coalfield. During the 1926 coalminers' strike Thomas was sentenced to three months imprisonment as the chairman of the Park and Dare Lodge as a result of his involvement in industrial disturbances. He was elected a member of the Rhondda Borough Council in 1928, chaired many of its committees and served as its chairman in 1938-39. He remained a member until 1951. He served, too, on a number of joint industrial councils for Wales and Monmouthshire, and was a member of the South Wales Electricity Board, 1947-49. In 1950 he was elected for Rhondda West and continued to represent the constituency until his death in 1966. He was much interested in economic and industrial matters. Thomas was a consistent opponent of Welsh nationalism and fought relentlessly against the Parliament for Wales agitation of the 1950s. He publicly attacked Plaid Cymru on several occasions and in October 1965 he was highly critical of the recommendations of the Hughes-Parry Report on the Legal Status of the Welsh Language. In 1960 he supported the Conservative government's measure to open public houses on Sundays. He married in October 1920 Annie Mary, daughter of D.J. Davies. She, too, was active in the Labour politics of the area. She died in July 1956. They had one son and one daughter. Thomas died on 3 December 1966 at his home 94 Park Road, Cwmparc, Rhondda."

He held the seat at the 1951 general election with a majority of only 139 votes, but lost it at the 1955 election to the Conservative candidate John Cordeaux. He contested Nottingham Central again at the 1959 general election, but Cordeaux held the seat with an increased majority. He did not contest the 1964 election, when Labour returned to government under Harold Wilson, but was created a life peer on 14 May 1965, as Baron Winterbottom, of Clopton in the County of Northampton. After Labour's victory at the 1966 general election, he joined the Labour Government, serving as Under-Secretary of State for the Navy until 1967, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Public Building and Works from 1967 to 1968 and finally as Under-Secretary of State for the Air Force from 1968 until the government's defeat at the 1970 general election.

Van Gent focuses on two major themes: solidarity, including housing, social policy, employment, regional and economic policy, and durability, including agriculture, nature and animal rights. Van Gent has voted against the GreenLeft parliamentary party on several important issues: she voted against the marriage of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange and Máxima Zorreguieta, because she is a republican and she spoke out against GreenLeft's support for the invasion of Afghanistan. Van Gent initiated several legislative programs, concerning legal protection for whistle blowers, housing subsidies for students and constitutional protection of animal welfare. She has criticized lavish parties for departing politicians by saying \"you can knock a zero off the price tag for most of them.\" She was opposed to a reduction in benefits to Turkish and Moroccan parents. She has criticized poor railway performance; she said \"They are ‘ready for winter’, except when it snows.\""

  "text" : "Ian Leslie Stuart Blenheim Bradley (10 August 1937 – 20 June 2015) was a regional councillor in Auckland, New Zealand and a former Commander and Temporary Captain in the Royal New Zealand Navy. He was the father of television presenter Sarah Bradley. Born in Hampstead, London, England in 1937, Bradley joined the Royal New Zealand Navy at age 15 and rose through the officer ranks during a 27-year naval career, marked by much success but which ultimately ended in controversy. To the Navy he was a charismatic leader, known for his intellect. He was unquestionably dedicated to the Navy, but he was impatient with red tape; Bradley always said he wanted ‘a thinking Navy’. Bradley joined the RNZN as a Cadet Midshipman in 1953. As was standard for New Zealand officer cadets at the time, his initial training took place ashore in Australia (HMAS Cerberus) before he was sent to the UK for sea training aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Triumph. He returned to New Zealand in 1957; his postings included a year aboard HMNZS Endeavour (the little, wooden-hulled, Antarctic support ship). Ian applied his navigational skill to accurately chart several Antarctic islands. Bradley was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1959. As a recognition of his abilities he was posted to the UK to join the commissioning crew of HMNZS Otago, the first of New Zealand's modern, purpose-built frigates. He specialised in underwater warfare and diving, and returned to the UK for advanced training, where he topped his courses and was awarded the Ogilvy Medal by the Admiralty. These courses were followed by two years loan service with the Royal Navy, including a year at sea in one of the (then) latest anti-submarine frigates HMS Lowestoft. Bradley married and had two daughters but unfortunately the marriage ended in divorce. He remained devoted to his daughters and was proud of their careers. However, his lively charisma also continued to be attractive to many females. Back in New Zealand he was very proud to be appointed to the Royal Yacht BRITANNIA during the 1966 Royal Tour of New Zealand.During the late 1960s he served as director of plans for the RNZN and played a major role in developing the modifications the RNZN made to the design of the 4th frigate the HMNZS Canterbury, a broad beam Leander which was built for the RNZN with an enlarged flight deck to allow helicopters larger than the Wasp, a with the flight deck activity monitored from the Operations Room by cameras on the hangar roof and the associated replacement of the suppressed limbo well with std USN Mk 34 triple torpedo launchers for close in anti-submarine defence with shallow water Mk 44 torpedoes and deep water Mk 46 torpedoes. These modifications were later extended to most RN Leander modernisations. Many other modifications to the Leander design, planned by Ian Bradley, such as the fitting of American sonars and the provision of the 8 km AS-12 missile for the Wasp to engage fast attack craft and surfaced submarines were rejected on political and cost grounds. After continued sea service Bradley was given the important post of Executive Officer (second in command) for the new frigate Canterbury, then building in the UK. He was XO of HMNZS Canterbury from 1971 to 1973, where his reputation as a sailors’ leader was cemented. One Rating recalled “He was an inspirational officer who at times ate in the junior rates mess, allowed more casual clothes for sailors proceeding ashore in civvies, and introduced the beer bar and bbq on the flight deck for all officers and ratings.” Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1973 Bradley completed periods of shore duty, including the Joint Services Staff Course in Australia, but also spent much time taking a B.Com and Master of Public Policy and various affairs including with now deceased Dominion Journalist Helen Paske. Those who heard her description of the Captain couldn't believe such a person could exist in New Zealand; before being appointed in command of HMNZS Waikato in 1977, and as Captain, Eleventh Frigate Squadron. The title ‘Captain F11’ was passed to the senior CO of our four frigates. His command of Waikato included the dramatic rescue of an ill Russian Seaman from a Soviet trawler south of Stewart Island (the helicopter crew were awarded bravery medals). A long deployment to Canada and the US West Coast followed; during that time Waikato was integrated into a US Navy Destroyer Squadron – a unique step for the two Navies. While on one major exercise a US Navy helicopter reported an inflight emergency and needed to land. Although the exercise commander ordered another frigate (without a flight deck) to rescue the air crew (implicitly accepting the loss of the helicopter) Ian realised that Waikato’s flight deck (recently enlarged in the Devonport dockyard to accommodate the Lynx helicopter) could just accommodate the big Sea King that was in distress. He raced Waikato towards the American helicopter and it was able to land (diagonally) on the frigate with just moments of fuel remaining. Subsequently the US naval aviators could not do enough for Waikato wherever it went on the West Coast. In his book ‘Don’t Rock the Boat’ Ian has left a detailed account of Waikato’s diplomatic and representational role during what were high-profile port visits. In Vancouver he developed a relationship with a young Canadian Forces bandswoman. Although the age difference ultimately ended their romance, Ian wrote later that if he had married her maybe the events that ended his career would not have occurred. In 1979 he was appointed as Chief of Staff to the Commodore Auckland in the rank of Temporary Captain, with the responsibility of reorganising the Command Support Organisation. He initiated several innovative ideas, and he was appointed to command the new organisation on its inception in 1980. However, Bradley left Auckland one weekend for social reasons, and was subsequently accused of abandonment of his command and deserting his post. The Chief of Naval Staff of the time saw that as deserving punishment. Bradley was demoted to his substantive rank of Commander and allocated an office without a function and, proud and determined to the end, recognised he had effectively been relieved from the Navy and resigned from the RNZN. In the following two years he dabbled in TV film production and commentated on defence for the media and TV, notably clashing with the Minister of Defence over a poorly edited 1982 Listener article in which Bradley claimed that the Navy was going nowhere, that frigates like the RNZN Type 12's and Leanders, could not be economically modernised and that the performance of RNZN type frigates in the Falklands war had been disastrous and that they contributed nothing, and privately went further in his own defence, stating that frigates like HMS Plymouth far from performing well were so useless that the Argentine Navy and Air Force would never have wasted a bomb attacking, HMS Plymouth or Yarmouth, unless no other target was available and that the British Type 12s Plymouth and Yarmouth were effectively Leander class frigates of the same standard as HMNZS Canterbury and HMS Bachantee which the RNZN was receiving second hand, after their late 1960s reconstruction and were not of the same class as HMNZ Otago at all. It has since emerged that the Argentine pilots never attacked the elderly RN T12s in Falkland Sound and that the Task Force Commanders Admiral Sandy Woodward and Captain John Coward regarded the Plymouth and Yarmouth as heroic, but useless and worse and constantly anticipated their reduction to burning rubble. The main interest of Ian Bradley at the time was opposing the government's plan to convert to RNZN to submarines which he considered a fantasy. Bradley, who loved cars, in 1983 bought a garage in Devonport, taking a particular delight in serving many of the sailors who continued to support him. Bradley was determined to regain his honour as a commissioned officer. He brought a lawsuit against the Navy, which he lost, an outcome which he believed to be a miscarriage of justice. His position was that he would have eventually become Chief of the Defence Force, and certain powers found that prospect unacceptable, hence his dismissal. He continued to pursue the Navy and ultimately won an acknowledgement from the Governor-General that he had been unjustly treated. It was of course too late to reinstate his career. He went into local politics after his naval career, initially with the Devonport Borough Council (1983–86) and Auckland Regional Authority (1986–88) before serving in the Auckland Regional Council. Later, Ian joined the Department of Conservation where his work in the Auckland Conservancy proved to be dedicated, innovative and valuable. After leaving the navy, he also competed in Ironman events. He died suddenly in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, on 20 June 2015."

As chairman of the JSP from 1977 to 1983, he attempted to expand the party's membership and realign its platform to a more European-style social democratic model, but was largely unsuccessful in boosting the party's standing."

  "text" : "Irvin Neil \"Irv\" Anderson (June 18, 1923 – November 17, 2008) was a Minnesota politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1965 to 1983, and again from 1991 to 2007. From International Falls, Anderson entered politics at approximately the same time that he was elected union president at the M & O Paper Company, the International Falls paper mill where he worked. A Democrat, he represented the old District 64 and 64B and, later, District 3A. The sprawling district included all or portions of Beltrami, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake of the Woods and St. Louis counties in the northern part of the state. Anderson served as majority leader of the House from 1973 to 1981, and again, briefly, in 1993 before becoming Speaker of the House in September 1993, a position he held until 1997. He continued to serve in the legislature until 2007, opting not to run for re-election in 2006 due to health concerns. Anderson fought in World War II as a United States Navy pilot from 1942 to 1945, earning the Air Medal for his performance. The Air Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Armed Forces of the United States, distinguishes themselves by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight. He also helped create Minnesota's memorial to World War II veterans. Anderson died at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids on November 17, 2008. He was buried in St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Cemetery in International Falls. On April 15, 2009, Governor Tim Pawlenty approved a bill designating U.S. Highway 53 from Virginia to International Falls as the Irv Anderson Memorial Highway."

He served until August 2009.

  "text" : "Ivan Steshenko (June 24, 1873, Poltava – August 1, 1918, Poltava) was a Ukrainian civic and political activist, writer, translator, member of the Ukrainian government, and member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. He had several pen-surnames: Serdeshny, Sichovyk, Svitlenko, and Stepura. Steshenko had a wife Oksana Steshenko, a daughter and a son: Iryna and Yaroslav. Ivan was a son-in-law to Mykhailo Starytskyi, father of Oksana. Ivan studied in Kiev University from 1892 to 1896. At that time he was an active member of the Literary Hromada of Kiev. Steshenko was publishing his works in various Lviv periodicals: Pravda, Zoria, and Dzvinok. After graduating from the Department of History and Philosophy in 1896, he worked as a teacher in women's school, gymnasium. In politics he became influenced by Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykola Kovalevsky. Later together with other activists such as Lesia Ukrainka he formed the Ukrainian social-democratic club (circle). At about that time he wrote his drama Mazepa. After all this he was put in prison in 1897 for four months, following exile from Kiev and prohibition of teaching. That forced him to go into intense writing. At that time he was preparing the Ukrainian dictionary, wrote a book about Kotliarevsky's work (1898), and its own poetry collections such as Khutorni Sonety (Farmstead sonnets, 1899) and Steppovi Motyvy (Steppe Motifs, 1900). He also was publishing various articles in the newspaper Kievskaya Starina. Upon returning to Kiev, he became the leader of the Hromada society and worked closely with the Society of Ukrainian Progressionists. He also became a secretary of the Kiev Literary-Artistic Society before it was closed in 1905. At about that time he published the biography of Kotliarevsky (1902) and was co-publisher of a magazine Shershen (1905). After he was reinstated as a teacher in 1906, from 1907 to 1917 he was teaching literature in the First Commercial School in Kiev and Lysenko Music and Drama School. During that time he was also a secretary and a deputy-chairman of the Ukrainian Scientific Society. In 1913–14 he was an editor for the Kiev monthly periodical Siayvo, and in 1908 he published a history of Ukrainian drama. After the October Revolution he was elected as the member of the Kiev Civic Executive Committee and the Tsentralna Rada. Steshenko also was one of the founders of the Society of School Education. Later he was appointed first as the Secretary and then as the Minister of Education. Steshenko also founded the State Academy of Arts. Soon Steshenko was murdered while on vacation. His assassin was never found. Ivan Steshenko was buried in the Baikove Cemetery in Kiev. Out of his translations were works of Ovid, von Schiller, Pushkin, Byron, and others. Serhiy Yefremov while on the way to Poltava wrote in his diary: \"I just found out from Kost Ivanovych [Tovkach] scary details about the murder of Steshenko. He was charged to be killed by the regional Bolshevik organization of the Zinkiv Povit, and was executed by one of the members of the organization. His name's Bashlovka. The reason why Steshenko was sentenced to be executed is unknown.\""

From 2008 to 2013 he was a member of the federal parliament for the Arau constituency in Perlis. He is a member of the governing United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party and the brother of the former Chief Minister of Perlis, Shahidan Kassim. Early in his political career, Ismail served as the head of UMNO's youth wing in Perlis. He contested the federal seat of Arau in a by-election in 1998, but was defeated by Hashim Jasin of PAS. His candidacy in 1998 was marred by accusations of cronyism arising from his brother's position as Menteri Besar of Perlis. At the time, UMNO was bleeding support due to allegations by supporters of UMNO leadership contender Anwar Ibrahim of cronyism and nepotism within the party. Selecting the brother of the state's Chief Minister as UMNO's candidate did little to neutralise the allegations. Ismail's defeat was the first time that UMNO had lost a parliamentary seat in Perlis to PAS. Ismail was later appointed to the Dewan Negara (Senate), before re-contesting and winning Arau ten years later, in the 2008 general election, defeating his Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) opponent by a 300-vote margin. His predecessor, Syed Razlan Syed Putra, had held the seat with a majority of 3,243. For the 2013 election, Ismail switched seats with his brother, Shahidan: Ismail moved to the Perlis State Assembly, winning the seat of Tambun Tulang, which his brother had held since 1995, while Shahidan contested and won the federal seat of Arau."

  "text" : "Ivan Kramberger () also styled as the \"benefactor of Negova\" (Slovene: dobrotnik iz Negove) (May 4, 1936 – June 7, 1992) was a Slovenian inventor, writer, philanthropist, and politician. Kramberger was born in Negova, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He was one of eleven children born to a poor family. He made his fortune in Germany, where he worked in a hospital as a technician and patented a series of improvements for a dialysis machine. The money he obtained through his invention was distributed among poor people in Slovenia in a Robin Hood manner, and also for purchasing dialysis machines for hospitals in Slovenia. He lived in modest conditions with his wife and children. He was known for his hobby of collecting and repairing vintage cars. He was a very eccentric figure in the Slovene media and politics. As a populist figure, he held political speeches on Prešeren Square in Ljubljana. He had the ability to make long speeches without using notes. With popular backing, he was one of the Slovene presidential candidates in the 1990 elections, in which he obtained 18.5% of the votes and placed third. In 1992 he said that he would not campaign any longer for the presidency, but he wanted to enter parliament with his political party. He was assassinated under unusual circumstances before the campaign started. The presumed shooter, Peter Rotar, was drunk; he was charged with shooting from a great distance and was sentenced to prison. The motivation and circumstances for the murder remain unexplained."

Following Brian Burke's resignation in 1988 he became Minister for Police in Peter Dowding's ministry and on Carmen Lawrence's ascension to the premiership in 1990 he became Deputy Premier and Minister for Finance (although his portfolio varied during this time) corresponding to Premier Lawrence also being the Treasurer. Labor was defeated at the 1993 state election and Taylor became Leader of the Opposition in February 1994 when Lawrence resigned to enter federal parliament. He was succeeded by Jim McGinty in October. In 1996 he resigned to contest the federal seat of Kalgoorlie against Labor rebel Graeme Campbell, who defeated him as an independent. He was the first WA Labor leader in decades not to take the party into an election. In 2000 Taylor announced his intention to leave the ALP over the treatment of former Labor politician Larry Graham."

  "text" : "Israel Nogueda Otero (January 16, 1935 – June 15, 2012) was a Mexican politician, economist and member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Nogueda served as the Municipal President of Acapulco municipality from 1969 to 1971 and the Governor of Guerrero from 1971 until 1975. Nogueda Otero was born in Atoyac de Álvarez, Guerrero, Mexico, on January 16, 1935. He earned a degree in economics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In April 1971, Nogueda became the Governor of Guerrero following the death of his predecessor, Caritino Maldonado Pérez, who died in office. During Nogueda's tenure, the state government faced a guerrilla insurgency led by Genaro Vázquez Rojas and Lucio Cabañas, who operated in Guerrero. Noting the worsening crisis in Guerrero, the federal Congress of the Union removed Governor Israel Nogueda Otero from office in January 1975. Congress appointed a new interim governor, Xavier Olea Muñoz, who was sworn into office on January 31, 1975, as Nogueda's successor. He later served on an internal state commissioner for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Nogueda Otero died of a heart attack shortly after 11 p.m. on June 15, 2012, at his home in Mexico City at the age of 77. He was buried in Atoyac de Álvarez."
