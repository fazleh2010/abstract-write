In 1984, he resigned from the service to contest elections as a member of the Indian National Congress party. He won the election and served as a union minister of state until 1989. Thereafter, he had a patchy political career until being made India's foreign minister in 2004. However, 18 months later, he had to resign under a cloud after the UN's Volcker committee named both him and the Congress party to which he belonged as beneficiaries of illegal pay-offs in the Iraqi oil scam."

  "text" : "Norman McFarlane (born in Apohaqui, New Brunswick) was the 64th Mayor of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. He was first elected on May 10, 2004, and sworn into office on Tuesday, May 25. He was defeated in the New Brunswick municipal elections, 2008 by Ivan Court. McFarlane worked for Royal Insurance in Saint John from 1953 to 1993, retiring as Branch Manager. Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges. McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc. McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary's key backers was Abel LeBlanc. Mayor McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million."

He later settled in Capreol, Ontario, where he worked as a railway conductor and a union activist before entering municipal politics, serving as a municipal councillor and deputy mayor beginning in 1962. Fawcett won a 1965 by-election brought on by the resignation of Osias Godin. He represented Nickel Belt for three years, and was defeated by Liberal candidate Gaetan Serré in the 1968 election. Following his defeat, he was re-elected to Capreol's town council as mayor in 1969, serving four years. After two years out of office, he was reelected to town council in 1975, serving as councillor and deputy mayor until his retirement from politics in 1991. Following his death in 1997, statements of tribute were delivered in the House of Commons by Raymond Bonin, John Williams, Elsie Wayne, Bill Blaikie and René Laurin. Fawcett's daughter is married to Elie Martel, who was the Member of Provincial Parliament for Sudbury East from 1967 to 1987. Shelley Martel, Elie Martel's daughter and Fawcett's granddaughter, won election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario upon Elie Martel's retirement, and continued to represent the riding of Nickel Belt until her own retirement from politics in 2007.

Following the controversy surrounding Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's admitted substance abuse and further allegations of inappropriate conduct, the Toronto City Council voted on November 15, 2013 and November 18, 2013 to remove the non-statutory mayoral powers from Ford and grant them to Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1. Even though Kelly had all the powers of the mayoral office for 3 months, Ford still technically held the title of Mayor, while Kelly was still referred to as the Deputy Mayor."

  "text" : "Noah Noble (January 15, 1794 – February 8, 1844) was the fifth Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1831 to 1837. His two terms focused largely on internal improvements, culminating in the passage of the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act, which was viewed at the time as his crowning achievement. His taxing recommendations to pay for the improvements were not fully enacted, and the project ultimately led the state to negotiate a partial bankruptcy only a few years later. The debacle led to a gradual collapse of the state Whig party, which never regained control of the government, and led to a period of Democratic control that lasted until the middle of the American Civil War. After his term as governor he was appointed to the Board of Internal Improvement where he unsuccessfully advocated a reorganization of the projects in an attempt to gain some benefit from them."

  "text" : "Nicholas David \"Nick\" Coleman (February 23, 1925 – March 5, 1981) was a Minnesota politician and a former member and majority leader of the Minnesota Senate. A Democrat, he was first elected in 1962 and reelected in 1966, 1970, 1972, and 1976. He represented the old districts 45, 46, and 65, which changed through the years due to legislative redistricting, and included portions of the city of Saint Paul in Ramsey County. Born in Saint Paul, Coleman served as a Signalman 2nd Class in the United States Navy during World War II. He entered politics as a volunteer for the 1948 congressional campaign of Eugene McCarthy, then a professor at the College of St. Thomas (now the University of St. Thomas), where Coleman was a student. He was later Minnesota chair for the 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon Johnson. While in the Senate, Coleman served as an assistant minority leader from 1967 to 1970, as minority leader during the 1971–1972 biennium, and as the first Democrat in 114 years to become majority leader—a position he held from 1973 until leaving the Senate in 1981. The Democrats have held the majority in that chamber of the Minnesota Legislature until January, 2011. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the DFL Party's endorsement for governor in 1970, and for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Coleman was a founder and partner of the advertising agency Coleman-Goff Advertising, later known as Coleman and Christison. He was the father of Chris Coleman, the current mayor of St. Paul, of Minnesota journalist Nick Coleman, and of the Acquisitions Librarian at the Minnesota Historical Society Library, Patrick K. Coleman. Prior to his career in advertising, he was a high school teacher for two years in the rural town of Tyler, MN. Coleman died of leukemia on March 5, 1981. His body lay in state in the Minnesota State Capitol before burial in Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis."

  "text" : "John Nicholas Udall usually called Nick Udall (July 23, 1913 – June 15, 2005) was mayor of Phoenix, Arizona from 1948–52. He was a member of the Udall political family and was also a nephew of Spencer W. Kimball, the 12th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Udall was born and raised in Arizona. His parents John Hunt Udall and Ruth Kimball were in the same English literature class at the St. Joseph Stake Academy (now Eastern Arizona College), and when learning about playwright Nicholas Udall, they joked that if they ever got married, that they would name their son Nick, which they did. Udall attended Brigham Young University and the University of Arizona before enrolling in The George Washington University Law School, graduating in 1943. After graduation, he returned home to Arizona, where he began his law practice. He followed in his father's footsteps, and served as mayor of Phoenix from 1948 to 1952. He served with then-City Councilman Barry Goldwater. From 1952 to 1956 he served as judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court. Nick left the bench to return to private legal practice at Jennings, Strouss, Salmon & Trask in Phoenix, where he practiced law until retiring in 1992. A lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Nick served in various church positions, including service as a full-time missionary in the Eastern Central States mission from 1934 to 1936, as Bishop of the Phoenix Third Ward from 1970 to 1975 (\"the most satisfying calling that a worthy priesthood holder can have\" because \"he is continually helping people\"), and as Patriarch of the Phoenix Arizona Stake from 1975 to 1991. Nick and his wife, Sybil Elizabeth Webb, are the parents of seven children. They are buried alongside each other in Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona. Following Sybil's death in 1998, Nick married Joan Romney in 2001. His autobiography, \"The Wonder of It All,\" was published by FCP Publishing in 2006."

  "text" : "Nellie Cournoyea, OC (born March 4, 1940 in Aklavik, Northwest Territories) is a Canadian politician, who served as the sixth Premier of the Northwest Territories from 1991 to 1995. She was the first female premier of a Canadian territory and the second female premier in Canadian history after Rita Johnston of British Columbia. Cournoyea is of mixed Norwegian and Inupiaq heritage. Before entering politics, Cournoyea was an announcer and station manager for CBC North in Inuvik, and a land claims worker for the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada. She was first elected to the territorial Legislative Assembly in 1979, representing the electoral district of Western Arctic until it was dissolved in 1983, and then the new district of Nunakput for the remainder of her career in politics. She served the government in a variety of cabinet positions. On November 14, 1991, she was chosen as premier under the territory's consensus government system, in which the premier is chosen by elected members following the general election. Cournoyea served as premier until 1995, and subsequently chose not to stand for reelection to the Legislative Assembly. She currently serves as chair and CEO of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation. She was a winner of a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, in 1994, and has been awarded honorary doctorates in law from Lakehead University, Carleton University and the University of Toronto. In 2008, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada as well as inducted into the Aboriginal Business Hall of Fame. As a child, Cournoyea attended an aboriginal residential school. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report described how she was sheltered by Aboriginal families along her route when she ran away from an Anglican hostel in the Northwest Territories after a confrontation with a teacher."

He was first elected to a six-year Senate term in the federal parliament as an independent at the 2007 federal election and was re-elected at the 2013 federal election, before forming the nascent NXT and electing a total of four representatives including one in the lower house at the 2016 federal election. Xenophon was first elected to South Australian parliament at the 1997 state election before an unprecedented result at the 2006 state election, which propelled him to federal parliament. Xenophon first contested a parliamentary seat and was unexpectedly successful at the 1997 state election. Despite an upper house primary vote of just 2.9 percent, his independent No Pokies ticket collected many preferences and reached the upper house electoral quota of 8.3 percent, making him the first successful upper house independent in several decades. Campaigning to retain his seat at the 2006 state election, he received unexpected and unprecedented levels of support, with an upper house primary vote of 20.5 percent, resulting in a total of three successful upper house candidates. A year later he stood down to contest the 2007 federal election and was elected to the Senate with an upper house primary vote of 14.8 percent. This increased to 24.9 percent at the 2013 election. The nascent NXT ran candidates in most states and territories including all South Australian seats at the 2016 federal election. As the election was a double dissolution the Senate electoral quota of 14.3 percent was halved to 7.7 percent. Though NXT's South Australian Senate primary vote was reduced to 21.7 percent, the halved Senate quota resulted in three successful NXT candidates in the upper house alone. NXT was also successful in the South Australian Division of Mayo in the lower house. While his original No Pokies platform centred on an anti-gambling policy, he has since become an advocate in many other policy areas. These include defence, education, health, infrastructure, regional affairs, national security, foreign policy, and civil liberties."

  "text" : "Noah Shakespeare (January 26, 1839 – May 13, 1921) was a Canadian politician from British Columbia noted for his involvement in the anti-Chinese movement. Shakespeare was born in Staffordshire, England, arriving in Victoria, British Columbia in 1863. Shakespeare was involved in the photography business, running a gallery and acting as an agent for others. He made an early run for office as an independent candidate in the second British Columbia election in 1875, coming fourth in a two-member district. Shakespeare was a leader in the anti-Chinese movement in the city. He became president of the Workingmen’s Protective Association in 1878. The short-lived organization was established to lobby for restrictions on Chinese immigration during the 1878 election. Shakespeare’s politics were popular in the Victoria of his day. He was elected mayor in 1882. He was also elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament that year, defeating former B.C. Premier Amor De Cosmos in the Victoria district. Shakespeare was re-elected in 1887 but resigned his seat only three months later to become Postmaster for Victoria."

Spearing then returned to parliament a few weeks later after winning the Newham South by-election (caused by the constituency's MP, Elwyn Jones, being made a life peer in order to take on the role of Lord Chancellor) with a majority of 9,321. This was the only by-election held in the February–October 1974 Parliament. Spearing was then re-elected at the October 1974 general election, and held the Newham South seat until 1997, when he was deselected in favour of Jim Fitzpatrick.

He starting Basic Education school with help of Birla Trust in every village of Luharu- Jind state now district Bhiwani. Having served as a minister in the government of Jind, Takshak was involved in the wrangling that resulted from the formation in 1948 of the short-lived state known as the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). There were three organisations vying to hold the reins of power, being the Akali Dal, Lok Sewak Dal and the Praja Mandal. The latter suffered from internal rivalries and Takshak – along with Zail Singh, Seth Ram Nath and Harcharan Singh – were encouraged to split from it by forming the Pepsu Pradesh Congress Committee. They entered the government of Gian Singh Rarewala, which was sworn in on 13 January 1949. He became Education and Finance minister for the new state. Later, in 1953, he was among a group of MLAs who rebelled against the Indian National Congress government of Raghbir Singh, causing it to collapse and Rarewala once again to assume power. The Hindu has said that he was the first example of a politician changing allegiance in India. The action was later to stigmatise him. He founded Birhi teacher training school and Art craft teacher training in Arya Hindi Maha Vidyalaya Charkhi Dadri. A statue in his honour was unveiled at Bhagwi in 2007."

  "text" : "Evelyn Nigel Chetwode Birch, Baron Rhyl, PC, OBE (18 November 1906 – 8 March 1981) was a British Conservative politician. The son of General Sir Noel Birch and his wife Florence Chetwode, Nigel Birch was educated at Eton. He was a partner in Cohen Laming Hoare until May 1939 when he retired to study politics. He served in World War II in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and on General Staff, being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1944. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1945. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Flintshire from 1945 to 1950 and for West Flintshire from 1950 to 1970. He served in government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air from 1951 to 1952, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Defence from 1952 to 1954, Minister of Works from October 1954 to December 1955, Secretary of State for Air from December 1955 to January 1957 and Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 1957 to 1958. His resignation in 1958, along with that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft and fellow Treasury Minister Enoch Powell, was described by Harold Macmillan as \"little local difficulties\". He exacted his revenge when, in the wake of the Profumo scandal, he attacked the Macmillan government and quoted in his memorable speech the devastating words of Robert Browning on William Wordsworth: \"Never glad confident morning again\". His speech showed Macmillan as weak and out of touch, and it sealed Birch's reputation of being as deadly as Leo Amery. In 1950 he married Esmé Glyn, the daughter of the 4th Baron Wolverton. In 1955, he was appointed a Privy Counsellor, and on 7 July 1970, he was created a life peer as Baron Rhyl, of Holywell in the parish of Swanmore in the County of Southampton."

On 25 May 2013, several Congress leaders were killed in a Naxalite attack on a Congress convoy. At first, Naxalites kidnapped Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel keeping up the hopes of their coming back alive. However, their bullet-ridden bodies were found in the Jiram valley in the Bastar district the next day. On the 27 May, the Naxalites claimed responsibility for the attack by issuing a statement which called it a punishment for atrocities committed by the Salwa Judum who is counter-Naxalite paramilitary forces in the Bastar area and that it was originally targeted at its leader, Mahendra Karma."

Hosaka campaigned and won the mayor's job on an anti-nuclear platform in April 2011, just over a month after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hosaka \"is determined to turn this city ward of 840,000 people, the largest in Tokyo, into the front-runner of a movement that will put an end to Japan's reliance on atomic power and accelerate the use of renewable energy\". Hosaka opposes the death penalty, and held the position of secretary general of the Parliamentary League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. He is also highly critical of continued Japanese moral panic against the Otaku subculture in the nation, with one notable case of criticism displayed against public and media related assumptions and gossip surrounding the incidents of November 17, 2004, when Kaoru Kobayashi murdered a 7-year-old girl. In 2006 and 2007, Hosaka joined the gay parade in Tokyo. Mizuho Fukushima, then-leader of the Social Democratic Party, also joined the event him in 2007."

He unsuccessfully contested the Faversham constituency in 1931 and 1935, and was elected at the 1945 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham South. He held that seat until for ten years, until his defeat at the 1955 election by the Conservative Party candidate Denis Keegan. An outspoken MP, he was known for not always following the Government brief: “Mr. Smith has the engaging quality of hitting hard without making personal charges against the integrity and motives of those who think differently. He said many things that made the House gasp, and many that made it laugh...\" With Robert Boothby he was almost alone in condemnation of the Bretton Woods system. He also found Keynesian economics wanting. In his book Politics of Plenty (published 1944) he warned his readers of the dangers of Keynes: “In due course the Keynes plan for an irresponsible world financial government came to maturity and, by hole and corner methods for which Britain's third Labour Government must share responsibility, was thrust on an unsuspecting world.\" He complained that British politics regarded financial policy as being something over and above party strife; to accept the rules of orthodox financial practice as being conventions to which all political parties must defer. He was a supporter of Social Credit – believing that it could solve the problems of modern banking, highlighted by the 1930s depression. He wrote many articles supporting Social Credit."

They received the prize for their struggles for protection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) from plans of oil exploration and drilling. Oil and gas exploration would disturb the life cycle of the Porcupine caribou, which has been the foundation for the Gwich'in culture for 20000 years. In 2010 she was elected as Chief of the Vuntut Gwitchin."

  "text" : "Dame Nicola Mary Brewer DCMG is a British diplomat and university administrator. In May 2014 she was appointed Vice-Provost (International) at University College London. This came shortly after her resignation as Chief Executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, following controversial comments suggesting that equal pay audits should be removed from an equalities bill. She is a non-executive director of Aggreko. Brewer was British High Commissioner to South Africa from 2009 to 2013. Brewer joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1983, completing overseas postings in South Africa, India, France and Mexico. She served as the FCO's Director for Global Issues from 2001 to 2002, and then as Director-General for Regional Programmes at the Department for International Development (DfID), the DfID board member supervising the UK's overseas bilateral aid programmes. In 2004, she was appointed Director-General for Europe at the FCO, leading the FCO's contribution to the UK's 2005 Presidency of the European Union, advising the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Europe on European Union and other European policy issues. In December 2006, Brewer was appointed by open competition as the first Chief Executive of the newly established Equality and Human Rights Commission, the successor body to the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission. She took up her new position in March 2007, standing down in May 2009 to succeed Paul Boateng as British High Commissioner to South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, completing her mission in September 2013. On her return to the UK, she became the Founding Director of the FCO Diplomatic Academy. Nicola Brewer was educated at the Belfast Royal Academy, and read English at the University of Leeds, graduating with a BA in 1980, then taking a Doctorate in linguistics in 1988 there. Leeds granted her an Honorary Doctorate of Laws in 2009. She was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2003 New Year Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) in the 2011 Birthday Honours. She is married to former diplomat Geoffrey Gillham: they have two children. Her father, Trevor Brewer, played international rugby for Wales in the 1950s."

  "text" : "N. Gopala Menon was a lawyer and an Indian politician of the Indian National Congress, also Member of the Legislative Assembly of Madras state. He served as the Speaker of the Madras Legislative Assembly from 1955 to 1956. Soon after the untimely death of his father (Ulanat Mootha Pannicker, a chieftain of the Zamorin of Calicut), Gopal’s mother with her six small children moved to Madras (the erstwhile Madras Presidency ). Gopal did his schooling and higher studies in the Madras Christian College High School and graduate studies at Madras Christian College and the Law College, Madras. After qualifying in Law he joined the Legal firm of Sir Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu who became his mentor. Sir KV Reddy, was the first Indian to be appointed Governor of a Presidency, when he became the Governor of the Madras Presidency in June 1936. Gopala Menon set up his private law practice in Madras in the early 1920s, getting a good start from the extensive practice of Sir Reddy, a part of which was turned over to him. Always a person who was sympathetic to the conditions of the under-privileged, Gopala Menon devoted his legal practice to the requirements of the needy. He virtually adopted a large cluster of poor households in Vepery and Choolai districts for whom he provided free legal service. He represented this Municipal constituency in the Madras Corporation for nearly twenty years from the early 1930s. During his Membership of the Madras Corporation he was for many terms the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and other important Committees, and was elected the Deputy Mayor for a term. He was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1952, (see Madras Legislative Assembly election, 1952) from the Ponnani constituency in the South Malabar district of Madras Presidency . This was a landmark victory as in these elections, the Communist Party of India and the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party had made a strong showing and his was one of only 5 victories for the INC out of 31 constituencies in what later became Kerala state. In September 1955 he was elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Madras State (see List of Speakers of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly), the precursor of the present Tamil Nadu state. He was only the second person to occupy this office, following the first ever Speaker of the newly created Madras State J. Shivashanmugam Pillai who served from May 1952 to August 1955. He published a book on Parliamentary Practices, which served as a handbook for newly elected law makers, who were unfamiliar with the subject."

While his party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament, Letnick was not initially included in the cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Health where he was chair and tasked to report on the impacts of baby boomers and alternative strategies on the health care system. As a private member Letnick also introduced one piece of legislation, the Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act, which was adopted by government. This was the first time in six years that a private member was successful in introducing and getting legislation passed in the legislature. Prior to his election to the legislature, he was a business professor at the Okanagan School of Business. He graduated from Heriot-Watt University with a Master of Business Administration and achieved candidacy status toward a Doctorate in Health Economics with the University of British Columbia before setting the PhD aside to focus on his public duties as minister of agriculture. He served as a municipal councillor in the Town of Banff in the 1990s and in the City of Kelowna between 2005 and 2009."

Yamamoto's party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament and Premier Gordon Campbell included her in his cabinet, between June 2009 and October 2010, as Minister of State for Intergovernmental Relations, and then as Minister of State for Building Code Renewal between October 2010 and March 2011. Following the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election, in which Yamamoto endorsed George Abbott, the new Premier, Christy Clark, promoted Yamamoto to Minister of Advanced Education. Yamamoto has introduced one piece of legislation, the Advanced Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2011, which sought to implement several measures, including expanding the Personal Education Number system which tracks students in the BC educational system to also include private educational institutions, specifying that board members of colleges and universities are to act in the best interests of the institution, and updating the Architectural Institute of BC's dispute resolution process. The bill was introduced on November 3, 2011, but was not adopted before the winter break. Prior to her election to the legislature, Yamamoto owned and operated a business that started as a specialty shop for laser printing but evolved to focus on design and had created props for the television and film industry. She spent time on the governing boards of Capilano College, the North Shore Credit Union, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, and the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation. She completed one term as president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and worked as the president and general manager of the North Vancouver Chamber of Commerce from 2007 until she was elected as MLA."

In September 2009, Gobalakrishnan was arrested for allegedly using criminal force to obstruct a police officer. He was found guilty and fined 3,000 ringgit. In December 2010, he spoke out against his party's leader, Anwar Ibrahim, suggesting that he make way for his daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar. He resigned from the party the following month to sit as an independent, announcing plans to form a non-governmental organisation. He recontested Padang Serai at the 2013 election, having unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the Barisan Nasional coalition. Without a party ticket he garnered less than one percent of the vote and lost his deposit. Gobalakrishnan was born in 1960 in Sitiawan. He is married to Vasanthi Ramalingam, a former athlete, and has three children."

  "text" : "(This is a Malay name; the name Mat Isa is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Nasharudin.) Haji Nasharudin Mat Isa (born 19 October 1962) is a former Member of the Parliament of Malaysia. He was born in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.He represented the constituency of Yan, Kedah, from 1999 to 2004, and the seat of Bachok, Kelantan, from 2008 to 2013. From 2005 to 2011 he was the Deputy President of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Nasharudin attended the University of Glasgow. Before entering active politics, he was a lecturer at the International Islamic University of Malaysia. In 1999 he left academia to take up the post of PAS's Secretary-General, making him the party's top administrative officer. He was hand-picked for the position by the party's President, Fadzil Noor, who had brought Nasharudin and other urban professionals into PAS during the 1990s to modernise the party. 1999 also saw Nasharudin's election to Parliament for the seat of Yan. In 2004 Nasharudin lost his parliamentary seat when he switched to run for the Besut seat in Terengganu. The following year, he became the Deputy President of PAS, making him the party's second-most senior elected leader after the President, Abdul Hadi Awang. Nasharudin's election to the position was a surprise: the senior cleric Haron Din had been slated to run against the incumbent, Hassan Shukri, but withdrew due to illness. In Haron's absence, Nasharudin defeated Hassan by a narrow margin. In 2008, he returned to Parliament, winning the seat of Bachok in Kelantan. The following year, he won re-election as Deputy President of PAS, defeating two other candidates. His victory was seen by observers as a win for PAS' conservatives. However, he was ultimately defeated for re-election in 2011 by moderate candidate Mohamed Sabu. During his deputy presidency, Nasharudin had been one of PAS' leading proponents of entering talks with its long-time opponents UMNO to establish a ruling Malay coalition between UMNO and PAS. After travelling to Gaza in 2013 with UMNO's president, and Malaysia's Prime Minister, Najib Tun Razak, he was expelled from PAS's governing council. He did not recontest his parliamentary seat at the 2013 election. Having left both PAS's leadership and the Parliament in 2013, Nasharudin became chairman of the Nassar Foundation, a non-government organisation concerned with Islamic matters. From this position he spoke out against the use of the word \"Allah\" by Christians to describe God, and led protests against what he perceived as the lack of support from the Egyptian military government for people in Gaza. Nasharuddin is also currently the CEO of the Global Movement of Moderates Foundation (GMMF), an organization established by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as a referral point for the consolidation and dissemination of information and material pertaining to moderation. He speaks Malay, Arabic, English, and Urdu."

In 2005, while Deputy Minister for Internal Security, Noh made international news for his role in a controversy concerning the alleged mistreatment of an ethnic Chinese woman by Malaysian police. In response to the revelation of mistreatment and protests by the Chinese government, Noh stated \"if foreigners think that Malaysia police are brutal, please go back to their own countries and not to stay here\". Noh was reprimanded by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, and Noh issued an apology for his comments that BBC News described as 'grudging at best'. Noh was appointed to the federal Cabinet after the 2008 election as Minister for Entrepreneur and Co-operative Development. On 10 April 2009, he was appointed as Minister for Agriculture and Agro-based Industry by Abdullah's successor, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak. Najib dropped him from the Cabinet after the 2013 election."

  "text" : "Nathan Murphy (born 18 August 1977) is an Australian politician. On 9 March 2010, he was appointed to the Victorian Legislative Council as a Labor member for Northern Metropolitan Region to replace Theo Theophanous, who retired. Murphy was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and received his VCE from Parade College in Bundoora. He later qualified for a Bachelor of Arts at La Trobe University. In 2000 he was National Welfare Officer for the National Union of Students as a member of the Australian Labor Students, and in 2001 became an electorate officer for federal Labor MP Lindsay Tanner, transferring to Senator Gavin Marshall in 2002. In 2004 he became a state organiser with the Victorian Labor Party, and in 2007 moved to the Plumbing Trades Employees Union as a community organiser, a position he held until his appointment to the Legislative Council in 2010. Murphy was involved in the controversial round of ALP preselections in 2006 in Victoria, where he challenged sitting member and future Speaker of the House Harry Jenkins for the safe Labor Division of Scullin. One journalist wrote that \"the choice of Murphy was so wrong-headed that even some of the Labor Unity people who negotiated the deal were embarrassed by it.\" In the lead up to the 2010 Victorian Election, Murphy held a $500 a head fundraiser at a Melbourne apartment. The event gained media attention when the apartment was subsequently found decrepit and soiled. Murphy lost his Legislative Council position at the election."

  "text" : "Nicholas Barnewall, 3rd Viscount Barnewall (15 April 1668 – 14 June 1725) was an Irish nobleman. His grandfather, also named Nicholas Barnewall, had been ennobled by King Charles I on 12 September 1645 for loyalty to his cause. Nicholas was the eldest son of Henry, 2nd Viscount Barnewall, by Lady Mary Nugent, daughter of Richard Nugent, 2nd Earl of Westmeath. Before Nicholas was of age he married Mary Hamilton, daughter of George, Count Hamilton (son of Sir George Hamilton, 1st Baronet, of Donalong), by his wife, Frances Jennings (afterwards married to the Earl of Tyrconnel). They had three children: Henry, 4th Viscount Barnewall; George, father of the 5th Viscount; and Frances, who married her distant cousin Richard Barnewall and was the mother of the 14th Baron Trimlestown. In 1688 he entered King James's Irish army as captain in the Earl of Limerick's Dragoons. After the defeat of the Boyne he was moved to Limerick; and being in that city at the time of its surrender, was included in the articles and secured his estates. In the first Irish Parliament of William III he took the oath of allegiance, but upon declining to subscribe the declaration according to the English Act of 1689, as contrary to his conscience, he was obliged to withdraw with the other Catholic lords. In February 1703, he joined with many Irish Catholics in an unavailing petition against the infraction of the Treaty of Limerick. Lord Barnewall died 14 June 1725, and was buried at Lusk."

Born in Wallonia, Hyeronimus arrived in New South Wales in about 1840. In 1842, he established the Lion of Waterloo, the first inn at Montefiores, near present-day Wellington, in the central west of New South Wales. He later built the first house in Wellington, and established the Carriers Arms, the first inn at the present site of Dubbo, New South Wales. In about 1854, Hyeronimus built the homestead The Meeting of the Waters (now named Glenrock), on land west of the Bell River near Wellington. By 1859, he was the proprietor of Goonoo (now Goonoo Goonoo), a pastoral run of 30,000 acres (120 km2) in Wellington County, and also three other pastoral runs totalling 61,480 acres (248.8 km2) in Bligh County. On 15 June 1859, Hyeronimus was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the inaugural member for the electoral district of Wellington. However, he died in Sydney in 1860, after serving only just over one year in office."

Nasarudin Hashim (born 20 July 1950) is a Malaysian politician. A member of the Perak State Legislative Assembly, he is known for his key role in the constitutional crisis in the state in 2009. His defection from the People's Justice Party (PKR) to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)—days after he had defected the other way—helped cause the collapse of the Pakatan Rakyat government of which PKR was a component party. Nasarudin was first elected to the assembly in 2004, as an UMNO member representing the seat of Parit. He was re-elected to the assembly in 2008, albeit for a different seat, Bota. In the 2008 election, the Pakatan Rakyat coalition took power in Perak, consigning Nasarudin's UMNO to opposition for the first time in the state's history. On 25 January 2009, Nasarudin announced his defection to PKR, thus boosting the Pakatan Rakyat's narrow majority in the assembly. He claimed it was a \"brave\" decision that had the support of his constituents. His move was followed by the defection of eight UMNO branches in his constituency. However, in early February, Nasarudin defected back to UMNO. Joined by three other Pakatan Rakyat MPs, the defection gave the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional coalition the numbers to return to government. Nasarudin said his reversal was to ensure the \"stability\" of government in Perak."

Whitney was born in Prince Edward County, Ontario, the son of David Henry Whitney and Ida May Wycott. Originally elected in the general election in 1951, he was re-elected in the general elections in 1955, 1959, 1963 and 1967, becoming the longest-serving MPP in that riding. During his four terms in office, Whitney was never appointed to Cabinet, but did sit on an average of ten Standing Committees during each term. Prior to being elected, Whitney was a sheep farmer in Prince Edward County. In 1980, Whitney died in a fire which destroyed his farm operation. In 1982, a new arch bridge constructed to connect the east end of Prince Edward County to Belleville (provincial Highway 62) was named the Norris Whitney Bridge, in tribute to his lengthy public service. Whitney is buried at the Albury Church Cemetery, Prince Edward County, Ontario."

  "text" : "Nancie Peacocke Fadeley (born July 11, 1930) is a former member of the Oregon House of Representatives, representing portions of Springfield and Eugene, in Lane County, Oregon, United States, from 1971 to January 1981. Elected in November 1970, she first took office in January 1971, holding one of five seats (Position 1) in House District 13 (mostly in Lane County). With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate. The mother of two children, Fadeley is now a freelance journalist who writes about Oregon history, environmental issues, and concerns of older women."

She is a member of the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. During the 2014 War in Donbass, Savchenko, a first lieutenant in the Ukrainian Ground Forces, served as instructor with a volunteer infantry unit, Aidar Battalion. In June, 2014 she was captured by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and handed over to Russia, where she was accused of having directed artillery fire that killed two Russian state-television journalists at the positions of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine. She was subsequently charged and convicted of murder and illegally crossing Russian state border despite being abducted from Ukrainian territory one hour before the deaths of the journalists. One of her lawyers, Mark Feygin, says she is a prisoner-of-war and has called on the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to demand her immediate release and that of the other Ukrainian POWs lest Russia be held in violation of the Geneva Conventions. European Union ministers and their representative regard her detention as illegal and that her trial does not respect basic human rights, including the right to fair proceedings. In November 2014, while still imprisoned, Savchenko was elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, and she formally resigned from her military post. On 25 May 2016, Savchencko was exchanged in a prisoner swap for Russian GRU officers Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Alexandrov captured by Ukraine. Savchenko was one of Ukraine's first women to train as a military airplane pilot, and is the only female aviator to pilot the Sukhoi Su-24 bomber and the Mil Mi-24 helicopter."
