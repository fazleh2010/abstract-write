  "text" : "Aneurin Bevan (pronunciation: /əˈnaɪrɪn/; Welsh: [aˈnəɨ.rin]; 15 November 1897 – 6 July 1960), often known as Nye Bevan, was a Welsh Labour Party politician who was the Minister for Health in the post-war Attlee government from 1945 to 1951. The son of a coal miner, Bevan was a lifelong champion of social justice, rights of working people, and democratic socialism. He was a long-time Member of Parliament (MP), representing Ebbw Vale in South Wales for 31 years. He was one of the chief spokesmen for the Labour Party's left wing, and of left-wing British thought generally. His most famous accomplishment came when, as Minister of Health, he spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service, which was to provide medical care free at point-of-need to all Britons. He resigned when the Attlee government decided to transfer funds from the National Insurance Fund to pay for rearmament. He subsequently became the leader of the left-wing group within the party, which came to be known as \"Bevanite\". Bevan remains one of Wales's most revered politicians. In 2004, over 40 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the welfare state."

  "text" : "Alfred Deakin (3 August 1856 – 7 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. It is likely that he could have been Premier of Victoria, but he chose to devote his energy to federation. Throughout the 1890s Deakin was a participant in conferences of representatives of the Australian colonies that were established to draft a constitution for the proposed federation. He played an important role in ensuring that the draft was liberal and democratic and in achieving compromises to enable its eventual success. Between conferences, he worked to popularise the concept of federation and campaigned for its acceptance in colonial referenda. He then fought hard to ensure acceptance of the proposed constitution by the Government of the United Kingdom. As Prime Minister, Deakin completed a significant legislative program that makes him, with Labor's Andrew Fisher, the founder of an effective Commonwealth government. He expanded the High Court, provided major funding for the purchase of ships, leading to the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy as a significant force under the Fisher government, and established Australian control of Papua. Confronted by the rising Australian Labor Party in 1909, he merged his Protectionist Party with Joseph Cook's Anti-Socialist Party to create the Commonwealth Liberal Party (known commonly as the Fusion), the main ancestor of the modern Liberal Party of Australia. The Deakin-led Liberal Party government lost to Fisher Labor at the 1910 election, which saw the first time a federal political party had been elected with a majority in either house in Federal Parliament. Deakin resigned from Parliament prior to the 1913 election, with Joseph Cook winning the Liberal Party leadership ballot."

As Foreign Secretary, he negotiated the Locarno Pact (1925), aimed at preventing war between France and Germany, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He was one of the few MPs supporting Winston Churchill's appeals for rearmament against the German threat in the 1930s."

  "text" : "Arthur Henderson PC (13 September 1863 – 20 October 1935) was a British iron moulder and Labour politician. He was the first Labour cabinet minister, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934 and, uniquely, served three separate terms as Leader of the Labour Party in three different decades. He was popular among his colleagues, who called him \"Uncle Arthur\" in acknowledgement of his integrity, his devotion to the cause and his imperturbability. He was a transitional figure whose policies were, at first, close to those of the Liberal Party, and the trades unions rejected his emphasis on arbitration and conciliation, and thwarted his goal of unifying the Labour Party and the trades unions."

  "text" : "Alton Brooks Parker (May 14, 1852 – May 10, 1926) was an American judge, best known as the Conservative Democrat who lost the presidential election of 1904 to incumbent Theodore Roosevelt in a landslide. A native of upstate New York, Parker practiced law in Kingston, New York, before being appointed to the New York Supreme Court and elected to the New York Court of Appeals; he served as Chief Judge of the latter from 1898 to 1904, when he resigned to run for president. In 1904, he defeated liberal publisher William Randolph Hearst for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. In the general election, Parker opposed popular incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. After a disorganized and ineffective campaign, Parker was defeated by 336 electoral votes to 140, carrying only the traditionally Democratic Solid South. He then returned to practicing law. He managed John A. Dix's successful 1910 campaign for Governor of New York and served as prosecution counsel for the 1913 impeachment of Dix's successor, Governor William Sulzer."

  "text" : "Alan Kenneth Mackenzie Clark PC (13 April 1928 – 5 September 1999) was a British Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), historian and diarist. He served as a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher's governments at the Departments of Employment, Trade and Defence, and became a privy counsellor in 1991. He was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work The Donkeys (1961), which is considered to have inspired the musical satire Oh, What a Lovely War! Clark became known for his flamboyance, wit and irreverence. Norman Lamont called him \"the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times\". He is particularly remembered for his three-volume diary, a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a moving description of the weeks preceding his death, when he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page. Clark was a passionate supporter of animal rights, joining activists in demonstrations at Dover against live export, and outside the House of Commons in support of Animal Liberation Front hunger-striker Barry Horne. When he died after radiation therapy for a brain tumour, his family said Clark wanted it to be stated that he had \"gone to join Tom and the other dogs.\""

  "text" : "Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan (Russian: Анаста́с Ива́нович Микоя́н; Armenian: Անաստաս Հովհաննեսի Միկոյան Anastas Hovhannesi Mikoyan; English pronunciation: /miːkoʊˈjɑːn/; 25 November [O.S. 13 November] 1895 – 21 October 1978) was an Old Bolshevik and Soviet statesman during the mandates of Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev. He was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as that power oscillated between the Central Committee and the Politburo, from the latter days of Lenin's rule, throughout the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, until his peaceful retirement after the first months of Brezhnev's rule. Mikoyan became an early convert to the Bolshevik cause. Mikoyan was a strong supporter of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of Foreign Trade. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him. In 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of foreign trade minister. At the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policy, and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time. Mikoyan made several key trips to communist Cuba and to the United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965. He is also known for having introduced ice cream, hamburgers, and hot dogs to the USSR."

He is recognized as the leading architect of independence, and the founder of the Union of Burma. Affectionately known as \"Bogyoke\" (Major General), Aung San is still widely admired by the Burmese people, and his name is still invoked in Burmese politics to this day. Aung San's daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, is a Burmese stateswoman and politician and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize who is now serving as State Counsellor and 20th and First Female Minister of Foreign Affairs in Htin Kyaw's Cabinet."

  "text" : "Andrew Rainsford Wetmore (August 16, 1820 – March 7, 1892) was a New Brunswick politician, jurist, and a member of a prominent United Empire Loyalist family. Wetmore entered politics in 1865 with his election to the colonial legislature as an Anti-Confederate. His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands. On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court."

  "text" : "(For other people with the same name, see Andrew Cunningham (disambiguation).) Andrew 'Andy' Cunningham (8 June 1910 – 14 June 2010) was a political figure and union leader in North East England. Born in Durham, he was jailed for his role in the Poulson scandal of 1974. He lived most of his life in Chester-le-Street. At the height of his career in 1971 he held the following positions: \n* Member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party \n* Chairman of the Chester-le-Street and the Northern Region Executive of the Labour Party \n* Head of the Northern District of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW) (the biggest union in the north-east, succeeding John Yarwood MBE) \n* Alderman of Durham County Council \n* Member of the Chester-le-Street town council \n* Chairman of Durham Police Authority \n* Chairman of Newcastle Airport Consultative Committee \n* Member of the Northumbrian River Authority \n* Member of the Peterlee New Town Development Corporation \n* Member of the Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority His role with the GMWU in particular gave him considerable influence, via the Trade Union block vote, in the selection of Labour Party parliamentary candidates. The Poulson scandal also destroyed the careers of T. Dan Smith and the Conservative Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling. Cunningham was sentenced to five years imprisonment, reduced to three on appeal. He was paroled from Ford Open Prison in June 1976. He was the father of Labour politician Jack Cunningham and two other children."

  "text" : "Andrew Damien Wilkie (born 8 November 1961, Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian politician and independent federal member for Denison. He has been an army officer and an intelligence analyst. In 2003 Wilkie resigned from his position in Australia's Office of National Assessments intelligence agency in the lead up to the Iraq War, because he said he feared the humanitarian consequences of invasion such as Saddam using his Weapons of Mass Destruction, or assisting terrorists. Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences. Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at the 2013 federal election and increased his margin."

Although largely powerless, as the government was effectively controlled by King George II, he still bore the burden of the German invasion which commenced on April 6 of the same year. Less than two weeks later, on April 18, as German troops marched towards Athens and the city was placed under martial law, he committed suicide by shooting himself. The cause of his death was initially reported to be a heart attack, probably to avoid causing mass panic in Athens. He was originally from the small island of Poros in Greece, where a museum dedicated to his life and contribution exists today."

In 1844, Sherman ran for mayor of Chicago after an initial election was election invalidated based on charges of \"illegal proceedings and fraud.\". He ran as an Independent Democratic nominee against incumbent Democrat Augustus Garrett and Liberty Party nominee Henry Smith, winning the office with just over 50% of the vote. As mayor, he oversaw the city's purchase of its first piece of fire-fighting equipment and appointed Denis Swenie as fire chief. In 1850, he became one of the original trustees of Northwestern University. He moved to Waukegan, Illinois in 1856. In the 1870s, when a canal being dug in Lemont, Illinois revealed Athens marble, Sherman was instrumental in developing the marble quarry there. He died in 1903 and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Waukegan, Illinois."

  "text" : "Augustus Garrett (1801 – November 30, 1848) twice served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1843–1844, 1845–1846) for the Democratic Party. Garrett married Eliza Clark in 1825 and moved to Chicago from New York in 1834. He had a small auction house near the Chicago River and by the following year had formed a partnership with the Brown Brothers, which allowed him to become a leading land speculator and auctioneer. By October 1836, he had sales of more than $1.8 million. Elected mayor in 1843, he won re-election in 1844 only to have the election invalidated based on charges of \"illegal proceedings and fraud.\" Garrett ran in a second election that year, losing to Alson Sherman. During his terms in office, Garrett pushed to have the first brick school in Chicago, Dearborn School, turned into either a warehouse or an insane asylum, believing that the building was too large for use as a school. Following his death, Eliza established the Garrett Bible Institute, now Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, in nearby Evanston, Illinois."

  "text" : "Arthur Sewall (November 25, 1835 – September 5, 1900) was a U.S. Democratic politician from Maine most notable as William Jennings Bryan's first running mate in 1896. As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Arthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900. Sewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican."

  "text" : "Alfred Rosmer (1877–1964) was a syndicalist leader before World War I and one of the few leaders of that movement to oppose the war from a revolutionary internationalist position. A friendship with Leon Trotsky dated from that period, when the latter was living in France. After the war he became a leading figure in the Communist Party of France before being ousted as early as 1924, along with Boris Souvarine and Pierre Monatte, for opposing Stalinism and the elimination of the Old Bolsheviks, as that party underwent so called \"Bolshevisation\". He then became a leader of the early Trotskyist movement only to drop out of politics in 1932. Nevertheless he remained a convinced revolutionary and his friendship with Trotsky was later repaired. The founding congress of the Trotskyist Fourth International was held at his home outside Paris. Rosmer was a member of the Dewey Commission which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials."

  "text" : "Abraham Theodor Berge (20 August 1851 – 10 July 1936) was Prime Minister of Norway from 1923 to 1924. He was a teacher and civil servant who represented Venstre, the social liberal party, and later Frisinnede Venstre, a right-of-centre party. Berge was born at Lyngdal in Lister og Mandals amt (present-day Vest-Agder, Norway). He was the son of Johan Tobias Johnsen Berge (1813-1883) and Helene Andreasdatter Kvalsvig. A teacher by profession, Berge started his political career in Lista in the present-day municipality of Farsund, where he was in 1882 elected mayor. From here he went on to the Norwegian Parliament in 1891. He served, in different periods, as both Minister of Culture and Church Affairs and Minister of Finance. Then, after a 10-year absence from politics, he became again Minister of Finance, and later also Prime Minister, when sitting Prime Minister Otto Bahr Halvorsen died. He resigned this post as the result of the defeat in a vote to lift prohibition. In 1926 he was, as the only Norwegian Prime Minister ever, impeached. The charge was withholding information relating to the government rescue of a bank threatened by bankruptcy. He was, however, acquitted in 1927, along with the six ministers who stood trial alongside him."

  "text" : "Paul Ludwig Adalbert Falk (10 August 1827 – July 7, 1900) was a German politician. Falk was born at Metschkau (Mieczków), Silesia. In 184,7 he entered the Prussian state service and, in 1853, became public prosecutor at Lyck (now Ełk). In 1858, he was elected a deputy, joining the Old Liberal party. In 1868, he became a privy councillor in the ministry of justice. In 1872, he was made minister of education, and, in connection with Otto von Bismarck's policy of the Kulturkampf, he was responsible for the May Laws or Falk Laws against the Roman Catholic Church. In 1879, his position becoming untenable because of the death of Pope Pius IX and the change of German policy with regard to the Vatican, he resigned his office but retained his seat in the Reichstag until 1882. He was then made president of the supreme court of justice at Hamm, where he died in 1900."

  "text" : "Anne Johnston (born 1932) is a Canadian politician and executive. She was a longtime city councillor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1972, and served until 1985 when she ran against incumbent Mayor Art Eggleton, but was defeated. In 1988 she was elected to Metro Toronto Council (in the first election where Metro Councillors were directly elected). She served until Toronto was amalgamated into the megacity in 1997. That year, she was elected to the new Toronto City Council and served until 2003, when she was defeated by Karen Stintz. At the time of her defeat, she was the longest-serving and the oldest member of Toronto council. Johnston was also a candidate for Mayor of Toronto in 1978, when she lost to Fred Beavis in a deadlocked council vote for David Crombie's interim replacement; that vote literally came down to Beavis' name being drawn out of a hat. She campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party, and lost to Progressive Conservative incumbent Larry Grossman in St. Andrew—St. Patrick by 3,835 votes. Johnston attempted to unseat Art Eggleton as mayor in the 1985 municipal election but was defeated 92,994 votes to 59,817. She returned to elected office in the 1988 when she was acclaimed as Metro Councillor for North Toronto. For most of her career, Johnston was known as a progressive voice on council. In her final term she supported a controversial condominium development at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton in 2002 adjacent to her ward. The North Toronto Tenants Network was so incensed by Johnston's move that they ran an advertisement in a local community paper, seeking applicants to contest Johnston's council seat. Stintz responded, and defeated Johnston in the 2003 municipal election by 2,321 votes. Johnston chaired the Toronto Seniors' Assembly and has been appointed as the group's Seniors' Advocate. The Anne Johnston Health Station in Toronto is named after her."

  "text" : "Adam Giambrone (born March 8, 1977) is a Canadian politician who was a Toronto City Councillor, representing the southern of two Davenport wards. Elected at 26, he remained the youngest member of Toronto council after re-election. He was president of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) from 2001 to 2005. He was the 2008 recipient of Now Magazine's \"Best City Politician\" award. He graduated from McGill University with a bachelor's degree in archaeology, and has participated in excavations in Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, and Guatemala. He speaks English, French, and Arabic fluently. He is of Italian-American ancestry; his father moved to Canada to avoid the Vietnam War. As Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission, Giambrone oversaw the largest expansion of bus service in Toronto. Giambrone secured over $8 billion in new funding to build light rail into areas of the city currently not served by rapid transit. An expansion of two subway lines also forms part of an overall $18 billion long-term expansion plan driven by Giambrone. On February 1, 2010, Giambrone announced his candidacy to succeed David Miller as Mayor of Toronto in the 2010 election, as a leading progressive candidate, showing second place in polls after John Tory dropped out, though Giambrone also had a high \"unfavourable\" rating of 40%. Giambrone exited the mayoral race on February 10, 2010 amidst a sex scandal and he did not run for re-election for his council seat. Giambrone was the Ontario NDP's candidate for the August 1, 2013 provincial by-election in Scarborough—Guildwood. He placed third with 28% of the vote."

Here he became a partner in a land, insurance and auctioning company, and was the publisher of the Calgary Herald. In 1891, he spent one one-year term as a town councilor. This was followed by two one-year terms as the mayor of Calgary. As Calgary's seventh mayor, he helped found the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber has a room named in his honour.

He narrowly won his mayoral election against incumbent Wesley Fletcher Orr. After his term, McBride did not seek re-election. This allowed Orr to return uncontested to the mayoral seat. Prior to moving to Calgary, McBride was a tinsmith in London, Ontario. There, he and his wife, Lucy, built in 1874 the home located at 504 Colborne Street. Lucy's asthma was the motivating factor for their move to Calgary. Early in the 1900s, he left Calgary and spent time in Fort Steele, British Columbia, Cranbrook, British Columbia, and Red Deer, Alberta. Edward, the oldest of his six children, took over his business. McBride died in Galt, Ontario in 1912."

  "text" : "Adela Constantia Mary Pankhurst Walsh (19 June 1885 – 23 May 1961) was a British-Australian suffragette, political organiser, and co-founder of both the Communist Party of Australia and the Australia First Movement. Adela was born on 19 June 1885 in Manchester, England, into a politicised family: her father, Richard Pankhurst was a socialist and candidate for Parliament, and her mother Emmeline Pankhurst and sisters Sylvia and Christabel were leaders of the British suffragette movement. Her mother was of Manx descent. Adela attended the all-woman Studley Horticultural College in Warwickshire, and Manchester High School for Girls. As a teenager, Adela became involved in the militant Women's Social and Political Union founded by her mother and sisters. Following estrangement from her family, Adela emigrated to Australia in 1914. She was recruited during World War I as an organiser for the Women's Peace Army in Melbourne by Vida Goldstein. Pankhurst wrote a book called Put Up the Sword, penned a number of anti-war pamphlets and addressed public meetings on her opposition to the war and conscription. In August 1917, Pankhurst was arrested during a march against rising food prices in Melbourne, which had been part of a series of sometimes violent demonstrations, unusual for the time in that they were spearheaded by women. In September 1917, she married Tom Walsh of the Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia, with whom she had a son and five daughters. In 1920, Pankhurst became a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia, from which she was later expelled. She became disillusioned with communism and founded the anti-communist Australian Women's Guild of Empire in 1927. In 1941 Adela became one of the founding members of the right wing and nationalistic Australia First Movement. She visited Japan in 1939 and was arrested and interned in 1942 for her advocacy of peace with Japan."

  "text" : "Alexander McNair (May 5, 1775 – March 18, 1826) was an American frontiersman and politician. He was the first Governor of Missouri from its entry as a state in 1820, until 1824. McNair was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and grew up in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania. His grandfather, David McNair, Sr., immigrated to Pennsylvania from Donaghmore, County Donegal, Ireland around 1733 and had Scottish ancestors from Loch Lomond. David McNair, Jr., Alexander's father (b. 1736), fought with General George Washington in the Trenton and Princeton campaigns in the winter of 1776–77, and died in February, 1777 as a result of wounds received in battle and exposure when Alexander was less than two years old. Alexander went to school as a child, and attended one term at the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania). He reached an agreement with his mother and brothers that the brothers would have a boxing match and that the winner would receive the father's property. Alexander was defeated. He became a member of the Pennsylvania militia and fought for the government in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1791 and 1794. In 1804, McNair traveled to what is now Missouri, the United States having just acquired it following the Louisiana Purchase. In that year he married Marguerite Suzanne de Reihle de Regal, the daughter of a French marquis. He lived in St. Louis, Missouri, participated in Freemasonry as a member of St. Louis Lodge 111, and served as a United States Marshal. He also became a successful businessman, and served two terms on the Board of Trustees of the Town of St. Louis, in 1808 and 1813. On May 24, 1813, Stephen F. Austin, who was later responsible for the colonization of Texas, and for whom Austin, Texas is named, was commissioned an ensign in the Missouri militia. Later in September, he enlisted as a private in the First Regiment of Mounted Militia commanded by Colonel Alexander McNair. McNair was elected governor in 1820, receiving 72% of the vote and defeating the famous explorer William Clark. After his time as governor, he worked in the Indian Department until his death. He died of influenza, and is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis."

  "text" : "Alexander Turk (March 5, 1906 – January 1, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958. Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, the son of Nathaniel Turk and Mary O'Lynn, Turk came to Canada with his family in 1910, and was educated at Lord Selkirk School. In 1931, he married Annie Owens. He was a wrestling promoter and president of the Giants Baseball Club, and was known in politics as a charismatic showman. Some credit him with introducing modern professional wrestling to Manitoba in 1946 with his company, the NWA-affiliated Alex Turk Promotions. In later years, he would promote Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Bruno Sammartino, Haystacks Calhoun, Lou Thesz and others in the region. He was eventually pushed out of business by competition from the American Wrestling Association. Turk's election to the Manitoba legislature was somewhat unexpected. In the 1953 election, he ran as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party in Winnipeg North, a constituency dominated by the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour Progressive Party. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates on the multi-member constituency's first count, behind two other Liberal-Progressive candidates. He did well on transfers, however, and defeated fellow Liberal-Progressive J.M. Kozoriz for the final position. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government. Turk was on the left-wing of the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1954, he was the only member of the government caucus to support a CCF bill calling for comprehensive health insurance. The following year, he was the only Liberal-Progressive MLA to endorse a bill calling for progressive prison reforms. Winnipeg's multi-member constituencies were eliminated in the 1958 election, and Turk lost to Steve Peters of the CCF by 856 votes in the newly created riding of Elmwood. He ran again in the 1959 election, but finished third. After leaving provincial politics, Turk was elected to the Winnipeg City Council. Though a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee, he again showed himself to be a progressive representative on issues relating to workers, pensioners and the handicapped, and often voted with the CCF group. In 1964, he lost his seat on council to another CEC candidate."

Having previously been chairman of his local Young Conservatives, Reed Herbert became disillusioned with the Tories in 1972 when a Party Conference motion sponsored by Enoch Powell, condemning the government for admitting Ugandan Asian refugees, was defeated. He subsequently joined the NF and swiftly rose to the leadership. To counter accusations from the 'populist' faction of the NF that the leadership was too right wing, in June 1974 he was co-opted onto the NF's Directorate; not being tainted with a fascist past like so many of the NF leaders, he was acceptable as a moderate in the populists' eyes. As a consequence, it was Reed Herbert who cast the deciding vote which unseated John Tyndall as leader and gave the leadership to John Kingsley Read in 1974. Although he thus became associated with the populist wing of the party, he stopped short of joining the National Party when Tyndall regained control and the populists left, instead remaining within the NF. This is not to say that his views are moderate in the wider sense. He is quoted as saying: The immigrants and the British are racially and genetically incompatible, which is why immigrants must be repatriated. I wish them all the luck in the world, but not here.... I experience tension whenever I see a group of Indians walking down the street. I feel they are alien, a threatening presence. He contested the Leicester East constituency for the NF in the October 1974 general election, polling 2967 votes (6%). He also stood as NF candidate in the by-election for the Birmingham Ladywood constituency on 18 August 1977, polling 888 votes (5.7%) and forcing the Liberal candidate into fourth place. In 1979, Reed Herbert broke with the NF to lead his own British Democratic Party. He went on to merge the party into the newly formed British National Party in 1982."

He became a Queen's Counsel in 1897. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland from December 1905to 1909, and as Lord Advocate from February 1909 to 1913. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Lloyd George's 1909–10 budget. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1909. In 1909, he conducted the prosecution of Oscar Slater for murder; the conviction was later quashed on appeal. He lived in a huge Georgian townhouse, 31 Heriot Row, in Edinburgh's Second New Town. On leaving Parliament he was raised to the bench as Lord Strathclyde and appointed Lord Justice General, a post he held until 1920. He was raised to the Peerage as Baron Strathclyde, of Sandyford in the County of Lanark, in 1914. In 1917, he was appointed to the Order of the British Empire as a Knight Grand Cross. He is said to have been skilled in cross-examination, and was more suited to life as an advocate than as a judge. The peerage became extinct on his death."

  "text" : "Alfred Edward Waterson (5 August 1880, Derby – 25 November 1964) was a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He was the first Co-operative Party MP. Born in Derby, Waterson was a railwayman and activist in his trade union. He served as a town councillor. Although the Co-operative Party put up several candidates for the first time at the 1918 general election, only one met with success. Waterson was elected as MP for the Kettering seat. He took the Labour whip in Parliament, ahead of any decision of Co-operative Congress to progress a formal alliance with the Labour Party. Waterson was defeated at the 1922 general election. He became a national organiser of the Co-operative Party, serving until 1945. He contested the Nottingham Central by-election in 1930, and stood in Nottingham Central at the 1931 general election, coming a distant second in each case. He died in Wood Green, London aged 84."

  "text" : "Allen Jones (December 24, 1739 – November 10, 1798) was an American planter and statesman from Northampton County, North Carolina. Allen Jones was born in Bertie County (later Halifax County), in colonial North Carolina. He attended Eton College in England. After returning to the colony, he was a member of the colonial assembly between 1773 and 1775 and delegate to the five North Carolina Provincial Congresses (1774-1776), serving as vice-president in the Fourth Provincial Congress. Jones served in the military throughout the American Revolutionary War (1775–81), attaining the rank of brigadier general. He also served in the State senate 1777 to 1779, 1783, 1784, and 1787; and as a Member of the Continental Congress in 1779 and 1780. Jones was a delegate at the state convention that rejected the proposed Constitution of the United States at Halifax, in 1788. Allen Jones died on his plantation, Mount Gallant, near Roanoke Rapids, Northampton County, N.C., on November 10, 1798. Interment was in the private burial ground on his estate. Allen was the slightly older brother of Congressman Willie (pronounced Wylie) Jones, a leader in neighboring Halifax County. Together they were the source of the Jones surname adopted by the Scottish American naval hero during the Revolutionary War, John Paul Jones — whose birth-surname was Paul. Allen Jones was also the father-in-law of North Carolina Governor and Constitutional Convention delegate William Richardson Davie."

  "text" : "Andrew Scott \"Andy\" Haydon (born 1933 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian engineer and politician. He was reeve of Nepean Township, Ontario from 1970 to 1978 and Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton from 1978-1991. Haydon was the first mayor of the city of Nepean when it incorporated on November 24, 1978; Ben Franklin assumed the title one week later. Born in Toronto, Haydon came to Ottawa when he was six. He attended Queen's University where he received a degree in chemical engineering. He then worked in Cornwall, Ontario as a professional engineer. He moved to Nepean Township in 1961 and in 1966 he was elected to Township council, after it was expanded to five aldermen from three. In 1969, he was elected reeve of Nepean. He defeated the incumbent reeve D. Aubrey Moodie in a landslide with 66% of the vote, thanks to the new subdivisions in the city unhappy with Moodie's tax increase. The Nepean Sportsplex and National Capital Equestrian Park were built during Haydon's term as reeve. In 1978 he became the regional chair of Ottawa-Carleton, where he served for 13 years, helping to introduce Ottawa's Transitway, Ottawa City Hall (then the Regional Offices), and the Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre. He failed however in his plans to establish a second Greenbelt in the city as well as his dreams of establishing Ottawa as a federal capital district. After retiring from politics, he ran a bed and breakfast with his wife. Andrew Haydon Park on the Ottawa River and Andrew Haydon Hall, the city council chambers at Ottawa City Hall, were named after him. Carleton University offers a scholarship in his name each year to a student in an engineering program. In September 2006, Haydon unexpectedly announced his candidacy in the new suburban ward of Gloucester-South Nepean, 15 years after his retirement from politics. He was defeated by Steve Desroches in the 2006 municipal elections. In September 2010, Haydon announced his candidacy for Mayor of Ottawa. He joins 19 other candidates for mayor in the Ottawa municipal election. Haydon has four children with his deceased wife, Mary Leishman. He is currently married to Sherry Franklin, the widow of Ben Franklin, Haydon's successor as mayor of Nepean."

He was a member of the British political party Veritas and was listed on the database of the Electoral Commission as official leader for three days, before the real leader was revealed as Robert Kilroy-Silk. In 2006, he began a private prosecution against Michael Barrymore for alleged drugs and drink offences committed on the night Stuart Lubbock was found dead at the entertainer's home. Bennett co-wrote a book with Terry Lubbock, the father of Stuart Lubbock, Not Awight: Getting Away With Murder, explaining their theory that Stuart Lubbock died as a result of a violent attack on him which Barrymore and his associates that night covered up. He has also campaigned against the parents of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared while on a family holiday in Portugal in 2007. He asserted that they should have been prosecuted for child neglect and accused them of covering up what happened to their daughter, a charge which ultimately led to the family successfully pursuing legal action against him."

  "text" : "Agnes Robertson Robertson (31 July 1882 – 29 January 1968) was an Australian politician. She was a Senator for Western Australia from 1950 to 1962, representing the Liberal Party (1950-1955) and Country Party (1955-1962). She was elected at the 1949 federal election, the second Liberal woman to be elected to the Senate. In 1955, Robertson was dropped from the Liberal Senate ticket for that year's election, with opponents citing her age; she was 73 at that election, and would be 79 at the conclusion of that term. She resigned from the Liberal Party, joined their coalition partner the Country Party, and headed their two-member Senate ticket at the election. She was re-elected after a \"vigorous\" campaign, making speeches across rural South Australia and on radio, and ultimately defeating the third Liberal candidate on preferences. She retired at the conclusion of that term in 1962. Robertson is regarded as the first woman to represent the Country (later National) Party in the Parliament of Australia."

In 1982 he founded and led the Conservative Party of South Africa whose successes among the white electorate made him Leader of the Opposition in 1987, a position he retained until his death. He was born in Piketberg (Cape Province) and began his working life as a journalist, being editor of Die Kerkbode and Hoofstad. He was a keen sportsman, excelling on the rugby field, playing provincial rugby against the All Blacks in 1949. After obtaining his MA in Theology at the University of Stellenbosch, he completed a Doctorate in Political Philosophy at the University of Cape Town. He subsequently entered the Dutch Reformed Church (NG Kerk), serving various congregations as minister for 14 years. He was elected Deputy Chairman of the Cape Synod and later of the General Synod. He married Engela Dreyer on 18 January 1949."

  "text" : "Aksel Larsen (August 5, 1897 – January 10, 1972) was a Danish politician who was chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark and chairman and founder of the Socialist People's Party. Larsen became leader of the Communist Party in 1932, and was elected to the Danish Parliament (Rigsdagen) in 1932. Together with other Danish communists, Larsen had to go into hiding in 1941 when the Danish police began arresting all party members. After the liberation of the Second World War Larsen became a minister in the interim government, and subsequently led his party to its best-ever result in the October 1945 election, in which it took 10% of the vote. The election however, resulted in a Liberal government, and Larsen's party was mostly shunned by the other party leaders. Following the rising in Hungary in 1956, Larsen condemned the Soviet Union's action. This led him into conflict with the members of the party leadership who had a greater loyalty to Moscow; a conflict that ended with his expulsion in November 1958. Larsen's reaction was to establish the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), which, thanks to Larsen's personal popularity, entered parliament at the 1960 election at the expense of the Communists, who from then on played only a very peripheral role in Danish politics. Aksel Larsen -- who was especially in later years highly respected among politicians, even if his party was seen as somewhat irresponsible -- remained as leader of the Socialists until 1968, when he handed over to Sigurd Ømann. He remained an MP until his death in 1972. In 2005, the Danish Institute for International Studies concluded that Larsen held a secret working relationship between 1958 and 1964 with one of Denmark's allied partners in the Cold War, stating that \"Larsen... obviously was an agent of a Western intelligence service.\""

  "text" : "Albert Edgar Solomon (7 March 1876 – 5 October 1914) was an Australian politician. He was Premier of Tasmania from 14 June 1912 to 6 April 1914. Solomon graduated B.A. in 1895 and LL.B. in 1897 at the University of Tasmania, and subsequently qualified for the degrees of M.A. and LL.M. He was admitted to the bar in February 1898. He entered politics as one of the six MHAs for Bass in April 1909, and almost immediately became attorney-general and minister for education in the Elliott Lewis second and third ministries, taking the additional position of minister of mines in October 1909. When Lewis retired in June 1912 Solomon became premier, attorney-general and minister of education, but he had a bare majority of one and it required much tact and finesse to keep the ministry going until April 1914. Attention was given to education and considerable additions were made to the number of state and high schools. Never a robust man, Solomon felt the strain of office – his health broke down, and he died at Hobart aged 38 on 5 October 1914. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a temperance reformer."

  "text" : "Ali Karimli (Azerbaijani: Əli Kərimli) born Ali Amirhuseyn oglu Karimov (Azerbaijani: Əli Əmirhüseyn oğlu Kərimov) (born April 28, 1965) is an Azeri politician and the head of the reformist wing of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP). Karimli was born in the Saatli region of southeastern Azerbaijan. After military service in the Soviet army in 1985, he studied law at the Baku State University. During his studies he established and headed the Yurd (Homeland) movement which supported democratic reforms. In November 1988, Yurd, supported by intellectuals, organized student meetings in Baku to protest the communist regime. Special units of the security services were used to suppress the demonstrations. Like other Azerbaijani nationalists, Karimov changed his name erasing the Russian ending -ov and became Əli Kərimli. In July 1989 Karimli led Yurd into the newly created Popular Front of Azerbaijan (PFA) movement. He headed a party cell at his university and participated in the creation of the movement's charter. In 1991, after receiving his diploma, he started working as a teacher in the Baku State University Law Department. At the same time, Karimli worked as a correspondent with the independent Azadlıq (Freedom) newspaper. In January 1992, he was elected the deputy chairman of the PFA Supreme Council. In April 1993, the head of the PFA and the President of Azerbaijan Abulfaz Elchibey (Azerbaijan's first elected President after the breakup of the Soviet Union) appointed Karimli as Secretary of State. After the coup d'etat in the summer of 1993 which brought Heydər Əliyev to power, Karimli submitted his resignation. In 1995, the PFA was renamed as the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP), with Elchibey remaining as its chairman. From 1995 till 2000 Karimli was Elchibey's first assistant. In the parliamentary elections of 1995 and 2000, he was also elected as a member of parliament. In 2000, after Elchibey's death, the APFP broke up into \"conservative\" and \"reformist\" wings. Karimli became the head of the \"reformists\", which was mostly made up of former activists of the Yurd. Since 2003, Karimli has been calling for creation of a bloc of opposition parties. In spring 2005, under Karimli's initiative, the Freedom (Azadıq) bloc of three parties was created, comprising the APFP-reformists, the Equality Party (Müsavat) and the Democratic party. As another attempt against opposition rights his international passport was confiscated, making Ali Karimli one of the few opposition leaders of the world without a valid international passport. Karimli is active in organizing protests that have rattled Baku since March 2011, part of a regional wave of unrest. He was interrogated for eight hours by the office of Attorney General Zakir Qaralov on 16 April in connection with the protests. In April 2016, after Kerimli criticized the Azerbaijani government over its actions during the 2016 Armenian–Azerbaijani clashes, he became a subject of a series of protests (the latest one held on April 12 in front of Karimli’s house), allegedly organized by the authorities. The protesters also demanded to exile him from the country. According to the human rights lawyer Intigam Aliyev, attacks against Karimli are simply diverting attention from truly important issues and testing technologies to distract people’s justified anger caused by the serious consequences of wrong decisions."

Chair of the Planning and Environment Committee, Roberts was appointed by council as a delegate to the Greater Vancouver Regional District. On council, she spearheaded expansion of child care spaces, advocated that transit money to be spent on buses rather than mega-projects such as RAV (now called the Canada Line), and convinced a majority of city council to deny Wal-Mart's application to build a new store. Roberts also opposed expanded gambling in the city and the 2010 Olympics. Roberts ran for re-election in 2005 placing 19th among 36 candidates with 41,739 votes, thus losing her seat."

  "text" : "Colonel Albert Jennings Fountain (October 23, 1838 – disappeared February 1, 1896) was born on Staten Island, New York, on October 23, 1838, to Solomon Jennings and Catherine de la Fontaine. He was trained as an attorney and elected to the Texas Senate and the New Mexico Legislature. In 1873, Fountain moved from El Paso to Mesilla with his wife Mariana Pérez Fountain and their five children. He served the Union Army in California and Arizona during the American Civil War and later as a militia officer defending against raiding Apaches. Later, however, he developed a long and supportive history with several tribes, many Mescaleros calling him a friend. In Mesilla, he worked as assistant district attorney and probate judge as well as a newspaper editor, founding, in 1877, the Mesilla Valley Independent and the Spanish edition El Independiente del Valle de la Mesilla. He also founded the Mesilla Dramatic Society and the Mesilla Valley Opera House, now The Fountain Theater, both originally operated by his family. Following a purge of corruption among cattle rustlers, Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry disappeared near White Sands, New Mexico, where his wagon, stains of blood, and evidence of an ambush were left. Suspicion centered on two rival landowners, Oliver M. Lee and Albert B. Fall. The bodies were never discovered."

He was Deputy Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on Credit Organizations and Financial Markets, and a member of the LDPR Supreme Council.From 1991 to 1993, he was active as a music manager for Aleksey Afanasiev and the bands Bravo and Mirage. He ran for mayor of Moscow in 1999 and again in 2003, unsuccessfully both times. Mitrofanov served in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union. He holds degrees in international relations from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and from the USA-Canada Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 2005 he made and released a controversial erotic movie titled Yuliya, which portrayed two people called Misha and Yuliya in various sex scenes who resembled then Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko and President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili. He is also known for his strident nationalist comments. For instance in November 2008 he claimed that the economic crisis of 2008 will shut down Ukraine’s industry and that its collapse would make Ukraine a part of the Russian Federation. He left the LDPR in August 2007 to join the A Just Russia party led by Sergei Mironov. Opinion polls at the time suggested that the LDPR would fail to gain representation in the Duma following the election in December 2007, while Fair Russia was expected to gain seats. The LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Mitrofanov's departure would actually improve Mitrofanov's former party's image. Mitrofanov stood as the top candidate for the Fair Russia federal list in Penza at the Russian legislative election, 2007. Ironically, he failed to be re-elected, ending a political career that had lasted since 1993, while the LDPR beat Fair Russia winning a larger share of the national vote. In 2011 he was elected to the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sixth on the list of party A Just Russia from Vologda region. A member of the Just Russia faction. Member of State Duma committee for public associations and religious organizations."

He had also run as a Liberal-Labour candidate in 1948 but was unsuccessful. He was re-elected in the 1955 and 1959 elections and served in the legislature until his death in 1961. He was born in Fort William, Alberta. Wren sat with the Liberal caucus and ran twice in Ontario Liberal Party leadership conventions. He placed second in 1954 with 162 votes when he lost to Farquhar Oliver (a former United Farmers of Ontario MPP). In 1957, Wren and fellow MPP Arthur Reaume were expelled from the Liberal caucus for attacking Oliver's leadership and demanding a new leadership convention. Oliver subsequently resigned and a new leadership vote was held in 1958. Wren ran, placing last with only seven votes on the first ballot and then threw his support to John Wintermeyer who ultimately came from behind to win the convention. Wren served as his party's Labour Critic. He died in office in 1961. Robert Gibson succeeded Wren as the MPP for Kenora and served until his death in 1966."

  "text" : "Albert Gallatin Porter (April 20, 1824 – May 3, 1897) was an American politician who served as the 19th Governor of Indiana from 1881 to 1885 and as a United States Congressman from 1859 to 1863. Originally a Democrat, he joined the Republican Party in 1856 after being expelled by the pro-slavery faction of the Democratic Party. Only the second person born in Indiana to become the state's governor, he reluctantly accepted his party's nomination to run. His term saw the start of Indiana's industrialization that continued for several decades. During the second half of his term a strong Democratic majority took control of the Indiana General Assembly and revoked all of the governor's appointment powers and other authorities, weakening the governors position to its lowest state in the history of the state."

  "text" : "Alick Dudley Kay (3 October 1884 – 4 February 1961) was an Australian politician and Domain orator. He is described by the Australian Dictionary of Biography as a \"harmless ratbag\". Kay was born in the Sydney suburb of Petersham, New South Wales and educated at Petersham and Stanmore public schools. He worked in a wholesale warehouse and in 1913 married Mary Elizabeth Clasby, a 52-year-old widow with five children (one of her sons, John Clasby, was briefly a federal MP). He was given a state funeral. Alick became a clerk with New South Wales Government Railways and joined the army in 1915. Kay ran unsuccessfully for the federal seat of South Sydney for the Nationalist Party in 1917. In 1918 he left the Nationalists and started appearing regularly as an anti-Communist speaker at Sydney Domain. He also travelled regularly to Melbourne to orate next to the Yarra. In 1925, he won one of the five seats of North Shore under proportional representation in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent. In parliament, he regularly voted with Labor to the horror of his former supporters. Under the electoral system, the Australian Labor Party automatically won his position if he resigned, so Jack Lang offered him a position on the Metropolitan Meat Board in 1926 as a consumers' representative. The Thomas Bavin government passed legislation in 1927 to remove him from the board. After Lang's return to power in 1930, he was reappointed to the board, but was sacked again by the Bertram Stevens government. In 1933, Kay travelled to England. His wife had died and he married Dorothy Edith Gamson at Islington in June 1943. He later claimed to have worked for the British Department of Information during World War II. In 1951, he returned to Sydney, and resumed speaking at the Domain on Sundays. He died in the Sydney suburb of Mosman, survived by his wife."

  "text" : "Armando Villanueva Del Campo (25 November 1915 – 14 April 2013) was the leader of the Peruvian American Popular Revolutionary Alliance. Born in Lima, his parents were Pedro Villanueva Urquijo, a gynecologist in the city, and Carmen Rosa Portal del Campo. His only legitimate sibling was his older brother Ing. Pedro Villanueva del Campo Portal. At the age of 15 Villanueva became a member of APRA's Juventud Aprista Peruana in opposition to the military dictatorship of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro. At the age of 18 he was imprisoned in El Frontón prison (located on the small island of San Lorenzo off the coast of Callao, Lima's main port) for his subversive activities in Peru. He was a political ally and personal friend of Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the founder and most prominent leader of the APRA party. Villanueva spent most of his early life in different prisons for his political activities. In 1940, along with other APRA political activists, Villanueva was exiled to Chile. Between the 1940s and 1960s Villanueva would spend his time in between Peruvian prisons and deportations to Chile and Argentina. While living in Santiago he met and married Lucia Ortega. They had a daughter: Lucia del Pilar Villanueva Ortega. In late 1961, before a general amnesty was granted to members of APRA, Villanueva entered Peru clandestinely. He needed to start organizing the multiple party cells in preparation for their return to full political activities. Afraid that he would caught, he sought refuge at his cousin's house in San Isidro. Ana Maria Villanueva de Riva-Vercellotti was married to an Italian, and Armando was convinced that Peru's secret police would never find him there. He was able to stay there, unperturbed, till full amnesty was granted. From 1963 to 1968 Villanueva served as a deputy in the lower house of the Peruvian legislature representing Lima, serving as President of the House of Deputies from 1966 to 1967. Villanueva led the Aprista opposition to the military government of Juan Velasco. The death of Haya de la Torre in 1979 propelled Villanueva to the leadership of the APRA party. As leader of the party Villanueva ran for the Presidency in 1980 resulting in a second place loss to the Popular Action party candidate Fernando Belaúnde. It is said that he lost the elections because the opposition mounted a negative campaign against him, claiming that he was married to a Chilean-born citizen. Chile's victory in the Guerra del Pacifico in 1883, which resulted in Peru losing a large chunk of its southern border to Chile, is still a subject of bad feeling in Peru. In 1985 Villanueva was elected to the Peruvian Senate and given the position of President of the Senate. During the Presidency of Alan García, he served as Prime Minister from 1988 to 1989. In 1990 Villanueva was elected to his last term in the Senate, from 1990 to 1992. Villanueva retired in 2005, at the age of 90, to dedicate the rest of his life to his family and writing. In May 2005, with the death of his cousin Ana Maria, he also assumed the title of family patriarch. He died on 14 April 2013 at the age of 97."

  "text" : "Adriaan van der Stel (-Ceylon, 25 May 1646) was opperhoofd of Mauritius from 1640? to 1645. He was succeeded by Jacob van der Meersch. Adriaan Van Der Stel succeeded Governor Cornelius Gooyer. He landed on the island with seventy men, of whom forty were invalids. The latter thought that they would recover their health. Twenty-three died and the rest returned to Batavia. Van der Stel brought with him various seeds and fruits including sugarcane saplings. He also brought rabbits, sheep, geese, ducks, pigeons and stags. After some years, these animal multiplied and were sources of fresh provisions to passing ships. A mineralogist was sent to the island to make a survey on the island and in 1641 the Company directos sent the ship \"the Petten\" with the orders to Van der Stel that he should cut all ebony trees on the island. To carry out the task, Van der Stel needed more men. He went to Madagascar where he obtained one hundred and five slaves. but within a few weeks, fifty-two ran away and only eighteen were caught. For about three years Van der Stel and his men were able to send six thousand pieces of ebony to Batavia. He also gave great attention to agriculture. Rice, indigo, tobacco and cane cultivation were started. Many fruit trees and vegetables were grown. But in spite of these efforts, their supply of food was not guaranteed. in 1644 a cyclone destroyed the fort and their cultivation. They had to wait for months for a ship from Batavia, and in the meantime they had to go in the woods to search for food. His son Simon would become the first Governor of the Cape of Good Hope."

  "text" : "Abraham Momber a.k.a. Abraham Momber van de Velde was the last commander (opperhoofd) of the Dutch East India Company settlement on Mauritius. He followed Roelof Deodati as the de facto Dutch governor on November 25, 1703. On November 15, 1707 the Company's premises, goods, and administration were almost entirely destroyed by a fire. The same year instructions had been received from the Company to abandon the island. Most Dutch families were transported on two ships to Cape Town, where they arrived on January 26, 1709. After destroying everything they could not take with them, to prevent the abandoned station to be of service to anyone else, Momber and his garrison left on January 25, 1710 to Batavia on the ship Beverwaart. The next colonial governor did not arrive until 1715 with Guillaume Dufresne d' Arsel of the French East India Company."

He was the first Dominican-American elected to public office in the United States, and the first African American to win the Buffalo Mayoral Democratic Primary but was defeated in the following mayoral election. Eve was elected a New York State Assemblyman in 1966 and by the time of his retirement in 2002 had served in the New York State Assembly (143rd District 1967–82, 141st District 1983–2002) longer than any other incumbent member. As Deputy Speaker, he was the highest ranking African American in the New York State Legislature. During his political career he became a political foe of Western New York politician James D. Griffin and of New York State Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. He was a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. At the national level, Eve was once one of three alternates to the 15-person 1984 Democratic Party Platform Committee. Eve was an observer and negotiator during the 1971 Attica Prison riot and the first official to enter the facility to hear the demands of the inmates. An advocate for liberal causes such as economic development, education, job training and development, social services, crime prevention and parole reform, day care and housing, Eve was also a leader in the movement to legislate Harriet Tubman Day as a New York State holiday. He is the father of attorney and former candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York Leecia Eve."

He graduated from the Industrial Geodesy Department at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. He was elected to the Sejm on 25 September 2005, receiving 13 680 votes in 15 Tarnów district as a candidate on the Civic Platform list. He has been the Minister of State Treasury since November 2007. He was also a member of Sejm 2001-2005. Currently he is a head of the PGE PEJ1 (Polish energy company with some links to maybe projected in long future atomic power plant). Because of this and relatively high income(50 000 PLN/month, average from the math average calculation, but not minimal statistical salary in Poland is about 3,403 PLN (1,169 USD)/month), he was nicknamed by one of the newspapers \"BMW (bierny mierny, ale wierny)\" - \"passively mediocre but loyal\". This quotation from the communism Poland times generally means someone, who don't do task in good or average standards, have any ideas but despite this is loyal to the party/organization and this the reason why he/she can get some good paid position, especially created for him. E.g. the plans for Polish atomic energy sources, are not even in basic stage, he is not the physicist or other specialist. Also discussion is in the early stage, because there is no current commercial atomic power plant in Poland, with the strong opposition, which blocked previous attempt."

He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Wigan in a by-election in 1958, following the death of sitting Labour MP Ronald Williams. He was re-elected at the next seven general elections, before stepping down at the 1983 general election, when the seat was held for Labour by Roger Stott. Fitch was one of only two MPs for Wigan in the 20th century to stand down (retire) rather than die in office. His successor Roger Stott reverted to the trend and died in office in 1999. Fitch was a government Assistant Whip from 1964 to 1966, a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from 1966 to 1969 and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 1969 to 1970, and was a member of the nationalised industries select committee.Fitch was also a Member of the European Parliament."

Weed, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces Command Sergeant Major and veteran of the Vietnam War, has a B.A. from Yale University and M.P.A. from Princeton University. After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq."

  "text" : "Andre Haermeyer (born 20 February 1956, in Oberhausen, Germany) is an Australian politician. He was the Australian Labor Party member for Kororoit in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 2002, prior to that representing the Yan Yean electorate in Melbourne's north from 1992. Before being elected to Parliament, Haermeyer worked for the Victorian ALP Head Office and for Senator Robert Ray, a senior federal cabinet minister at the time. Haermeyer's political campaigning skills were much respected after he unexpectedly won the Yan Yean seat in 1992, despite a massive landslide against Labor at that election. He served as Labor's Shadow Police Minister from 1996 and was instrumental in making law and order positive issues for his party, traditionally an area of conservative strength. He forged close ties with the Police Association, which represents police officers and was able to successfully draw attention to the then Kennett government's cutbacks on spending on the Police. In early 1999, he was instrumental in removing then Opposition Leader John Brumby and electing his successor Steve Bracks. When Labor did surprisingly well in the election later that year, it was soon able to form a government and Haermeyer was one of its more senior ministers, in the Police and Emergency Services portfolios. He presided over the hiring over 800 new Police officers. Later he became Victorian Minister for Manufacturing & Export, Minister for Small Business and Minister for Financial Services between 21 January 2005 and 1 December 2006. Haermeyer resigned from parliament on 2 June 2008. A by-election for the seat was held on 28 June"

He was an attorney in Boston, Massachusetts before traveling by land to Oregon; he was a legislator in the Provisional Government of Oregon, mayor of Oregon City, and a general during the Cayuse War that followed the Whitman massacre in 1847. He was also a candidate for Provisional Governor in 1847, before the Oregon Territory was founded, but lost that election. Lovejoy continued his political career during territorial period as a member of both chambers of the Oregon Territorial Legislature; he served as the first Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives in 1849. He was also a delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention held in 1857 that paved the way for Oregon's entry into the Union. He was part owner of the Oregon Telegraph newspaper, and worked on railroad development in the Willamette Valley after leaving politics. Lovejoy Street in Northwest Portland and the Lovejoy Fountain in Downtown Portland are named in his honor."

He was returned as a Liberal MP from the Irish constituency of County Carlow, at a by-election in June 1835. However the election was challenged on petition and he was unseated on 19 August 1835. Raphael succeeded in entering the House of Commons as a Catholic Tory from St Albans in 1847 and retained the seat until his death. Prior to serving in Parliament, he had been Sheriff of London for 1834, where he lost the tip of his left index finger in a fight with a criminal. His father was Edward Raphael who was one of the founders of the Carniac Bank in Madras, India, which opened its doors in 1788. His legacy is the Church of Saint Raphael in Surbiton, London, which he financed and had built as a family chapel. Completed in 1848, only two years before his death, it was later opened to the public as a Roman Catholic church by his nephew, Edward."

She was educated at Normanton Girls' High School and Stockwell Training College. She then worked as a teacher. At the 1945 general election, she was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds North East.

Bacon was a member of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee from 1941 until 1970, and served as the party's chair from 1950 to 1951. In the 1953 Coronation Honours she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. When Labour re-entered government in 1964, she became a Minister of State at the Home Office remaining until 1967, and served under Frank Soskice and Roy Jenkins during a period when liberalising reforms were introduced. From 1967 to 1970, she held the same rank at the Department of Education and Science. After her retirement from the House of Commons, she was created Baroness Bacon, of the City of Leeds and of Normanton in the West Riding of the County of York on 14 October 1970."

Tan Sri Haji Azmi Khalid (born 13 December 1940) is a former member of the Parliament of Malaysia. He represented the constituency of Padang Besar in Perlis. He was also a minister in the federal Cabinet from 1999 to 2008, as a member of the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Azmi's first ministerial appointment was as Minister for Rural Development, becoming the first Cabinet minister from Perlis. He became the Minister for Home Affairs in 2004, before moving to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in 2006. He lost his Cabinet position after the 2008 election for reasons tied to his involvement in political disruption in Perlis. He did not re-contest Padang Besar in the 2013 election. In 2005, Azmi married television personality Normala Shamsuddin. He has four children to his late wife Yasmin Abdullah."

Thompson previously served for six years as the Masten District councilman in the Buffalo Common Council. Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics. Thompson was appointed to the city council in 2001 and was twice re-elected. He was discouraged from pursuing his interest in election to the United States House of Representatives in 2005. He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican."

  "text" : "Brigadier General Aung Gyi (Burmese: အောင်ကြီး [ʔàʊɴ dʑí]; 16 February 1919 – 25 October 2012) was a Burmese politician and a member of General Ne Win's 4th Burma Rifles rising to Brigadier General. He was born to a Burmese Chinese family in Paungde, British Burma in 1919. He played a role in the caretaker government of 1958-60 led by Ne Win. Aung Gyi was number two in the Union Revolutionary Council set up after the 1962 coup, serving as vice-chief of staff and Minister of Trade and Industry until he was forced to resign on 8 February 1963 because of disagreements over economic policy with Ba Nyein and Tin Pe. He was once known as Ne Win's heir apparent. In his memoirs, \"Saturday's Son\", published in 1974, U Nu, then Prime Minister of Myanmar, claimed that his handover of power to the caretaker government was not voluntary but that a group of Army Officers led by Brigadier Aung Gyi and Brigadier Maung Maung threatened him with a \"straight military coup\" should he refuse to handover power to Ne Win. The suggestion that this coup was mainly led by Brigadier Aung Gyi and Maung Maung was supported Col Hla Maw, former commanding officer of 11th Brigade. Aung Gyi's role in suppressing the anti-government student protests in 1962 is not clear. In his resignation speech of 23 July 1988, Ne Win blamed Aung Gyi as \"the real culprit\" in the destruction of the Rangoon University Student Union Building on 8 July 1962. Aung Gyi was ousted in 1963, when he criticized the Council's economic policies, and for statements made in Japan about the cause of the 1962 coup. He was imprisoned in 1965-68, and again in 1973-74. However, Aung Gyi remained loyal to the Tatmadaw (Armed Forces), and his connection with Ne Win remained intact despite his later blunt criticism of the government. Prior to the 8888 Uprising Aung Gyi had written several long open letters, widely distributed throughout the country, to Ne Win, critical of the government, and these became an important supporting factor to opposition movement. On 7 March 1988, Aung Gyi wrote his first letter to Ne Win, suggesting economic reforms and a new cabinet. He strongly criticised the government's Burmese Way to Socialism and warned of possible social unrest. On 9 May 1988 he wrote a second 40-page open letter, reiterating the need for economic reforms. In 1988, he emerged as prominent opposition leader and was imprisoned between 29 July and 25 August 1988. However, he remained a supporter of Ne Win and the army. Just before the army staged its coup on 18 September 1988, he told a crowd that he guaranteed that the army would not stage a coup and the interim government will be formed very soon: \"I will kill myself, [if the army staged a coup]\". After the coup, Aung Gyi told people who came to listen his speech that they \"must not think bad (or 'sin' against) the army even in your minds\". The National League for Democracy was formed on 27 September 1988, with Aung Gyi as Chairman, former General Thura Tin Oo as Vice-Chairman and Aung San Suu Kyi as General Secretary. He resigned on 3 December 1988 from the National League for Democracy (NLD), alleging communist infiltration, to form the Union National Democracy Party (UNDP) on 16 December 1988. Only one candidate from the UNDP was elected in the Myanmar general elections that were held in May 1990. At those elections, there were 485 constituencies. The NLD fielded 447 candidates, and 392 were elected. In 1993 Aung Gyi was sentenced to six months imprisonment for not paying a bill for eggs. In 1998 he visited the United States and recorded an extensive interview with Radio Free Asia. When asked about the army, he said: \"People despise the Tatmadaw. This is a bad sign. The people of Burma have lost faith in the Tatmadaw.\" While he acknowledged the corruption and nepotism of the top junta leaders, he considered that democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was surrounded by communists, the same accusations made by the junta. He blamed the NLD for boycotting the National Convention established to draft a new Constitution. He said, \"I want U Ne Win to contribute something before he dies, because he knows what is right and wrong\". He stated that Ne Win was still influential and had ordered the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to change the name of the government and reshape the Cabinet in 1997. Aung Gyi was among the few who attended the funeral of Ne Win in 2002 who spoke fondly of Ne Win's achievements in helping bring independence to Myanmar in 1948, but he also stated that \"Ne Win betrayed Burma and Ne Win betrayed the country. He committed rape of democracy in Burma by staging a coup. He died an inglorious death. It was a sad and tragic ending\"."

Livingstone was elected to Parliament on his third attempt, at the 1923 general election, when he was returned as Member of Parliament for the Western Isles. He held the seat at the 1924 election, and stood down from Parliament at the 1929 general election. He was the Whip of the 'Radical' Parliamentary Group, formed in opposition to the leadership of David Lloyd George. He declared himself unable to endorse the Liberal Unemployment Pledge, and consequently withdrew in 1929 as Liberal candidate for the Western Isles. He joined the Labour Party in 1930. Livingstone died in Islington, London in September 1950 at the age of 69."

  "text" : "Sir Alfred Billson (18 April 1839 – 9 July 1907) was a Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. Born in Leicester, he was fifth son of William Billson. He was admitted a solicitor in 1860, and moved to Liverpool, where he became partner in the law firm of Oliver Jones, Billson, and Company. He became a J.P. for the city, and was active in local Liberal politics as secretary of South West Lancashire Liberal Association from 1866 to 1884, and of Liverpool's Liberal Association. Billson was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for three different constituencies: from 1892 to 1895 for Barnstaple in Devon, from a by-election in 1897 to the 1900 General Election for Halifax in West Yorkshire, and from the 'Liberal landslide' 1906 General Election, until his death in 1907, for North West Staffordshire, after defeating a Conservative Member. He had also unsuccessfully contested Conservative-held Bradford East in 1896, being defeated by the Honourable Ronald Greville. Billson married in 1862 Lilla, daughter of John Baines of Leicester, and had one son and three daughters. Later in his life he began to live in Shropshire at Rowton Castle as tenant of its then landlord, Baron Rowton, with whom he enjoyed friendship despite political differences, Rowton having been a close Conservative associate of Disraeli. He was an active supporter of Liberal associations in the mainly Conservative-voting county, and served as member of the Atcham Rural District Council and Alberbury Parish Council. In June 1907 he was knighted in King Edward VII's Birthday Honours List although he did not live to receive the accolade. He died suddenly, on 9 July 1907, in the House of Commons when he collapsed in the 'Aye' lobby to cast his vote on sugar duty legislation, aged 68. After cremation at Golders Green Crematorium, his ashes were buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. A future Liberal MP, Congregationalist minister Silvester Horne, officiated. A plaque was placed in his memory in St Michael's Parish Church, Alberbury, near his Rowton Castle home."

  "text" : "Archibald Clark Manuel (1 March 1901 – 10 October 1976) was a Scottish railwayman and politician who was Member of Parliament for Central Ayrshire. Manuel only had an elementary school education, but later in life went to classes through the National Council of Labour. He worked on the railways as an engine driver, and was a member of ASLEF. Originally from Morvern, in Argyll, he lived in Ardrossan where he joined the Labour Party in 1927. He became a member of the Town Council, and was later elected to Ayrshire County Council. He was appointed to the Western Regional Hospital Board and to the Ayrshire Executive Council of the National Health Service. In the 1950 general election Manuel was elected to Parliament for Central Ayrshire. He was re-elected in 1951 but lost the seat in 1955. Persisting despite this rejection, he was re-elected in 1959 when Scotland swung to Labour. A great friend of the Secretary of State for Scotland Willie Ross, Manuel was (like Ross) a ferocious opponent of the Scottish National Party. In an adjournment debate in the Commons in November 1969, Manuel joined in the general attack on the sole SNP MP Winnie Ewing, calling her \"a Tory in disguise\" and \"a parasite\". Manuel retired in 1970. He died in Birkenhead aged 75."

  "text" : "Tun Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib bin Mahmud (born 21 May 1936) is the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak, in office since 2014. Previously he was Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1981 to 2014. Taib was also the President of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), which is part of the Barisan Nasional coalition. He is of ethnic Melanau descent. Taib is informally known as Pak Uban, which translates into \"white-haired uncle\". Among Chinese speaking communities he is known as Pek Moh (白毛) which means \"white hair\". Another informal name for him, in reference to the British Brooke family that ruled Sarawak as White Rajahs in the 19th and early 20th century, is the \"last white rajah\" or \"white-haired rajah\". Holding the post of Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1981 to 2014, he was the longest serving Chief Minister in Malaysia. He assumed the Chief Minister post at the age of 45. Being a member of the Malaysian Parliament for 38 years, Taib is also the second longest-serving parliamentarian in Malaysia after Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Taib and his wider family are regularly accused of corruption and personally benefiting from Sarawak's natural and economic resources. On 12 February 2014, Taib handed over his resignation letter to the Governor of Sarawak to vacate his chief minister post, officially ending his 33 years of chief ministership. His former brother-in-law, Adenan Satem, succeeded him as Chief Minister with effect from 1 March 2014. At the same time, he received the official credentials as the 7th Sarawak Head of State from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at Istana Negara on 28 February, and officially took the oath of office on the following day. He became the second Sarawakian (after his uncle, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub) to be appointed as the Governor after formally relinquishing the post of Chief Minister."

Diomedes was born in Athens, Greece to an Arvanite family from Spetses on January 3, 1875. His grandfather was former Prime Minister Diomidis Kiriakos. He studied law and economics in Weimar and Paris and earned a doctorate from the University of Berlin. In 1905, he became a professor at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He was a member of the Athens Academy. Diomedes was appointed prefect (\"nomarch\") of the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture in 1909. In 1910, he was elected to the Hellenic Parliament under the banner of the Liberal Party. From 1912 to 1915 and again in 1922 he served as Minister for Finance. Diomedes became Governor of the National Bank of Greece in 1923 and Governor of the Bank of Greece in 1928. Diomedes became Prime Minister upon the death of Sophoulis. It was during his brief term in office (June 28, 1949 – January 6, 1950) that the Greek Civil War was concluded. He was forced to resign amid a scandal involving his Minister for Transport, Hatzipanos. He died later in that same year (November 11, 1950). Besides being an economist and politician, Diomedes also authored several literary works, including a two-volume work on Byzantine Empire studies. Along with his wife Julia, Dimides left part of his fortune to the Greek state for the purposes of establishing a botanical garden in Athens, opened in 1952 as the \"Julia and Alexander N. Diomides Botanic Garden\"."

  "text" : "Albert Bellamy (1870 – 26 March 1931) was a British trades unionist and Labour Party politician. Bellamy was born in Wigan, Lancashire and took up employment as an engine-driver for the London and North Western Railway. He became involved in trade union activities, rising to the presidency of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. During the 1911 transport strike, he was prominent in leading the successful campaign for union recognition by the railway companies. When the ASRS was merged with two other rail unions in 1913 to form the National Union of Railwaymen, Bellamy was its first president, serving until 1917. From 1917 to 1927 he was a member of the War Pensions Appeal Tribunal. He made his home at Stockport, Cheshire, where he was president of the local Trades Council and Labour Party, as well serving as a magistrate. He stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party at Wakefield at the 1918 and 1922 general elections. He eventually entered the Commons when he was elected member of parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne at a by-election in October 1928, after the sitting Conservative MP Cornelius Homan was disqualified when he was declared bankrupt. Bellamy was re-elected at the 1929 general election. Following the election, the Second Labour Government was formed, and he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to F O Roberts, Minister of Pensions. Soon after entering government, Bellamy became ill and died, at Wandsworth, in March 1931, aged 60. The by-election for his seat was won by the Conservative candidate John Broadbent."

He won as an independent for the constituency of Yorkton, but was given a position as Minister of Highways within the coalition government led by Tory premier James Thomas Milton Anderson. He served as Minister of Highways until the fall of the government in 1934. In the 1934 election he ran as a Conservative, but lost to the Liberal candidate, Vincent Reynolds Smith. He was re-elected in 1938 under the Unity party, serving until 1944. Stewart was elected as a Liberal to the House of Commons representing the federal riding of Yorkton, serving as a member of the Liberal government led by Louis St. Laurent from 1949 to 1953. He retired from politics due to ill health. Stewart served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I; he was severely injured at Passchendaele. A lawyer by profession, he served as solicitor for the city of Yorkton. He was also president of the Yorkton Board of Trade and Yorkton's first mayor. In 1922, he married Gladys Mae McDougall. He died in Long Beach, California at the age of 64."

Fraser is noted for chasing and grabbing then Minister for Roads, Joe Tripodi, on the floor of the House in September 2005, apparently in relation to a lack of funding for the main roads, including the Pacific Highway in Coffs Harbour. The ABC's coverage of the 2007 election included the caption \"Andrew Fraser the strangler won.\" He later became deputy leader of the NSW Nationals from March 2007 to October 2008. On 3 December 2008, Fraser resigned from the shadow ministry after a physical confrontation with a female colleague, Katrina Hodgkinson."

  "text" : "Brigadier General Ali-Reza Asgari (1 November 1952-2010) was an Iranian general of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, deputy defense minister, and cabinet member of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Asgari had been \"pushed aside\" from his ministerial role after President Ahmadinejad, a former rival, came into power in 2005. Asgari disappeared in Turkey in early 2007, and news reports indicate that he either defected or was kidnapped by Western intelligence agencies. His disappearance has also led to reports that Iran would retaliate by kidnapping American or Israeli officials in Europe. According to The Sunday Times, Asgari was described as a \"gold mine for western intelligence\" by an Israeli defence source who claimed that they had been following him since the 1980s."

Birk was educated at South Hampstead High School and at the London School of Economics. After failing to gain a seat on Salisbury City Council, she gained a seat on Finchley Borough Council and served as leader of the Labour Group between 1950 and 1953. She unsuccessfully stood as a Labour Party candidate to become a Member of Parliament on three occasions; for Ruislip-Northwood in the 1950 general election, and for Portsmouth West in the 1951 and 1955 general elections. In the 1960s she became associate editor of Nova. Birk was created a life peer as Baroness Birk, of Regent's Park in Greater London on 15 September 1967. In her maiden speech she called for an enhanced probation service to help deal with juvenile crime: I would like to see a bigger probation service, better paid, because a probation officer is sometimes the only person with whom the young person can create a stable relationship, which is absolutely essential. In 1969 she was made chairman of the Health Education Council. She served as a Baroness in Waiting between March and October 1974. From 1974 to 1979 she was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of the Environment, and then became Minister of State in the Privy Council Office in 1979. In opposition, she spoke in the House of Lords on the environment between 1979 and 1986, and on arts, libraries, heritage and broadcasting between 1986 and 1993. She was Chairman of Redbridge Jewish Youth Centre between 1970 and 1996 and on the Executive of the Council of Christians and Jews between 1971 and 1977. She was President of the Association of Art Institutions from 1984 to 1996, and President of the Craft Arts Design Association from 1984 to 1990."

He went on to Edinburgh Training College and Glasgow University. He taught in Aberfeldy and later became tutor to John Sinclair who was later to become Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912. In 1885 he stood as crofter’s candidate for the parliamentary seat of Sutherland against the incumbent member, the Marquess of Stafford, who was eldest son of the Duke of Sutherland. Although he was unsuccessful, when there was a further election in 1886, the Marquess chose not to stand, and Sutherland was elected as an MP. After nine years as an MP, in 1894 he resigned his post and became Chairman of the Fishery Board. In this role he chaired the Scottish Departmental Committee on the North Sea Fishing Industry He was also a Member of Royal Commission on Highlands and Islands of Scotland, of the Congested Districts Board for Scotland and of the Royal Commission on Congestion in Ireland.

He lived in Fort Lee, New Jersey while pursuing a master's degree in Industrial Engineering at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. In 2000, during his brother's first term as President of Iran, rumors circulated in the Iranian press that Ali Khatami was involved in the distribution of \"videotapes in which the officials of the system were insulted\". These rumors were denied by the President's office, and described as an effort to exert pressure on the President by showing his family in a damaging light. In 2001, Mohammed Khatami named Ali as his chief of staff, after being elected to a second term as President."

A conscientious objector during the Second World War, he was first elected to the Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough Council in the 1950s, and became chairman of housing, at a time when Shoreditch had one of England's highest concentrations of municipal housing. Elected to the LCC for Shoreditch and Finsbury in 1952, he gave his time to housing and parks. County Hall, London, a Labour stronghold since 1934, was a pioneering model for Labour ideas and plans, including comprehensive education, school music, housing development and the establishment of the South Bank complex. As LCC chairman from 1963 to 1965, Arthur oversaw the transition in 1964 to the new Greater London Council and served on the GLC until 1981. He also owned two shops and a cafe in Islington. His main shop, selling everything from paraffin and groceries to hardware, served as an informal advice surgery. His wife, Daisy, died in 1992 and he was survived by his sons. One of his sons – Malcolm Wicks – who was a Labour Minister, died in September 2012 after a long illness, aged 65."

  "text" : "Angelo Tomás Reyes (March 17, 1945 – February 8, 2011) was the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff from 2000 to 2001 under President Joseph Estrada. At the height of the 2001 EDSA Revolution, Reyes withdrew his support for Estrada which led to the installation of Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as president, under whom he then served as cabinet secretary until to 2010, including with the portfolios of National Defense and Energy. Reyes ran for Congress under the United Transport Coalition (1-UTAK), a party representing workers in the public transportation sector, on the 2010 party-list election but was dropped by his party without his consent that led to litigation which was still ongoing at the time of his death. A week after being accused of corruption while being AFP chief of staff, Reyes died due to a gunshot wound in an apparent suicide. Reyes was married to Teresita P. Reyes with whom he has five sons, Pablo, Angelito, Marc, Carlo and Judd."

  "text" : "Alison Nampitjinpa Anderson (born 1958) is an Australian politician. She was member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2005 to 2016, representing the electorate of Namatijra (known as MacDonnell until 2012). Currently an independent, she has previously served as a minister for both the Australian Labor Party and Country Liberal Party and been territory leader of the Palmer United Party. Anderson entered the Northern Territory Assembly as a star candidate for the Australian Labor Party at the 2005 election. She was re-elected unopposed as the Member for MacDonnell in the August 2008 Territory election and with the subsequent return of the Henderson Labor Government was appointed to Cabinet. She held the positions of Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage; Minister for Parks and Wildlife; Minister for Arts and Museums; and Minister for Indigenous Policy. She left the Cabinet and the Labor Party in 2009 after a dispute over indigenous housing, and sat as an independent for two years. She then joined the opposition Country Liberal Party in 2011 and was elected as a Country Liberal candidate at the 2012 election. She resigned from the CLP in 2014, along with two other indigenous MPs, briefly becoming an independent once again. However, on 27 April 2014 it was announced that the three MLAs had joined the Palmer United Party, with Anderson serving as parliamentary leader. She resigned from Palmer United to sit as an independent on 29 November 2014. It was briefly rumoured that she was returning to the CLP amid the 2015 CLP leadership spill, but she remained an independent. Anderson speaks six indigenous languages: Anmatyerre, Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Western Arrernte and Yankunytjatjara. She is also an accomplished artist. She is among Australia's most senior indigenous politicians, and has been a prominent indigenous activist, including as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Central Zone Commissioner (see: List of Indigenous Australian politicians). Her partner is Nicolas Rothwell, journalist with The Australian. Anderson retired at the 2016 Territory election."

He held office until 1978, when he did not run for re-election for mayor. He was succeeded by Eugene Stranges. In 1981, he was elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor from Welland. While holding office, he was the morning radio farm reporter for the local radio station CHOW-AM. After several unsuccessful attempts to enter national politics at the Welland riding in the 1958, 1962 and 1979 federal elections, he won the riding in the 1984 federal election, defeating Liberal incumbent Gilbert Parent. Pietz only served one term, during the 33rd Canadian Parliament, as he was defeated in the 1988 federal election at the reorganized Welland—St. Catharines—Thorold riding by Parent. He made a political comeback in 1991 when he was again elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor for Welland. Shortly afterward, he ran for the Chairmanship of the Niagara Regional Council, but was defeated by Brian Merritt. He did not seek re-election in 1994 and has since retired from political life."

Born in 1901, he was one of the leaders of Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar (Tamrlipta National Government), which came into effect on 17 December 1942 during the Quit India Movement, a programme of civil disobedience launched in India in 1942. He was greatly influenced by Swami Vivekananda. Earlier a member of the Indian National Congress, he later became a leader in the Bangla Congress, which co-governed with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in two United Front governments in the 1960s and 1970s. He held the chief ministerial position in both these governments, from March to November 1967, and again from February 1969 to March 1970.In the year 1967 Ajoy Mukherjee defeated Prafulla Chandra Sen another Gandhian at Arambagh assembly constituency and became chief minister of West Bengal after Prafulla Chandra Sen. Architect of Ajoy Mukherjee's victory at Arambagh was Narayan Ch Ghosh the then students leader at arambagh. Narayan Ghosh accompanied Ajoy Mukherjee in a boat for several days to see sever flood effected areas in Arambagh & Ghatal subdivision during 1968. People of flood affected areas were enthused by Ajoy Mukherjee for his untired move to stand for them. Ajoy Mukherjee with some of his closed colleagues, viz. Pranob Mukherjee etc., joined Indian National Congress leaving Sushil Dhara- his long term associates. He was offered ministerial post at Centre by Indira Gandhi, but Ajoy Mukherjee saying his age and health condition had pushed Pranab Mukherjee. Pranab Mukherjee became State Minister in the Indian Cabinet. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award in 1977 from Government of India. His brother Biswanath Mukherjee was the husband of Geeta Mukherjee, a communist MP. Ajoy's niece Kalyani (daughter of another brother) was married to Mohan Kumaramangalam and was the mother of Rangarajan Kumaramangalam and Lalitha Kumaramangalam. Mukherjee died on May 27, 1986 in Calcutta."

  "text" : "Sir Andrew Beattie (6 August 1860 – 19 November 1923) was an Irish politician and public servant. Beattie was born in Rathfriland, County Down. For many years, both before and after the creation of the Irish Free State, he led the Unionist group on the Dublin City Council, of which he was an Alderman. He was also High Sheriff of Dublin, a Deputy Lieutenant for the City of Dublin, Commissioner of National Education for Ireland, and a Senator of the short-lived Parliament of Southern Ireland. He unsuccessfully contested the seat of West Down in the Parliament of the United Kingdom three times. Beattie stood for election to the 4th Dáil in the 1923 general election as an Independent candidate in Dublin South. He failed to win election by a margin of 490 votes less than anti-Treaty Sinn Féin candidate Charles Murphy. He was the most prominent Presbyterian politician in Dublin and was a member of Ormond Quay Presbyterian Church. He was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours for his services to Dublin and was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in the 1921 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\"."

Abdurrahman Vazirov was appointed by Kremlin to lead Soviet Azerbaijan in May, 1988, amidst the heating of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Vazirov replaced Kamran Baghirov, whose dismissal came along with similar dismissal of Karen Demirchyan and appointment of Suren Harutyunyan as the leader of the Soviet Armenia. Vazirov was a Soviet diplomat, who served in India, Nepal and Pakistan. He had been out of the Azerbaijan SSR for over a decade and therefore was untainted by the corruption. He was neither a typical political boss nor a local nationalist; he could not even speak fluent Azerbaijani. But at the same time, Vazirov was born in Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan SSR. Vazirov shared Mikhail Gorbachev's internationalist values and aspirations for political reform but he could not cope effectively with the complex political situation in Azerbaijan. He was also known as a fierce opponent of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan and later the 3rd president of independent Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev. Vazirov left Azerbaijan SSR amidst the Black January events in Baku, for which he was later sought by the Parliament of Azerbaijan as one of the responsible parties. On January 24, 1990, he was replaced in his position by Ayaz Mutallibov."

Throughout the six general elections he contested he was never opposed by a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Neil was an opponent of Japanese immigration to Canada saying in the House of Commons in 1922: \"Is it better to fight now when Japan controls only one-half of British Columbia or to leave the fighting until ten years hence when she will, by peaceful conquest, have absorbed the whole of British Columbia and have thousands of her trained troops scattered throughout British Columbia and the other provinces beyond the Rocky Mountains?\" A Middle School in Port Alberni was named A W Neill Middle School in his honour."

He graduated in Laws in Rio de Janeiro in 1915 and worked in Vitória as a public law attorney. In 1919 he began working as a teacher of World's History and Brazilian History at the school Gymnasium of Espirito Santo. In 1924, by invitation of the governor Florentino Ávidos, he occupied the functions of state's secretary for Education, for a brief time. In 1928, he was elected the 18th president (governor) of the state of Espírito Santo. It was in the time of his term as governor that the Wall Street's crisis took place, which especially affected Espirito Santo's economy, mostly dependent on the monoculture of the coffee back in that days. Also, Aristeu de Aguiar supported Júlio Prestes as candidate for the presidency of Brazil in the elections of March 1930. In spite those elections were actually won by Júlio Prestes, the loser candidate, Getúlio Vargas, alleging electoral fraud, launched a national rebellion in order to take the office as President of Brazil by force. Hence Aristeu de Aguiar was a supporter of Júlio Prestes, he abandoned the govern of Espirito Santo due to the invasion of the state by the troops of the colonel Otávio Campos do Amaral, supporter of Vargas' rebellion. Aguiar escaped to Portugal on board of the Italian cargo ship Atlanta. As his legal successor, the vice-governor Joaquim Teixeira de Mesquita, ran away as well, the President of Brazil, Washington Luís, appointed the legalist colonel José Armando Ribeiro de Paula as a provisional governor for the state."

  "text" : "Ajay Chattradhari Daby (अजय छट्रधारी द॓बी), born 29 December 1955, is a barrister and the former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Mauritius. He did his secondary schooling at the Royal College of Curepipe. Called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1978, Ajay Daby studied in the United Kingdom and is a member of The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, London. He is married to Geeta Prayag, a laureate of the Queen Elizabeth College and doctor from the Sheffield University. Daby started his legal career as a private legal practitioner before joining the State Law Office as State Prosecutor, but only for a very brief period. He soon resigned from his post in the Judiciary to join politics. Elected MP of the PSM in 1982 in Flacq-Bon Acceuil, Constituency No 9 at the age of 26, he became the youngest MP in the country. He was further elected as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Mauritius. In 1983, he was one of the founder members of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). He was in the same year, re-elected MP of Flacq-Bon Acceuil under the banner of the newly created MSM and went on to become the youngest Speaker of the Commonwealth and Association des Parlementaires de Langue Francaise (AIPLF). He was re-elected in Constituency No 11 (Rose-Belle/Vieux Grand Port) and was called upon to take the post of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly yet again. In 1990, on a question of principle, Mr Daby refused to give the casting vote much needed by the then government to change the status of Mauritius to that of a republic and sever ties with the British Crown. He voiced his dissent with his leader and party on this question. The MSM - MMM newly formed coalition not having the required three-quarters majority to expel Mr Daby from his Speakership, went ahead to amend the Constitution to enable the removal of the Speaker by a simple majority. On 5 December 1990, the Constitution of Mauritius was amended accordingly. Mr Daby then joined the Mauritius Labour Party, but for a brief spell only. In 2001, Mr Daby was made Commissionner for Drug Assets Forfeiture under the Government led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth ,and later by Paul Berenger, until 2005, when there was a change of Government following general elections . Daby is back at the Bar and is regularly seen in high profile cases."

  "text" : "Andor Jaross (May 23, 1896, Komáromcsehi, Komárom County – April 11, 1946) was an ethnic Hungarian politician from Slovakia and collaborator with the Nazis. Born in Komáromcsehi (Slovak: Čechy), in the Komárom County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia) he became general secretary of the United Hungarian Party, a group that sought to unite parts of Czechoslovakia with Hungary. As national chairman of the party he sought to forge a united Hungarian identity, claiming in his inaugural address that 'every member of the Hungarian minority should take a united stand on the issues of today and tomorrow'. Although effectively subordinate to János Esterházy in the party, Jaross became a well-known international figure, notably accepting an invitation to London from the Hungarian Committee of the House of Commons to present Hungarian grievances along with fellow United Hungarian Party MP Géza Szüllő. Moving to Hungary in 1938 he joined the government of Béla Imrédy as Minister for Regained Territories and was one of the 18 deputies who formed the Party of Hungarian Renewal in 1940 (a far right dissident group of the governing party). After the Nazi regime invaded Hungary in March 1944 and raised Nazi sympathizer Döme Sztójay to the Prime Minister's post, Jaross was put in charge of the Interior Ministry. From that position, he took charge of the country's Jews and, with his deputies László Endre and László Baky, was responsible for circumventing Miklós Horthy's plans by arranging their deportation. During this time Andross, Endre and Baky ran the Interior Ministry as a personal fiefdom and used it to eliminate their enemies, whilst also keeping Sztójay at arm's length in favour of German influence. The ghettoes were inspected in August 1944 by Adolf Eichmann and Dieter Wisliceny and, although the Jewish Council sent appeals for better treatment direct to Jaross and Eichmann, the extermination proceeded. A growing figure in Hungarian public life, Jaross even became president of football club Ferencvárosi TC in 1944. Removed from his position in August 1944 (after appropriating much Jewish property) he made a brief return in October 1944, after the Nazis deposed Horthy and installed the rabidly anti-Semitic Arrow Cross Party to head the government under Prime Minister Ferenc Szálasi. After the war, Jaross was tried by the Hungarian authorities and executed by firing squad."

At the head of the ticket were two different candidates, Roger Calero and James Harris; Harris was an alternate in some states because Calero was Constitutionally ineligible because he is a lawful permanent resident of the United States (holding a green card), and not a US Citizen. They were the first pair to qualify for the ballot in Louisiana Calero/Kennedy won 5,127 votes and Harris/Kennedy 2,424. Originally from Indianapolis, Kennedy joined the socialist movement in 1973 in Louisville, Kentucky. She has worked in coal mines in Alabama, Colorado, Utah, and West Virginia. In 1977 she ran as the SWP candidate for mayor of Cleveland, Ohio against incumbent Republican Ralph Perk, garnering 1,225 votes and losing by a wide margin to Dennis Kucinich. She first joined the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1981, and was one of the leaders of a strike in Utah 2004, also being involved in litigation. In 2000, she ran for United States Senate as a certified write-in candidate in a race prompted by the death of candidate and former Governor of Missouri Mel Carnahan. Kennedy is currently employed as a garment worker. On February 12, 2016, Kennedy was announced as the nominee for president on the Socialist Workers Party ticket alongside Osborne Hart. Kennedy is the second woman to be the presidential nominee of the SWP and the first since Linda Jenness. She is on the ballot in seven states: Utah, Louisiana, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Washington and New Jersey."

  "text" : "Amand Landry (December 8, 1805 – July 12, 1877) was an Acadian farmer and political figure in New Brunswick. He represented Westmorland County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1846 to 1850, from 1853 to 1857 and from 1861 to 1870. He was born in Memramcook, New Brunswick, the son of Allain Landry and Anastasie Dupuis, and was educated there. His mother was a descendant of Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour who had been governor of Acadia. Landry taught school for a time. He married Pélagie Caissie in 1839. He was defeated by William Crane in 1850 but was elected in a by-election held in 1853 after Crane died. Landry opposed Confederation and railway construction, viewing both as not benefiting Acadians. He died in Memramcook at the age of 71. His son Pierre-Amand served in the provincial assembly and the Canadian House of Commons."

  "text" : "Angelito Cabaron Gatlabayan (born July 3, 1952) is a Filipino politician. He was the first City Mayor of Antipolo following its transition to cityhood, serving from 1998 to 2007. A member of the House of Representatives of the Philippines, representing the 2nd District of Antipolo City during the 14th Congress, from 2007 to 2008. An Antipolonian native as he was born and raised in the City to parents Former Vice Mayor Maximo Leyva Gatlabayan and Catalina Legado Cabaron. Before his stint as the City Mayor of Antipolo for (9) consecutive years, he worked and held top positions in various multinational companies such as Handyware Philippines, Macstrat Incorporated, N.P Foods Company, Nagai Package Company, Philippine Cellophane Film Corporation and Union Ajinomoto Philippines. At the dawn of Antipolo's transition into cityhood he was then elected as its first local chief executive on May 15, 1998 and was then re-elected to a second term via landslide victory by more than 42,000 votes last May 5, 2001. Mayor Gatlabayan guides the second largest municipality in Rizal Province, exercising authority over Antipolo City's 800,000 million budget and representing its 500 thousand residents. Under his leadership, Antipolo City experienced an all-time high in tax revenues, the lowest unemployment rate in decades, a substantial improvement in healthcare services and a progressive and comprehensive relocation and housing program for the needy. He was able to put the City's economic resources at a high point. His administration had focused on restoring ethics to the local government and elevating quality of life in the community, while utilizing fiscally sensible strategies and policies in reducing crime, corruption and illiteracy - Likewise, He has been streamlining and making government services more efficient and accessible for his constituents. Since he was elected, Mayor ACG has combined a substantial legislative record. The first initiative of his administration was the comprehensive crime fighting measures, where crime rate level is at its lowest in the last 20 years. The highly successful clean and green program, where streets are cleaned constantly, canals and streams are dredge periodically and tree planting for an eco-friendly environment. This program earned the city GAWAD SA PANGULO SA KAPALIGIRAN AWARD (1st Place for the Cleanest and Greenest City in Region IV and 2nd Place at the National Level). Troubled by the worsening illiteracy condition of youth and adults in the city, He unveiled his most ambitious undertaking in his last five years, this initiative called for championing the rights of the children. Thus in 1999, the literacy program was conceived. It details long range plans to better prepare less privilege children for school. It motiveates out-of-school youths and adults to pursue and education or skill. It facilitates the re-education of Dumagats ethnic group. It provides teaching facilities, faculty members, books, notebooks and classrooms in all 16 barangays. A remarkable feat worth mentioning is that the young Mayor was able to establish 14 Public High Schools in different barangays in just 1 year. Economic development is another priority for him, In alleviating the poor sectors of the city, His most important triumph for the economic revitalization of Antipolo was the revolutionary way of increasing revenues from a P140 Million mark to P600 Million in his first term alone. This paved way for building modern infrastructures, systematized water system, facilitating lightning fixtures throughout the City. At year 2007, He ended his post as the City Mayor and then was elected once again via landslide victory as the 2nd District Representative of Antipolo City. He was a member of Eleven (11) standing Committees back at the Congress, which includes the Committee on Appropriation which passed the 2008 General Appropriations Act or the 2008 National Budget."

  "text" : "Dato' Sri Anifah Aman (born 16 November 1953) is a Malaysian politician who has served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia since 2009. He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which is part of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, and the Member of Parliament for Kimanis in Sabah. From 1999 to 2008 he was a deputy minister in successive Barisan Nasional governments. Anifah was first elected to Parliament in 1999, winning the seat of Beaufort. He was immediately appointed Deputy Minister of Primary Industries in the government of Mahathir Mohamad. He shifted to, and won, the seat of Kimanis in the 2004 election, and became Deputy Minister for Plantation Industries and Commodities. After winning re-election in the 2008 general election, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi appointed him as Deputy Transport Minister. However, Anifah refused, saying he felt it was \"time to make way\" for someone else. Reports indicated this was the first time anyone had refused an appointment as Deputy Minister after the appointment had already been made public. A day later, the New Straits Times reported that Anifah and another proposed Deputy Minister, Tengku Azlan Abu Bakar, had \"thrown a tantrum ... claiming they are 'senior enough' to be made full ministers.\" Abdullah reportedly told them that he had \"picked the best people\", leading to their resignations. After Najib Razak replaced Abdullah as Prime Minister in 2009, Anifah was promoted from the backbench to the Cabinet as Minister for Foreign Affairs. During Anifah's tenure as Foreign Minister, Malaysia won election as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2015–2016 term."

  "text" : "Alain Joyandet (born 15 January 1954) is a French politician who was appointed Secretary of State for Cooperation and Francophony in the government of François Fillon from March 18, 2008 to July 2010. Prior to that, he was CEO of the Société Nouvelle des Éditions Comtoises (SNEC), a publisher of weekly newspapers and journals. He is a journalist by training. He has been mayor of Vesoul since 1995 and senator of Franche-Comté from 1995 to 2002. In 2010, he won the UMP nomination for President of Franche-Comté, but lost to socialist candidate Marie-Guite Dufay in the general election. At the end of March 2010 Joyandet made headlines for spending 116,500 euros of taxpayers' money chartering a private jet to fly him to Martinique to an international conference on Haiti and back to Paris. On 4 July 2010, he resigned his government post, the same day as Christian Blanc, Secretary of State for Development of the capital region. The French press had reported the suspected misuse of public money by the two ministers. Alain Joyandet was accused of renting a private jet to € 116,500 to travel to Martinique, where he was to attend an international conference for reconstruction after the earthquake of Haiti. An article in the Canard Enchaîné also suspected of having received an illegal building permit for his house of Grimaud, which he abandoned shortly after."

  "text" : "Alexander Rankin (December 31, 1788 – April 3, 1852) was a Scottish-born merchant and political figure in New Brunswick. He represented Northumberland County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1827 to 1852. He was born and educated in Mearns parish, the brother of Robert Rankin, and son of James Rankin and Helen Ferguson. His uncles, John Pollok and Arthur Pollok, were cofounders of Pollok, Gilmour and Company. At the age of 18, he was hired as a clerk by Pollok, Gilmour and Company, a Glasgow firm that dealt in timber, and was sent with James Gilmour to New Brunswick to establish a branch of the firm (Gilmour, Rankin and Company) on the Miramichi River. They established a small community called Gretna Green (later Douglastown) as well as stores, wharves and a sawmill. Besides exporting timber, they also sold goods supplied from Scotland. In 1825, the operation suffered extensive damage in the Miramichi Fire. However, they were able to rebuild quickly with the help of the parent company. Rankin also became involved in timber operations at Bathurst (Ferguson, Rankin and Company), Dalhousie and Campbellton (Arthur Ritchie and Company). In politics as well as in his timber operations, Rankin frequently found himself competing with Joseph Cunard. In elections in 1837 and 1843, Rankin supported John Ambrose Street against candidates supported by Cunard. Gilmour retired from the business in 1842, selling his interest to Rankin. Rankin was named to the province's Executive Council in 1847. With Cunard, he was a commissioner for lights in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and served on the board of health for the region. For many years, he also served as justice of the peace. Rankin died unexpectedly in Liverpool during a visit to England at the age of 63."

He is a member of the People's Justice Party (PKR) in the Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition. Azan was elected to Parliament in the 2008 general election, defeating Salamon Ali Rizal Abdul Rahman of the governing Barisan Nasional coalition by 1,027 votes. He was a member of PKR's leadership in Pahang before resigning in 2010, citing dissatisfaction with PKR's management. He subsequently became the leader of PKR in the neighbouring state of Terengganu, and was elected to the State Assembly there, for the seat of Bandar, in 2013. His election unseated the incumbent Barisan Nasional assemblyman, Toh Chin Yaw, and was part of a swing to Pakatan Rakyat in the state that saw them win 15 of 32 assembly seats. Azan's move to Terengganu was carried out at the direction of PKR's national leader Anwar Ibrahim and involved Azan relinquishing renomination for his federal parliamentary seat."

When the Workers' Union amalgamated with the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1929 he became Cambridge and District Officer for the TGWU. A member of Cambridgeshire County Council from 1931 to his death and Cambridge Borough Council from 1923 to 1949 (and an alderman of both from 1942), he served as Labour Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire from 1945 to 1950, when he lost his seat to the Conservatives (he had lost the general election for Cambridge in 1922 by only 679 votes). He is the only Labour MP to have ever sat for a Cambridgeshire constituency outside the city of Cambridge itself (although  Peterborough, which was during his lifetime outside the county, has been represented by Labour MPs).

  "text" : "Alexander Campbell DesBrisay (1828 – April 8, 1873) was a French Canadian businessman and politician in the Province of New Brunswick. The son of Solomon DesBrisay, and his wife, Mary Campbell, he was a descendant of Captain Théophile de la Cour DesBrisay (1671–1761) whose Huguenot family fled religious persecution in France and settled in Dublin, Ireland before emigrating to Canada. Alexander DesBrisay was born in Bathurst, New Brunswick and educated at a public school. As an adult, he was a successful businessman in both the lumber and fishing industries. He married Jane Finnis with whom he had six sons and three daughters. A supporter of the Province of New Brunswick joining the proposed Canadian Confederation, in the February 21, 1865 New Brunswick general election, DesBrisay was voted into office as the Confederation Party representative for Restigouche County in an election won by an Anti-Confederation Party made up of a coalition of Conservatives and Reformers led by Albert J. Smith. DesBrisay was reelected in the 1866 New Brunswick general election won by his party. On August 16, 1867, Premier Andrew Wetmore appointed him to the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. He held this appointment until May 25, 1870, when the Administration was re-organized under the leadership of the new Liberal-Conservative Party Premier, George E. King. He was returned to office again in the 1870 provincial election. That fall he resigned his seat in order to run in the November 25 Federal by-election for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons for the constituency of Restigouche to replace William Murray Caldwell who had died in office. Unsuccessful in his bid for federal office, DesBrisay returned to private business but died a few years later from smallpox at Dalhousie, New Brunswick. He is buried in the Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Bathurst."

  "text" : "Alberto Dahik Garzozi (born August 27, 1953) is an Ecuadorian politician of Lebanese ancestry. Dahik was educated in economics in Princeton University. He served as Finance Minister during 1986 (when he was impeached) and member of Congress from 1988 to 1992. It was during this tenure, in October 1990, that he was involved in a highly publicized incident while a congressional fight was taking place: he was hit by an ashtray tossed by a Roldosist congressman. At the end of 1991, Dahik's Conservative Party established an alliance with Sixto Durán Ballén's Republican Union Party and chose Dahik as his running mate for the 1992 presidential election, which he won against Jaime Nebot. As Vice President in Durán Ballén's administration, Dahik was responsible in designing economic policies. He was important member of Conservative Party. In 1995, the Supreme Court announced that it had enough evidence to arrest Dahik on charges of embezzlement, but Dahik managed to flee to Costa Rica where he was granted political assylum by that country on March 30, 1996. Dahik briefly returned to Ecuador in April 2005 after his process was annulled by the so-called Pichicorte, unconstitutionally set by Lucio Gutierrez's government. Ecuador's constitution enacted the necessity of an impeachment process in Parliament for the President and Vice-President before any legal procedure in Court regarding Office's exercise. The process was set up and Dahik was declared innocent by both Parliament and The State's public funds control Agency, turning then his trial unconstitutional and illegal. On December 23, 2011 Dahik returned to Ecuador after 16 years of exile, a year after President Rafael Correa called on the National Assembly of Ecuador to grant him amnesty, based on his belief that Dahik is an honest man. His prison order was lifted in order to present himself to a judge every two weeks as precautionary measure. His first appearance at the court occurred on December 26. On January 20, 2012, Dahik was acquitted by the First Chamber of the National Court of Justice on the basis that he was subjected to a \"judicial atrocity\". His case was finally archived in March 2013."

His left wing political beliefs were forged early in his life when, as an apprentice fitter in Rugby, he was sacked during the 1926 General Strike at 17 years of age. That experience was never forgotten and was the basis for the many years of Trade Union membership and Union activist. He married Edith Muriel Collins (Lila) in 1935 and fathered two daughters and five sons. He left the railways in 1940 and moved to Coventry only to see the family home and all possessions destroyed in the wartime bombing within months of settling. His Union activities and membership of the local Labour Party was to propel him to being elected to the Coventry City Council in 1945. Within 15 years he was appointed Deputy Leader of the Labour Group and leading the various committees responsible for the redevelopment of the war torn City, regarded by many as one of the chief architects of the Coventry's reconstruction. Elected Lord Mayor of Coventry in 1962, he presided at the Consecration of the Coventry Cathedral and made an Honorary Freeman of the City in later years, retiring from active politics in 1990 after 45 years as a Councillor. A man of great political skills whose motto was \"The rent of life is service.\" Waugh died in 1995 less than a year after losing his wife."

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Alexandre Banza (1932 – 12 April 1969) was a military officer and politician in the Central African Republic. Born in Carnot, Ubangi-Shari, Banza served with the French Army during the First Indochina War before joining the Central African Republic armed forces. As commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in 1965, Banza helped Jean-Bédel Bokassa overthrow the government of President David Dacko. Bokassa rewarded Banza by appointing him as minister of state and minister of finance in the new government. Banza quickly established the new regime's reputation abroad and forged diplomatic relations with other countries. In 1967, Bokassa and his protégé had a major argument over the president's extravagances. In April 1968, Bokassa removed Banza as minister of finance. Recognizing Bokassa's attempts to undermine him, Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of the president's handling of the government. Bokassa responded by abolishing the minister of state position. Banza soon decided to stage a coup d'état. He confided in a few military officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of the date of the coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case to a military tribunal, which quickly sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in Time and Le Monde. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators."

He was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, the younger son of Abel Buckley and Mary Keehan of Alderdale Lodge. He was educated at Mill Hill School and Owen's College. In 1875 he married Hannah Summers (who died in 1897) and they had one son, also Abel, born in 1876. The Buckley family owned two cotton mills in Ashton: Ryecroft and Oxford Road, and Abel became involved in the business. At his death he was described as \"one of the old cotton lords of Lancashire\". In 1885 Buckley inherited Ryecroft Hall, Audenshaw, from his uncle, James Smith Buckley, and was to live there for the rest of his life. He subsequently inherited Galtee Castle, near Mitchelstown, County Cork. The estate had been purchased by his uncle, Nathaniel Buckley, MP for Stalybridge in 1873. In 1885 Abel Buckley was elected Liberal MP for the newly created Prestwich constituency. In the general election of the following year, however, he was defeated. Apart from his interests in the cotton industry, Buckley was a director and chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company and a justice of the peace. He was a collector of fine art, and a racehorse breeder. He died at Ryecroft Hall on 23 December 1908, aged 73."

  "text" : "Andrew McElwee (died 18 June 1968) was a British trades unionist and Labour Party politician. McElwee joined the Clydebank branch of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers in 1907. He subsequently transferred to a union branch in Brixton, London. He was elected to the union's general council and was chairman from 1924 to 1926. He was nominated as the Labour Party candidate for the Manchester constituency of Hulme with the support of the woodworkers' union, but failed to win the seat at the 1924 general election. In 1925 he was chairman of the Dumbarton and Clydebank Labour Party, and gave evidence to an enquiry into the Clydebank Rents Strike. McElwee again stood at Hulme at the 1929 general election, and was elected. However, he became involved in a dispute with his sponsoring union, who refused to support him at the ensuing election in 1931. The Divisional Labour Party asked him to stand down as candidate, but he refused to do, and after a search for a replacement candidate he received the Labour nomination. He was defeated, with the Conservative Party regaining the constituency. In February 1932 the executive council and a number of officials of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers issued summonses alleging criminal libel against the former MP. The allegations centred on statements made in four letters written by McElwee about the union. The letters accused identifiable officials of corruption and of misappropriation of expenses. In May 1932 he entered a plea of guilty to the charges and was bound over to keep the peace on his personal recognisance of £100."

  "text" : "Alan Herbert is a Canadian politician and activist, who was an NPA member of Vancouver City Council from 1996 to 1999. A prominent gay activist in Vancouver, Herbert was instrumental in securing a liquor licence for the Fountainhead Pub, one of the city's primary gay bars, and in helping to develop Davie Village. He was also a chair of the Vancouver Pride Society and AIDS Vancouver, and a founder of McLaren House, Canada's first housing centre for people with HIV and AIDS. However, Herbert's activism in securing the Fountainhead liquor license resulted in his becoming one of two candidates, along with Nancy Chiavario, dropped from the NPA's candidate slate in the 1999 municipal elections. He entered discussions with the Coalition of Progressive Electors to join their slate, but COPE had room for only one of the two candidates and chose Chiavario. He ran as an independent candidate, but was not re-elected to council. In the 2002 municipal elections, Herbert and Chiavario were both involved in the creation of vcaTeam, a new candidate slate which was not successful in electing candidates to council. Herbert has continued to participate in Vancouver politics as an activist. He remains on the board of the Vancouver Pride Society, participated in the campaign to save St. Paul's Hospital from closure in 2005, and supported transgender activist Jamie Lee Hamilton's 2008 campaign for election to the Vancouver Park Board."

  "text" : "Alfred Illingworth (25 September 1827 – 1907), was an English worsted spinner and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1868 and 1895. Illingworth was born at Bradford, Yorkshire, the son of Daniel Illingworth and his wife Elizabeth Hill. He was educated at Huddersfield College and entered the family worsted spinning business of D Illingworth & Sons at the age of 16. In 1865, with his brother Henry, he established the Whetley Mills, one of the largest factories in Bradford. He was also a director of the Bradford District Bank. He had strong non-conformist and free trade views and entered into politics. At the 1868 general election, Illingworth was elected MP for Knaresborough, but lost the seat in 1874. He was then elected at Bradford at the 1880 general election until the constituency was reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. At the 1885 general election he was elected for Bradford West and held the seat until 1895. Illingworth married Margaret Holden, daughter of Sir Isaac Holden, 1st Baronet in 1863 and his brother Henry married another daughter of Holden creating a strong alliance of two of the dominant Bradford families of the time. Henry was the father of Percy Illingworth and Albert Illingworth who were also active in politics in Yorkshire."

  "text" : "Ann C. Whitman (June 11, 1908 – October 15, 1991) was a native of Perry, Ohio. She briefly attended Antioch College in Ohio and then moved to New York in 1929 to obtain work as a secretary. For many years she was the personal secretary to Mrs. David Levy, whose father was one of the founders of Sears, Roebuck and Company. In 1941 she married Edmund S. Whitman, an official of the United Fruit Company. In 1952, while working as a secretary in the New York office of the Crusade for Freedom, Mrs. Whitman was recruited by Dwight D. Eisenhower’s presidential campaign staff. She went to Eisenhower’s headquarters at Denver, Colorado where she became Eisenhower’s personal secretary. After Eisenhower was elected president, Mrs. Whitman accompanied him to Washington, D.C., and served as his personal secretary the entire eight years of his presidency. She helped manage Eisenhower’s correspondence and was responsible for maintaining Eisenhower’s personal files which he kept in his office at the White House. When President Eisenhower left office in January 1961, Mrs. Whitman accompanied him to his farm (now the Eisenhower National Historic Site) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and continued to work for a few months as his personal secretary. She later joined the staff of New York Governor and later Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, for whom she worked until she retired in 1977. A biography of Whitman, entitled Confidential Secretary, was written by journalist Robert Donovan in 1988."

Firth and Nordling thereafter sat as the only members of the Independent Alliance. Nordling later rejoined the Yukon Party and ran in the 1996 election as a Yukon Party candidate, but was defeated by Yukon Liberal Party candidate Pat Duncan."

It was his third attempt to enter the House of Commons, having stood unsuccessfully in Thornbury in 1895 and in the Eastern Division of Dorset in 1900 general election (losing in 1900 by only 96 votes). Christchurch had been held by the Conservative Party since 1885, and at the general election in January 1910, Allen lost his seat to a Conservative. At the next general election, in December 1910, he stood instead in the Scottish constituency of Dunbartonshire, where he won the seat. However, at the 1918 general election he was not one of the 159 Liberal candidates to receive the \"coalition coupon\", and was overwhelmingly defeated by the Coalition Conservative candidate Sir William Raeburn; Allen was pushed into a poor third place behind the Labour Party candidate, winning a meagre 13% of the votes. After his defeat in 1918, he did not stand for Parliament again."

In 2001, Brolly was elected as a councillor to Limavady Borough Council for the electoral area of Benbradagh. She topped the first preference votes with 1056, and her husband came in second with 917. He was also elected to the Council. The quota was 840. In 2003, Brolly took over from George Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as the Mayor of Limavady. At Christmas 2003 she was asked to switch on the Christmas tree lights for Burnfoot. There was a small Loyalist protest during the switching-on of the lights because of the election of a Sinn Féin mayor. Afterwards, the tree was cut down by vandals and the lights smashed. On 14 June 2004 Councillor Brolly stood down as Mayor. In October 2004, the High Court of Northern Ireland ordered the government to provide the Brolly couple with protection, following reports of threats from the Red Hand Defenders, a Loyalist paramilitary group. In 2005, she was re-elected to the Council, but this time for the Limavady Town electoral area. She garnered 657 first preference votes, a total of 17.6% of the vote. She was the only Sinn Féin councillor elected in that area, coming third behind George Robinson and Alan Robinson both of the DUP. In January 2008, Brolly and another councillor were confronted by a crowd in an \"extremely nasty mood\" outside the council's offices. Police were called."

  "text" : "Sir Alfred Hopkinson (28 June 1851 – 11 November 1939) was an English lawyer, academic and politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for two three-year periods, separated by nearly thirty years. He was the son of John Hopkinson, a mechanical engineer, and among his brothers were John Hopkinson, a physicist and electrical engineer, and Edward Hopkinson, an electrical engineer and MP. He first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he was the unsuccessful Liberal Party candidate in Manchester East. He was unsuccessful again as a Liberal Unionist candidate at the 1892 general election, when he stood in Manchester South-West. Hopkinson finally won a seat at the 1895 general election, when he was elected as MP for Cricklade in Wiltshire. He resigned from Parliament in February 1898, by the procedural device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. Hopkinson was Vice-Chancellor of the Victoria University from 1901 to 15 July 1903 and then of the Victoria University of Manchester until 1913. In December 1914 he was appointed to the Committee on Alleged German Outrages, which in May 1915 reported on German war crimes against civilians during the invasion of Belgium in the opening months of World War I. He received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. He returned to Parliament in March 1926, when he won a by-election for the Combined English Universities. He did not contest the 1929 general election. A sculpture of him by John Cassidy was exhibited at Manchester in 1912. His son Austin Hopkinson also became a Member of Parliament. One of his daughters married Sir Gerald Hurst M.P."

He spent time in southern and eastern Africa as a miner and prospector before returning to Australia to farm. In 1966, he became New South Wales State Chairman of the Young Australian Country Party, holding the position until 1968 when he was appointed to the state council, serving until 1984. He was elected to Carrathool Shire Council in 1970 and remained until 1974. He was chairman of the Rankins Springs branch of the party from 1972 to 1984. In 1984, Cruickshank was selected as the National candidate for the state seat of Murrumbidgee, which was being vacated by sitting Labor member Lin Gordon. Cruickshank finished third on the primary votes behind Labor candidate Margaret Delves and independent Thomas Marriott, but with Liberal preferences pushed into second place and was elected the victor on Marriott's preferences, with a margin of 51.52%. Partly due to redistributions which greatly strengthened the National Party in Murrumbidgee, Cruickshank faced no further serious challenges and was re-elected in 1988, 1991, and 1995. He retired in 1999 and was succeeded as National MP for the seat by Adrian Piccoli. On 21 May 2010, Cruickshank died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from pneumonia."

  "text" : "(This is a Malay name; the name Abdul Ghani is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Amran.) Amran Abdul Ghani (born 12 August 1973) was the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Tanah Merah constituency in Kelantan from 2008 to 2013, sitting as a member of the People's Justice Party (PKR) in the Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition. Amran was elected to the Tanah Merah seat in the 2008 election, defeating the incumbent Shaari Hassan of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Shaari alleged that members of UMNO (his own party) sabotaged his campaign. Amran did not recontest the seat in the 2013 election. Instead, he shifted to the state of Johor to contest the State Assembly seat of Paloh, losing to UMNO's long-serving incumbent Norzula Mat Diah. Some local PKR members objected to Amran being parachuted into the state as a candidate and publicly supported Norzula instead."

  "text" : "Austin Taylor (1858 – 27 April 1955) was a Conservative Party, later Liberal Party, politician in the United Kingdom. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool East Toxteth at a by-election in November 1902 following the resignation of the Conservative MP Augustus Frederick Warr. He was re-elected unopposed in 1906. He was a Unionist Free Trader and resigned from the Conservative Party in February 1906, crossing the floor to join the Liberal Party. He stood down from the House of Commons at the January 1910 general election. In June 1918, the Liberal MP for Buckrose became ill and was looking to retire. The local Liberal Association selected Taylor as their candidate to succeed him. Due to the war-time electoral truce, Taylor expected to be elected in a by-election unopposed. However, the by-election was not called and a General Election was called for December instead. A Labour candidate was chosen to contest the seat. Taylor hoped to receive endorsement from the Coalition government, but at the eleventh hour, that endorsement was given to a latecomer to the contest, who stood as a Coalition Liberal and was elected instead."

Zahid, seen as an ally of deposed Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, was subsequently arrested and held in prison under the Internal Security Act. However, in 1999, Zahid was welcomed back into the UMNO fold, stating that Anwar had put him up to raising allegations of cronyism and nepotism and alleging that Anwar had used his position as Finance Minister to direct business opportunities to Zahid. After the 2004 election, Zahid became a Deputy Minister in the government of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. While a Deputy Minister, Zahid studied for and was conferred the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Universiti Putra Malaysia. After the 2008 election, Zahid became a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department. He was appointed Minister of Defence in April 2009.Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was appointed as Minister of Home Affairs in 2013, replacing Hishamuddin Hussein.

He was elected at the 1906 general election as Member of Parliament for the Ramsey division of Huntingdonshire, a constituency which had been held by Conservatives since its creation in 1885. He was defeated at the January 1910 general election; He was unsuccessful when he stood again in December 1910. Boulton did not stand again until the 1923 general election, when he fought the Conservative-held New Forest and Christchurch division of Hampshire. The seat had not been contested in either 1918 or 1922, and in a straight contest with the sitting Conservative MP, Boulton won 46% of the votes. Boulton stood again at the 1924 general election, when a Labour candidate also contested the seat. The Conservative vote increased, and Boulton's second-placed vote was less than half the Tory total. He did not stand for Parliament again."

Before entering federal politics, Abdul Ghapur was active in Sabah state politics, initially as a member of the Sabah People's United Front (commonly known as BERJAYA). He joined UMNO when it moved into the state in the early 1990s and was a Deputy Chief Minister in the Barisan Nasional state government between 1995 and 1997. He was elected unopposed to federal Parliament in 2004, for the newly created seat of Kalabakan on the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in East Sabah. In 2008, after his reelection (again unopposed), he was appointed as a Deputy Minister for Resources and Natural Environment by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, only to resign eight days later. Later that year he openly criticised the Barisan Nasional government in Parliament for overlooking the needs states of Sabah and Sarawak, which had voted resoundingly in favour of Barisan Nasional in the 2008 election. He again spoke out against the federal government for what he considered to be its slow response to the invasion of part of East Sabah by Filipino militants in 2013. At the same time, he criticsed UMNO's internal election process as being open to corruption, claiming that \"people will do anything just to get on the Supreme Council even if it’s very expensive\"."

Goldman started coursing engineering in the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo when he was 18. When the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état took place, he was a militant of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB), that was outcast by law. Soon after the AI-5, he became a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). After the end of the MDB in the late 1970s, he became a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). He went back to PCB but ended up switching it for PMDB in 1987. From 1992-1994, he served as the Transport Minister of Itamar Franco presidency. In 1996, he left PMDB and became a member of PSDB and was elected two years later a federal deputy. He served as governor of the state of São Paulo from April 2010 to January 2011, replacing José Serra that resigned from office in order to run for the presidency in 2010, and was succeeded by the current governor Geraldo Alckmin. He currently serves as National Vice President of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party. The president is senator Aécio Neves, who is most likely to be the candidate of the party in the 2014 race for the presidency."

Dagang then replaced Moggie in the Kanowit seat when the latter stepped down for the 2004 general election. After the election, Dagang's Sarawak Native People's Party was de-registered, and he joined the Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party and later the PRS. He retained the Kanowit seat in the 2008 election unopposed. Dagang received the Panglima Jasa Negara (PJN), an award entitling him to use the title 'Datuk', in 2010."

Along with brother, Mitra, Sinanan helped draft portions of Trinidad’s constitution and later went on to serve as the country’s first High Commissioner to India. High office, however, ultimately eluded him: first, in his 1958 bid to become the first Prime Minister of the Federation of the West Indies, a contest that he narrowly lost by 2 seats to Barbados’ Sir Grantley Adams; and second, in 1974, when he resigned from his post as High Commissioner to India to found the West Indian National Party (WINP). The WINP ultimately failed to break the 20-year rule of then Prime Minister, Dr. Eric Williams. Notable career highlights: \n*  Elected to Legislative Council, Victoria Constituency, (1950) \n*  Member of Parliament, San Fernando \n*  Founder, Democratic Labour Party and Opposition Leader (1951-1956)  \n*  Acting Speaker of the House, Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago (1955-1956) \n*  Chairman, Constitution Reform Committee (1955) \n*  Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago to the Office of the U.N. and Specialized Agencies in Geneva (1973) \n*  High Commissioner to India (1974) Awards: \n*  Chaconia Gold Medal awarded for Public Service (1990)"

That was by the request of the Russian Provisional Government that demanded to have several members of Russian political background. Later after the dismissal of the first government and its reorganization in the next government Zarubin held two positions. Since July and until the end of fall he served as the state controller, beside his secretarial assignment as the secretary of Post and Telegraph services. Zarubin also was elected to the delegation together with Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Ivan Steshenko that was scheduled to meet with the government of Alexander Kerensky on October 21, which was accusing the Vynnychenko's government in separatism. Later that meeting was canceled due to the Bolshevik coup-d'etat. Further fate of the politician is unknown."

  "text" : "Alfredo Covelli (February 22, 1914 – December 25, 1998) was an Italian politician, the leader of the Monarchist National Party. Covelli was born in Bonito, Campania. He graduated in literature and philosophy, in law and political science in the second half of the 1930s, and in 1940 he was a teacher of Latin and Greek in a grammar school in Benevento. He took part in the Second World War as official in the Air Force, and after a series of operations in Tirana and Bari, he received a decoration for military valor. In 1946 he was elected a Member of Parliament as a candidate for the National Bloc of Freedom and in the referendum of 2 June he voted to keep the House of Savoy as the royal house of Italy. In July of the same year he founded the Monarchist National Party, of which he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1948, and so would be until 1976. In the meantime he also devoted himself to journalism, becoming director of the Nation Courier. In 1964 Covelli also held a management role in football, becoming advisor of the SS Lazio. In the 1970s he merged his party into the Italian Social Movement, which then became the MSI-DN (the DN standing for destra nazionale or national right). After the merger he duly became chairman of the MSI. In 1977 Covelli split from the MSI and founded National Democracy a national-conservative political party. After receiving a meager result of .06% of the vote in the election of 1979 Covelli retired from the political scene. On January 15, 1998, he was appointed by Victor Emmanuel of Savoy honorary president of the honorific Council of the Senators of the Kingdom. At his request, he was buried in Bonito, his birthplace."

  "text" : "Alvin Michael Greene (born August 30, 1977) is a Democrat from South Carolina. He was the Democratic Party's nominee in the 2010 United States Senate election in South Carolina. He was defeated by incumbent Republican Sen. Jim DeMint by a margin of 61.46% to 27.65%, with most of the remaining votes going to Green Party candidate and environmental activist Tom Clements. He was the first African-American to be nominated for U.S. Senate by a major party in South Carolina. In the general election, Greene faced DeMint, Green Party candidate Tom Clements and write-in candidates Nathalie Dupree and Mazie Ferguson. Greene won the Democratic primary race against candidate Vic Rawl on June 8, 2010, with 59% of the vote, despite very limited campaigning and campaign spending, and having no website and no yard signs. The executive committee of the South Carolina Democratic Party voted 55 to 10 to reject Rawl's request for a new Senate primary after questions were raised about Greene's surprise victory. Greene graduated from the University of South Carolina in 2000 with a degree in political science. He is a United States military veteran who served in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force before receiving an involuntary honorable discharge in 2009. At the time of his Senate campaign, Greene was unemployed and living with and caring for his father in Manning. On August 13, 2010, it was announced that he had been indicted on criminal charges of showing pornographic pictures to an 18-year-old female college student. Greene was reportedly considering a run for President of the United States in 2012, but later declined. On December 24, 2010, Greene filed as a candidate in the Democratic primary special election for the South Carolina House of Representatives seat left vacant by the death of Representative Cathy Harvin. The primary was held on February 15, 2011; Greene received 37 votes."

Whitecross was elected the third ACT Legislative Assembly at the 1995 general election as a Labor member. He succeeded former Chief Minister Rosemary Follett as Leader of the Opposition in March 1996, and continued in that position until his replacement by Wayne Berry in August 1997. He recontested the seat at the 1998 general election, but was unsuccessful. Whitecross and his successor Berry are the only ALP leaders who did not become Chief Ministers and Whitecross is the only ALP leader who did not lead the party into an election. With a caucus of six members Whitecross was able to replace Follett as leader when he and two caucus colleagues tapped Follett on the shoulder which convinced her to stand down as leader."

Born into a peasant family in Château-Landon in the Seine-et-Marne department of France, Arthur Chaussy was a stonecutter to trade. In 1905 he was among the founding members of the Seine-et-Marne branch of the SFIO, the French socialist party. In 1911 he became secretary of the trades union federation of Seine-et-Marne. During the First World War he served with the French Army, was promoted to sergeant and received the Croix de guerre 1914–1918. In the 1919 legislative elections he was elected to the French Chamber of Deputies, representing Seine-et-Marne and sitting with the SFIO. Re-elected in the 1924 legislative elections, he was defeated in the 1928 legislative elections, which returned to the old, pre-1919, single vote system. He returned to the chamber in the 1932 legislative elections. During the Second World War, at the special session of the French parliament summoned to grant extraordinary powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain on 10 July 1940 Chaussy was one of the 80 parliamentarians to vote against the measure. He served as mayor of Brie-Comte-Robert from 1929 until his removal by Vichy. Following the liberation of France, Chaussy was again mayor of Brie-Comte-Robert, and served as a conseiller général for the department of Seine-et-Marne. Albert Chaussy died at Melun on 28 December 1945. A school in the town of Brie-Comte-Robert is named for him."

He served as the Chief Minister of Johor from 1982 and 1986 and was later a minister in the federal government of Mahathir Mohamad. He was a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). An economics graduate, Ajib worked as an adviser to Musa Hitam before becoming Chief Minister of Johor in 1982. He served as Chief Minister until 1986, when he moved to federal politics, winning the seat of Mersing. He became a minister in the government of Mahathir Mohamad, but was dismissed in 1987 when Mahathir promptly purged the government cabinet of those who opposed him when they supported, among others, the then Deputy Prime Minister Tun Musa Hitam and Razaleigh Hamzah in the UMNO party presidency election. Ahmad died of a heart attack at the age of 63 on 3 February 2011."

He served as Foreign Affairs Minister in Sulayman al-Nabulsi's government in 1957. A staunch pan-Arabist, Rimawi became one of the most vocal opponents of the Hashemite ruling family in Jordan and favored union with Syria. He fled Jordan in 1957 as the result of a crisis between the leftist government he was a part of and the royal family. He based himself in the United Arab Republic (UAR; result of union between Egypt and Syria in 1958) where he drew closer to UAR President Gamal Abdel Nasser provoking his expulsion from the Ba'ath Party—which was at odds with Nasser—in 1959. Soon after he founded a splinter party called the Arab Socialist Revolutionary Ba'ath Party. During his exile, he allegedly made a number of attempts to attack or undermine the Jordanian monarchy."

He was named chief constable there, serving in that post until 1872, when he was named gold commissioner and stipendiary magistrate for the Kootenay district. In 1873, he was transferred to Omineca in the same position; then, in 1874, he was sent to Cassiar. He resigned his post in autumn of that year. Vowell resigned his seat in the assembly after he was named gold commissioner and stipendiary magistrate for Cassiar. In 1884, he was transferred to Kootenay. Vowell resigned these posts in 1889 after being named superintendent of Indian Affairs for British Columbia, a federal position. In 1898, he was also assigned the duties of Indian Reserve Commissioner after the retirement of Peter O'Reilly. During Vowell's tenure, in 1907, British Columbia rejected the allocation of any additional land to native reserves. Vowell resigned his federal positions in March 1910.

He was born in Edinburgh, the son of Robert Talbot Stenhouse, was educated privately and then attended the University of Edinburgh but failed to qualify for the medical school there. In 1884, he travelled to New York City, continuing on to Vancouver by way of Puget Sound. He settled in the Comox Valley in October 1884, acquiring farmland there. During 1887, Stenhouse converted to the Mormon faith and submitted his resignation from his seat in the assembly in October of that year. He campaigned on behalf of Thomas Basil Humphreys, who replaced him in the assembly. He originally planned to settle in Utah Territory but, in 1888, announced his intent to join a Mormon settlement in the Northwest Territories (present-day southern Alberta) led by Charles Ora Card. Although Stenhouse remained a bachelor, he vigorously defended the right of Mormons to practise polygamy. This in fact led to federal legislation being introduced by Sir John Thompson which declared polygamy to be illegal in Canada. In June 1891, Stenhouse returned to Britain, apparently abandoning the Mormon faith."

  "text" : "Alex M. Torpey (born August 10, 1987 in New York City) is a non-party affiliated American politician and consultant. Torpey was elected as the 48th Village President (equivalent of mayor) of South Orange, New Jersey in May 2011 for a four-year term by a 14-vote margin. At the age of 23 years at the time of being sworn in (May 16, 2011), he was the youngest Village President in South Orange’s history, and at that time the youngest serving mayor in the state of New Jersey. Torpey was one of the youngest mayors in the United States to oversee a municipality the size of South Orange, which has 16,000 full-time residents plus approximately 7,000 Seton Hall University students at their South Orange campus. On June 20, 2014, nearly 1 year before his first term was over, he announced he would not seek re-election to a second term. Torpey's term ended May 18 when he swore-in South Orange's second-youngest, and first female, Village President, Sheena Collum, whom he supported in the election, and had served with for two previous years on South Orange's governing body. Torpey was born in New York City, and raised first in Maplewood, then South Orange, and is an alumnus of Columbia High School (2005). Torpey completed his undergraduate degree in Political Science, American Government and Law at Hampshire College, while also serving as student government president. He also holds a Master of Public Administration in emergency management from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Torpey founded is a managing partner of Veracity Media LLC, a social-impact consulting firm. Torpey also founded a nonpartisan initiative, Rethink Leadership, to help encourage young people to consider elected office and local government as a way to become more involved and active in their government and public policy issues. Torpey was named a 2013-2014 James Madison Fellow at the bi-partisan Millennial Action Project for his work in encouraging young people towards civics participation. Torpey also serves on the advisory board of the New Jersey chapter of the New Leaders Council and on Sustainable Jersey's Community Information and Citizen Engagement Initiative. Starting in the fall semester of 2014, Torpey was appointed adjunct faculty of governance and technology at Seton Hall University, co-teaching with Dr. Matt Hale, master of public administration students on topics of collaboration and technology innovation in government. Torpey’s philosophy of governance relies heavily on the use of technology, media and communications to increase interactivity, transparency and efficiency towards the ends of better government. He has written and lectured on these topics frequently prior to his election and since. While in office, Torpey primarily worked on a number of fiscal, economic development, public safety, transparency, community engagement and organizational development initiatives, in addition to petitioning utility companies for better preparedness efforts after Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy; along with several other New Jersey mayors, performing one of the first legal same-sex marriages in the state in 2013 (as well as being a vocal advocate on the issue); advocating for better open data standards, a tuition-credit program for volunteer first responders and updates to homelessness and veterans support programs. In addition to his official municipal responsibilities as Village President, Torpey served as a member and EMT of the South Orange Rescue Squad. Torpey also served as South Orange's municipal Office of Emergency Management Coordinator."

  "text" : "Albert Arthur Purcell (3 November 1872 – 24 December 1935) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was President of the International Federation of Trade Unions from 1924 to 1928, and sat in the House of Commons in two separate periods between 1923 and 1929. Purcell joined a forerunner of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association in 1891. About the same time, he also joined the Social Democratic Federation. He was elected to Salford Borough Council, serving for six years, then in 1911 became Assistant General Secretary of the union, followed in 1917 by election as General Secretary. Alongside this, he served as Treasurer of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades for three years, then as President. He was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 1921, becoming President of the TUC in 1924. In 1925, he chaired a TUC delegation to the Soviet Union. Purcell was elected at the December 1923 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the city of Coventry, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Sir Edward Manville. However, at the next general election, in October 1924, he was defeated by the Conservative candidate from the 1923 general election. However, Purcell was out of Parliament for only 9 months. James Wignall, the Labour MP for the Forest of Dean division of Gloucestershire, died in June 1925, and at the resulting by-election on 14 July, Purcell won the seat. He did not defend that seat at the 1929 general election, but stood instead in Manchester Moss Side, where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Sir Gerald Berkeley Hurst."

  "text" : "Aaron Reardon is an American Democratic politician and former Snohomish County Executive in Washington State. First elected to the post in 2003, Reardon was sworn in as the youngest serving county executive in America. On February 21, 2013, Reardon announced his resignation effective May 31, 2013. Prior to serving as Snohomish County Executive, Reardon served as a Washington State Senator and a member of the state House of Representatives. He holds a double degree in political science and social science with a focus in public administration and economics from Central Washington University. Reardon is married to Kate Reardon and lives in Everett, Washington with his wife and two children. Reardon attended Mariner High School in Everett and lettered in football, rugby and swimming. His interest in competitive swimming led him to attend Central Washington University, but his swim career ended two months after his arrival - he took a political science course during his first semester and was captivated. He graduated from Central with dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in Economics and Social-Science Public Administration. While at the university, he volunteered on multiple statewide and local Democratic campaigns. His experience running campaigns landed him a paid post-graduate position with the Downtown Seattle Association where he lobbied on behalf of Seattle businesses."

  "text" : "Allen Willard Engel (b. October 20, 1932) is a farmer and former political figure in Saskatchewan, Canada. He represented Notukeu-Willow Bunch from 1971 to 1975 and Assiniboia-Gravelbourg from 1978 to 1986 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a New Democratic Party (NDP) member. He was born in Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan, the son of Emil Engel. Engel studied at the Saskatchewan Teacher's College and taught school for several years. In 1955, he married Joyce Beverly Baumbach of Lodi, California. Engel ran unsuccessfully in the newly created Assiniboia-Gravelbourg riding in 1975 before being elected again in 1978. Engel survived the Progressive Conservative landslide in 1982, almost certainly because Liberal leader Ralph Goodale ran in the riding, turning the contest into a three way race in the process. However, Engel was defeated by Goodale when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1986 and was defeated again by John Thomas Wolfe in a 1988 by-election held after Goodale ran for a federal seat.Engel served as the Legislative Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture from 1978 - 1982, and Agriculture Critic from 1982 - 1986. During his tenure, Engel was instrumental in the preservation of the Grasslands National Park in Southern Saskatchewan, home to some of the world's oldest varieties of virgin prairie. Engel also focussed his efforts on international development including supervising Saskatchewan matching grants for agricultural growth in Africa, and later serving on international development boards. A street in Regina, Saskatchewan was named to honour his service to the province in 2002."

Born in Skien, Telemark, Pracon is the county secretary for the Workers' Youth League, Telemark. In August 2012 Adrian Pracon was sentenced to 180 hours of community service and kr 10,000 in damages having been found guilty by Oslo District Court of aggravated assault against two individuals in November 2011. He had unprovokedly beat the first person, a man, whom he then kicked in the head repeatedly while the man was lying on the ground. A woman also had to have several stitches sewn in her face following the incident. Pracon was given lenience by the court due to the traumas he suffered on July 22, 2011. Pracon had been at an arraignment hearing for Anders Behring Breivik earlier on the day of his offence."

  "text" : "Alfred Mechtersheimer is a former Bundestag member and Neue Rechte politician and author. A former German Air Force colonel and a spokesperson for the far-right Deutschland-Bewegung, Mechtersheimer is known for his protest against Germany's participation in NATO. Mechtersheimer was also a leading figure in the peace movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and among the founders of the ecopax movement. Consequently, Mechtersheimer's political career has seen him move from Bavarian CSU to the Greens in the 1980s. Later he distanced himself from the Greens as well, for their purported lack of patriotism. Afterward Mechtersheimer has organized various movements known for their \"stridently nationalist brand of national pacifism\". His politics since the 1990s have been self-described as \"Nationalpazifismus\" (roughly: national-pacifist)."

  "text" : "Amina Cachalia, OLB (née Asvat; 28 June 1930 – 31 January 2013) was a South African anti-Apartheid activist, women's rights activist, and politician. She was a longtime friend and ally of former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela. Her late husband was political activist Yusuf Cachalia. Cachalia was born Amina Asvat in Vereeniging, South Africa, on 28 June 1930.  She began campaigning against Apartheid and racial discrimination as a teenager. She became a women's rights activist, often focusing on economic issues, such as financial independence for women. Amina and Yusuf Cachalia were friends of Nelson Mandela before his imprisonment at Robben Island in 1962. She became a staunch anti-apartheid activist. She spent fifteen years under house arrest throughout the 1960s and 1970s. She was the treasurer of the Federation of South African Women (Fedsaw), a leading supporter of the Federation of Transvaal Women, and a member of both the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress and Transvaal Indian Congress during the Apartheid era. In 1995 Mandela asked Cachalia to marry him. At the time his was separated from his current wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Cachalia turned down Mandela's proposal because she said that \"I'm my own person and that I had just recently lost my husband whom I had enormous regard for\". Mandela divorced Madikizela-Mandela a year later and married Graça Machel in 1998. Cachalia was elected as an MP to the National Assembly of South Africa in the 1994 South African general election, the country's first with universal adult suffrage. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of Luthuli in Bronze for her contributions to gender and racial equality and democracy. In March 2013, 37 days after her death, her autobiography When Hope and History Rhyme was published."

He was a key figure in the early history of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, being one of its co-founders and a rival to Vladimir Lenin until being expelled in 1909. In the first decade of the Soviet Union, he was an influential opponent of the government from a Marxist perspective. Bogdanov received training in medicine and psychiatry. His scientific interests ranged from the universal systems theory to the possibility of human rejuvenation through blood transfusion. He invented an original philosophy called “tectology,” now regarded as a forerunner of systems theory. He was also an economist, culture theorist, science fiction writer, and political activist."

He ran as the party's candidate in Cardigan in the 1972 federal election, finishing with 14.2 per cent of the vote — which was a historically strong result for the party in the province — and was thus selected as the provincial party's leader later in 1972 following the resignation of David Hall. Ryan led the party to 5.9 per cent of the popular vote in the 1974 provincial election, the first full election in which it competed, but did not succeed in winning any seats. Ryan won 14.6 per cent of the vote in his own riding. In the 1978 provincial election, the party's popular vote declined to 0.9 per cent provincewide, and the party was able to field just five candidates. Due to party infighting, he resigned as leader in 1979."

  "text" : "Andreas Ziartides (Greek: Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης; 1919–1997) was a Cypriot trade unionist and politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1960 to 1991, being elected as a candidate of the left wing AKEL party. He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) from 1943 to 1986. His contribution to the development of labour relations and labour legislation in Cyprus has been crucial and many consider him the person with the most significant role in shaping the trade union movement on the island. Legislations such as the Social Security Law of Cyprus in 1956 (Πρώτος Νόμος Περί Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων, Νόμος Αρ. 31 του 1956), the introduction of the Cost of Living Allowance, the eight-hour working day and the forty hour working week, legislation on unfair dismissal and the labour disputes tribunals, the shaping of the collective agreements in many sectors of economic activity as well as the tripartite cooperation between trade unions, employers’ organisations and government all bear his mark. He first joined the outlawed Communist Party of Cyprus in 1939 and became a member of left wing AKEL party in 1941 upon its foundation.He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Trade Union Committee, the first coordinating body of trade unions in Cyprus and the precursor of PEO. He was accused along with all the Committee members for sedition and insurrection against the Colonial order and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 1946. This was a major political trial of the colonial era and his address to the court was a memorable anti-colonial statement. Andreas Ziartides participated as the Cypriot representative in the founding congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held in 1945 in London. He served on the General Council and the Executive Committee of the WFTU for many years and was its Vice President for a while. In the early nineties he, along with others in the AKEL leadership, disagreed with the line followed by the Party and was dismissed from his leadership position. This led to his and others’ departure from AKEL and the formation of ADESOK, in Greek: ΑΔΗΣΟΚ (Ανανεωτικό Δημοκρατικό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα), a reformist leftist party. ADESOK was later merged with Free Democrats Movement (founded by former President of Cyprus George Vassiliou) and formed a new party named United Democrats. A form of interview/biography of Andreas Ziartides was authored by Panikos Paionides in his book \"Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης: Χωρίς φόβο και πάθος\" Television interviews of Andreas Ziartides were documented by journalist Pavlos Pavlou (Greek: Παύλος Παύλου) in his book Dimosia Katathesi (Greek: Δημόσια Κατάθεση). \n* Special Identity Card of Andreas Ziartides, issued by the House of Representatives on 23/10/1967 (outside). \n* Special Identity Card of Andreas Ziartides, issued by the House of Representatives on 23/10/1967 (inside). \n* Business card of Andreas A.

In his capacity as alderman, he was a successful advocate for the \"macadamizing\" of public roads. In 1914, he owned a Studebaker automobile dealership in Mount Vernon. This business was later named Vernon Heights Garage. As mayor of Melbourne, he recommended to the City Council that they pass an ordinance to regulate the blowing of whistles by the passing railroad. It had been an ongoing source of complaints for many years. He advocated for the creation of a hospital, and contributed his salary and other mayoral fees to create a hospital building fund. After his term, he was appointed a municipal judge. In 1932, he and his son Floyd returned to Mount Vernon and reopened the dealership under the name Vernon Park Motors, Inc."

  "text" : "Alvaro Farinacci (born September 11, 1944) is a Canadian politician. Elected as a municipal councillor for the first time back in 1983, Alvaro Farinacci quickly succeeded in gaining the confidence of the Mayor and Council, as reflected in his appointment to the Executive Committee the following year. Due to his vast experience as a certified real estate broker and member of the Board of Directors of the Montreal Real Estate Board for 17 years, he was entrusted with the responsibility of a number of matters relating to urban development. At the same time, Mr. Farinacci also held various other positions over those years, including chairman of the Commission de l'aménagement du territoire et du développement économique (land use planning and economic development committee), member of the Comité de toponymie (toponymy committee) and, for 16 years, was a member of LaSalle's Comité consultatif d'urbanisme (urban planning advisory committee), where he in fact served as that committee's first chairman. Mr. Farinacci also very significantly contributed to LaSalle's economic growth. He was a founding member of the Corporation de développement économique de LaSalle (CDEL) in 1984 and then served as CDEL's chairman for a number of years. He was also one of the founders of the Comité de sécurité industrielle (committee on safety in the workplace). Recalling that the Mayor had given him the mandate \"to develop a structure designed to arouse interest in order to promote and attract investments to LaSalle\", Alvaro Farinacci mentioned how very proud he was of his contribution to the birth of CDEL, \"which was one of the biggest successes in the history of LaSalle\".From 2001 to 2013, he was a Council member of the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, which greatly benefited from his real estate experience and expertise, entrusting him with the position of vice-chairman of the Commission permanente du logement social (standing committee on social housing). At the present time, he is a member of Ville de Montréal's Commission sur le développement économique et urbain et l'habitation (committee on economic and urban development and housing).A certified real estate agent for 40 years, a businessman actively involved in his community, Alvaro Farinacci has also played a major role in LaSalle's community and cultural life, for instance, as a member of the Board of Directors of Centre culturel Henri-Lemieux and the Fondation de l'Hôpital LaSalle, where he was a Board member and vice-chairman for 25 years."

  "text" : "Avtandil Beridze (Georgian: ავთანდილ ბერიძე; born 11 January 1955) is a Georgian politician. He was elected a chairman of the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara on 28 October 2012. Beridze is a native of Batumi. Formerly a member of the Republican Party of Georgia, he co-founded the public movement Serve to Georgia, in 2011, together with Murman Dumbadze, who had been dismissed from the Republican Party for his opposition to a planned Turkish-Georgian deal on rebuilding of an Ottoman-era mosque in Batumi. Both Dumbadze and Beridze then joined the Georgian Dream party founded by the tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili to challenge Mikheil Saakashvili's United National Movement in the October 2012 parliamentary election. After the Georgian Dream's victory in both nationwide and regional legislative elections in his native Adjara, an autonomous entity on Georgia's Black Sea coast, Beridze was elected the chairman of the Supreme Council of Adjara, being the only candidate nominated for that position on 28 October 2012."

He, along with Ed Marr, hunted, fished and raised onions in a small garden. He started to cultivate citrus, but was impatient and abandoned that project. Canova went to St. Augustine to enlist in the Confederate Army in 1861. In 1885 he wrote Life and Adventures in South Florida, in which he lamented the demise of wildlife in the Indian River area."

Sluysken was born in the Netherlands, and in 1765 became governor of the Dutch trading colony of Surat on the northwest coast of India. He was sent to the Cape in 1793. With his eye on defense in the case of a possible French attack, Sluysken commissioned the construction of a few small forts at Simon's Town in 1794. The following year, the citizens of Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet revolted and declared their independence from the Cape. At the same time British ships attack the Cape, and while Sluysken attempted to defend the colony against invasion, he had to surrender to the British forces on 14 September 1795. He returned to the Netherlands on 12 November. Verhaal gehouden bij den Commissaris van de Caap de Goede Hoop, his account of the events that took place between 10 June and 16 September, was published in 1797. Sluysken died on 18 January 1799."

  "text" : "Abdulkerim Abbas, also Abdul Kerim Abbas, Abdulkerim Abbasoff, 'Abd al-Karīm 'Abbās (1921 – August 27, 1949), was a Uyghur leader in Xinjiang, China during the 20th century. He helped lead the Ili Rebellion of 1944, which led to the founding of the Second East Turkestan Republic (ETR) in northern Xinjiang. Abbas, along with Ehmetjan Qasim, headed the Marxist faction within the ETR, which in 1946 set aside the rebellion's declaration of independence and joined the Nationalist Chinese in forming a coalition provincial government. Qasim and Abbas led the ETR in joining the Chinese Communists toward the end of the Chinese Civil War. They and several other senior leaders of the ETR perished in August 1949 in a plane crash while traveling en route to Beiping (Beijing) where they were invited to participate in the Chinese Communists' political consultative conference, which resulted in the founding of the People's Republic of China. Abbas is officially in hailed in the People's Republic of China as a revolutionary martyr."

  "text" : "Joseph Alfred (Fred) Laberge (February 16, 1893 - March 27, 1964) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario in 1920 and 1921. Laberge was the son of Jean-Baptiste Laberge, who founded the Laberge Lumber Company and constructed many of the earliest buildings in Sudbury. He later took over management of the company from his father. Elected mayor in 1920, Laberge was at 27 years old the youngest mayor ever elected in Sudbury at that point. He was also the first mayor to have been born in Sudbury, and the first francophone to hold the mayoralty since Francis Lemieux in 1903. His election marked at least a temporary end to linguistic tensions between the city's anglophone and francophone communities initiated by the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and ironically occurred just one year after the first municipal election in the city's history in which francophone candidates had failed to win a single seat on council. Following his term as mayor, Laberge ran for the Conservative nomination in Nipissing in the 1925 federal election, but was subjected to a blackmail attempt by Elzéar Cousineau, who wrote him an anonymous letter demanding a $2,000 payout. Laberge turned the letter over to the police, and on their advice left a dummy package in Cousineau's requested location, and Cousineau was arrested when he arrived to retrieve the package. Despite Cousineau's arrest, however, Laberge withdrew from the nomination race in favour of John Ferguson. Ferguson failed on election day to defeat incumbent MP Edmond Lapierre; Laberge was selected as the party's candidate in the subsequent 1926 election, but also lost to Lapierre. After his retirement from the lumber business, Laberge moved to Montreal, Quebec, and died at his home in Westmount on March 27, 1964."

Irwin and his brother Robert Irwin, Jr. were in the mercantile business in Green Bay. In 1827 he married Frances Pamelia Smith, with whom he had seven children. In 1836, he served in the Wisconsin Territorial House of Representatives and then in the Wisconsin Territorial Council. In 1845, he was appointed receiver of the Green Bay Land Office. The position required trips on horseback to Saint Louis, Missouri to deposit funds because there were no banks in Green Bay at the time. His extensive travel duties led to an infection in his arm, which resulted in his death. Irwin died in Green Bay in 1847 while still in office. Elisha Morrow was appointed receiver to fill the vacancy left by Irwin."

  "text" : "Ahmad Razif Abdul Rahman (born 7 November 1965) is the 14th and current Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of the Malaysian state of Terengganu. He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation in Malaysia's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Ahmad Razif, the son of a religious teacher, was raised in Terengganu. He graduated from Universiti Putra Malaysia with a Masters in Science and rose through the ranks of his local UMNO division. In 2008 he was elected to the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the seat of Seberang Takir, defeating a People's Justice Party (PKR) candidate. The State's incoming Chief Minister Ahmad Said appointed him to the State's Executive Council—akin to a cabinet—with responsibility for education, higher education, science, technology and human resources. Ahmad Razif retained his assembly seat at the 2013 election. However, the Barisan Nasional state government almost lost its majority in the assembly, clinging to power with a slim 17–15 majority. In response, the coalition's national leader, and the Prime Minister, Najib Razak, pressured Ahmad Said to resign within a year. In May 2014, Ahmad Said stood down and Ahmad Razif was appointed as his replacement. He was sworn in to office by Mizan Zainal Abidin, the Sultan of Terengganu, on 13 May. Ahmad Razif's first task as Chief Minister was to navigate a political crisis when Ahmad Said and two other UMNO assemblymen resigned from UMNO immediately after his appointment, potentially plunging his government into minority status. Ahmad Said stated that he was dissatisfied that he had not been allowed to remain as Chief Minister until after the wedding of his daughter in May 2014. The three assemblymen returned to the party within days, after the intervention of Najib and other senior Barisan Nasional leaders. On 22 April 2016, his 'Datuk Seri' title had been revoked by the Sultan."

He again served in Cabinet when his party regained power in 1979 under David Tonkin, most notably as Chief Secretary, which included responsibilities for police and prisons. His ministerial term saw him deal with a number of controversial issues, including introduction of random breath testing for South Australian drivers, changes to the operation of prisons in the state, and public concern around police corruption. He resigned from the ministry in 1982 and retired from parliament in 1985."
