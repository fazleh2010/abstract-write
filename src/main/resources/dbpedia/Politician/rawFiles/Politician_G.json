  "text" : "Gus Hall (born Arvo Kustaa Halberg; October 8, 1910 – October 13, 2000) was a leader and chairman of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and its four-time U.S. presidential candidate. As a labor leader, Hall was closely associated with the so-called \"Little Steel\" Strike of 1937, an effort to unionize the nation's smaller, regional steel manufacturers. During the Second Red Scare, Hall was indicted under the Smith Act and was sentenced to eight years in prison. After his release, Hall led the CPUSA for over 40 years, often taking an orthodox Marxist–Leninist stance."

Marius defeated the invading Germanic tribes (the Teutones, Ambrones, and the Cimbri), for which he was called \"the third founder of Rome.\" His life and career were significant in Rome's transformation from Republic to Empire."

An MP from 1945 to 1983, he held office in Harold Wilson's 1964–1970 Labour administration, notably as Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970. As a junior minister at the Wales Office, he was one of the first on the scene of the Aberfan disaster 21st October 1966, although later involved in the controversial government decision to use money from the Aberfan Charity Fund to clear remaining National Coal Board waste tips from around the village. In 1976 Thomas was elected Speaker of the House of Commons, in which role the first broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings brought him unprecedented public attention. He retired from parliament in 1983 and was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Tonypandy, of Rhondda in the County of Mid Glamorgan."

  "text" : "George Lansbury, PC (22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929–31, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women's rights and world disarmament. Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury converted to socialism in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action. In 1912 Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the Poplar \"rates revolt\" of 1921. After his return to parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931 Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but stayed with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the party's leader. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 party conference he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament."

As Viceroy of India, he is noted for the creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam. As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he drew the Curzon Line as the proposed eastern frontier of Poland. He was passed over as Prime Minister in 1923 in favour of Stanley Baldwin. His character polarised opinion amongst his contemporaries, \"sow[ing] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands\". He quarrelled endlessly and his arrogance and inflexibility made even more enemies. Critics have been negative in contrasting his enormous talents and energy on behalf of British imperialism with his mixed results and unrealized ambitions."

  "text" : "Georges-Casimir Dessaulles (September 29, 1827–April 19, 1930), was a Canadian businessman, statesman and senator. Dessaulles holds the record for the oldest serving politician. Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist."

  "text" : "Gary Robichaud (September 13, 1962 – September 8, 2005) was a Canadian teacher and politician, and leader of the Island New Democrats political party in the province of Prince Edward Island. Robichaud was born in Saint John, New Brunswick. He spent his childhood on Prince Edward Island, attending Evangeline Regional High School and then the University of Prince Edward Island. Robichaud began teaching in rural Manitoba, where he met his wife, Jacqueline. In 1995, he moved back to Prince Edward Island to become a high-school teacher in Summerside. For many years, he taught at Three Oaks Senior High School, during which time he helmed Canada's only intramural Reach for the Top league. Joining the Island New Democrats, Robichaud ran unsuccessfully in the 2000 provincial election. In 2002, he ran for the leadership of the party, and won with 62 votes over Ken Bingham with 18 and Deborah Kelly-Hawkes with 4. He was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in late 2003. On June 23, 2005, he announced his resignation as New Democratic leader due to his poor health. He died on September 8, 2005, in Ross Corner. He is survived by his wife, Jaquie, and his daughter, Julia. He was replaced as New Democratic Party leader in 2006 by Dean Constable."

  "text" : "George Murdoch (April 29, 1850 – February 2, 1910) was the first mayor of Calgary, Alberta. He was born in Paisley, Scotland, and died in Calgary, Alberta. Murdoch's family immigrated to Canada in 1854 and settled in Saint John, New Brunswick. He spent much of his earlier years in New Brunswick. Here he married his wife Margaret, and together they had their first two children in the province. In total, they had at least three sons and two daughters. On May 13, 1883, Murdoch moved to Calgary. This was just months before the Canadian Pacific Railway had reached the community in August. In Calgary, he started a successful harness shop. As Calgary was at its early stages, his main clientele were the North-West Mounted Police based in Fort Calgary and Blackfoot Indians who had a reserve nearby. He was on good terms with the Blackfoot, and had learned to speak their language. In the community, Murdoch was involved with the Masonic Lodge and the Orange Order in Canada, literary and history societies, volunteer fire brigade, was one of the founders of Calgary's Presbyterian Church and the first President of the Calgary St. Andrew's Society. Being one of the first permanent businessmen in Calgary, he was an active participant in securing the incorporation of Calgary from the government of the North-West Territories in November 1884. On December 4, 1884, he became the first mayor of the Town of Calgary. He held this post until October 21, 1886. Murdoch was disqualified from the 1886 election after an unsubstantiated allegation was made that he had tampered with votes. Murdoch also served as town Councillor from 1889 to 1890 and city Alderman from 1895 to 1896."

  "text" : "George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579 – 15 April 1632) was an English politician and coloniser. He achieved domestic political success as a Member of Parliament and later Secretary of State under King James I. He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between Prince Charles and the Spanish House of Habsburg royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for his position on the Privy Council and declared his Catholicism publicly. He was created Baron Baltimore in the Irish peerage upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in County Longford, Ireland. The name Baltimore is an Anglicisation of the Irish Baile an Tí Mhóir, which means \"town of the big house.\" Calvert took an interest in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, Sir George looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil, (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert, (1606–1647), was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland."

He was mayor of Glace Bay from 1913 to 1915 when he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force fighting in World War I. He was elected a Conservative MLA in 1925 representing Cape Breton Centre and his support from miners helped ensure the Conservative Party's victory in that election. Harrington became Minister of Labour in the government of Edgar N. Rhodes and became Premier of Nova Scotia when Rhodes left provincial politics to ender the federal cabinet in 1930. During Harrington's term he was able to end ongoing labour disturbance among miners in Cape Breton which had afflicted the previous two premiers. He improved the provincial department of mining, fought for the coal and steel industries in Ottawa, and passed legislation calling for a national policy on coal and steel. However, his government was unable to combat the Great Depression and was defeated by the Liberals in the 1933 election. Harrington remained in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly until 1937. His government was the last Conservative government until Robert Stanfield was able to take power in 1956."

  "text" : "George Edwin King (October 8, 1839 – May 7, 1901) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, second and fourth Premier of New Brunswick, and puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. King was born in Saint John, New Brunswick and attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he received a B.A. in 1859 and a M.A. in 1862. He then served under articles to a senior lawyer in Saint John, Robert Leonard Hazen, was made an attorney in 1863, and was called to the bar in 1865. King was elected to the first provincial legislature of the new Canadian Confederation in 1867 and served in the Confederation Party government as minister without portfolio. When Andrew R. Wetmore resigned, the Confederation Party became the Liberal-Conservatives and King became Premier in 1870. Some members of his caucus felt he was too close to the federal Conservatives of Sir John A. Macdonald and King was maneuvered out of the leadership by George L. Hathaway with King taking a position in the new cabinet. When Hathaway died in 1872, King became Premier for a second time serving until 1878. One of King's major accomplishments was the Common Schools Act of 1871 which implemented a single, tax supported public school system. As Attorney General, King appeared in the courts to defend the Act from constitutional challenges, including appearing before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire, in the case of Maher v. Town Council of Portland, which upheld the Act. In 1880 he became a justice on the province's supreme court, the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, and in 1893 he became a justice on the Supreme Court of Canada. On his death in 1901, he was interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick."

Since, Smriti was only 10th pass, she cleaned tables in the hotel,\" Kamat said . Kamat, who is party affairs in charge of Rajasthan, said this while addressing a public meeting in Pali for upcoming municipal elections in Rajasthan. Born to a cross-cultural family, Irani before finding modelling stardom worked as a waitress at McDonald's.

  "text" : "Gregory Sam \"Greg\" Sorbara, (born September 4, 1946) is former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1995, and again from 2001 to 2012 who represented ridings north of Toronto in the city of Vaughan. Sorbara served as a cabinet minister in the governments of David Peterson and Dalton McGuinty. He resigned from cabinet October 11, 2005, following a police investigation involving his family's real estate development firm and was reinstated on May 23, 2006 after a judge ruled that there was no cause for including Sorbara's name on a search warrant. Sorbara chaired the party's successful 2007 election campaign but announced on October 26, 2007 that he was leaving the cabinet to spend more time with his family but would continue as a backbench MPP. On August 1, 2012, Sorbara announced that he was retiring from the legislature but would stay on as chair of the Liberal's election campaign."

  "text" : "George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration."

  "text" : "George Clift King (April 23, 1848 – July 18, 1935) was the second mayor of the town of Calgary, Alberta. King was born in Chelmsford, England in 1848. At the age of 26, he left England for Canada, arriving in Toronto, Ontario in 1874. He joined the North-West Mounted Police and was part of the first contingent sent west to establish Fort Calgary in 1875. Constable King is often called Calgary's First Citizen, since he was the first NWMP officer to cross the Bow River and set foot on the future site of Calgary. This title is also sometimes given to Sam Livingston, another Calgary pioneer who arrived in the Calgary area in 1874; however, Calgary's first European settler was John Glenn who settled at Fish Creek in 1873. King left the NWMP in 1877 to manage the first store in Calgary, the I. G. Baker Store. In November 1879, he married Louise Munro, the daughter of a fur trader. They were the first couple married in Calgary. Together they had four children. In 1882, King started his own store which also housed the local post office. King was appointed postmaster in 1885 and held this position for 36 years. King was the mayor of the town of Calgary from November 4, 1886, to January 16, 1888. He also spent four years as town councillor. After his retirement as postmaster in 1921, he opened a tobacco and confectionery counter in MacLean's Drug Store on Eighth Avenue. King ran this business until his death in 1935. King was inducted into the Order of the British Empire on January 1, 1934, by King George V. King was laid to rest in Calgary's Union Cemetery. On June 22, 2000, a monument was placed at King's grave and the grave of James Colvin, as they had been unmarked for several years. This was done as part of the 125-year anniversary celebrations of Calgary."

  "text" : "Geert Wilders (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɣeːrt ˈʋɪldərs], born 6 September 1963) is a Dutch politician who is the founder and leader of the Party for Freedom (Partij voor de Vrijheid – PVV). Wilders is the Parliamentary group leader of his party in the Dutch House of Representatives. In the formation in 2010 of the Rutte cabinet, a minority cabinet of VVD and CDA, he actively participated in the negotiations, resulting in a \"support agreement\" (gedoogakkoord) between the PVV and these parties, but withdrew his support in April 2012, citing disagreements with the cabinet on proposed budget cuts. Wilders is best known for his criticism of Islam; his views have made him a controversial figure in the Netherlands and abroad, and since 2004 he receives permanent personal protection by armed bodyguards. Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders left the church at his coming of age. His travels to Israel as a young adult, as well as to neighbouring Arab countries, helped form his political views. Wilders worked as a speechwriter for the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie – VVD), and later served as parliamentary assistant to party leader Frits Bolkestein from 1990 to 1998. He was elected to the Utrecht city council in 1996, and later to the House of Representatives. Citing irreconcilable differences over the party's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, he left the VVD in 2004 to form his own party, the Party for Freedom. Wilders has campaigned to stop what he views as the \"Islamisation of the Netherlands\". He has compared the Quran to Mein Kampf and has campaigned to have the book banned in the Netherlands. He advocates ending immigration from Muslim countries, and supports banning the construction of new mosques. Wilders was a speaker at the Facing Jihad Conference held in Jerusalem in 2008, which discussed the dangers of jihad, and has called for a hard line against what he called the \"street terror\" exerted by minorities in Dutch cities. His controversial 2008 film about his views on Islam, Fitna, received international attention. He has been described in the media as populist and labeled far-right, although this is disputed by other observers. Wilders, who long refused to align himself with European far-right leaders such as Jean-Marie Le Pen and Jörg Haider and expressed concern of being \"linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups\", views himself as a right-wing liberal. More recently, however, Wilders worked together with the French National Front's Marine Le Pen in a failed attempt to form a parliamentary group in the European Parliament which would also have included Austria's Freedom Party, Italy's Northern League, and Belgium's Flemish Interest. On 18 March 2016, his trial began on the accusation of inciting \"discrimination and hatred\" against Moroccans living in the Netherlands."

  "text" : "Geraldine \"Gerri\" Whittington (September 11, 1931 – January 24, 1993) was the personal executive secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was the first African-American secretary in the White House. Johnson was famous for working long hours and insisting his assistants worked long hours as well. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson became president, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Whittington working in a government office, and requested that his \"special assistant\" Jack Valenti get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening, and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson's phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke, but came to believe that it really was the president on the line. She applied for the job and was offered the position. Having a black woman in the White House was very unusual in the early 1960s. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he'd hired a black woman, but chose not to call a news conference. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on the television game show \"What's My Line?\", wherein contestants attempted to guess her profession. This may have seemed less overt, but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held. Whittington appeared on episode #696 of the game show What's My Line? on January 19, 1964. She was the first contestant. The mystery guest that evening was Van Heflin and the panel consisted of Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf. After Whittington signed the blackboard as \"Jerri Whittington,\" she told host John Daly that she was from West River, Maryland. Whittington's occupation was shown on the screen as \"Secretary to President Johnson.\" After her game, she described President Lyndon Johnson with the following words, \"great warmth, fair, kind, a perfectionist.\" Later Whittington appeared in several magazines, including Jet and Sepia. She was the first person to learn that Justice Thurgood Marshall had been nominated by President Johnson to the Supreme Court. Minutes before LBJ made the official announcement, he took his nominee down to her office and said, \"Here's the next Supreme Court Justice!\" She told friends that she thanked the President for making the choice of the first Black court justice. After suffering a stroke at age 38, Ms. Whittington died of cancer in Washington, DC, on January 24, 1993, on the same day as Justice Thurgood Marshall."

  "text" : "Georg Dertinger (25 December 1902 – 21 January 1968) was a German politician from the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). He was born in Berlin into a middle-class Protestant family. Dertinger briefly studied law and economics. After his study he became a journalist and later editor for the Magdeburger Volkszeitung and the nationalistic newspaper Stahlhelm. He broke with the Stahlhelm because of its rigid right-wing philosophy. He sympathized with the German National People's Party, a right-wing nationalist party. Dertinger later became a member of the political circle around Chancellor Franz von Papen. He accompanied Papen to Rome as a journalist, a representative for the Hamburger Nachrichten, for the signature of the Concordat between Germany and the Holy See, shortly after Hitler became Chancellor. In 1934 Dertinger returned to Berlin and became publisher of Dienst aus Deutschland, a news agency that provided news to foreign newspapers. After World War II Dertinger co-founded the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the SBZ (Soviet Occupied Zone) of Germany. From 1946 to 1949 he was General Secretary of the East-German CDU and from 1949 to 1953 Vice-Chairman of the party. He supported the official line of co-operation with the Socialist Unity Party and opposed the more independent-minded party chairman Jakob Kaiser, whom he had deposed in December, 1947. Dertinger also joined the Cultural Association of the DDR (Kulturbund) and was a member of the Cultural Association's Presidential Council. On 11 October 1949 he became East Germany's first Minister of Foreign Affairs in Otto Grotewohl's cabinet  and in 1950 he signed the Oder-Neisse Treaty with Poland, that arranged the borderline between East Germany and the Polish People's Republic. On 15 January 1953  Dertinger was arrested and in 1954 he was tried on a show trial for espionage, found guilty and sentenced to hard labor (15 years). In 1964 he was given amnesty. The years before his death he worked for the Roman Catholic St. Benno publishing house."

  "text" : "Grace Hartman OOnt (1900 – May 23, 1998), née Armstrong was a social activist and politician in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, who became the city's first female mayor. She became mayor on October 18, 1966  when she was selected by city council following the death of the city's previous mayor, Max Silverman. However, in the municipal elections the following year, Hartman was defeated when the city's popular longtime mayor Joe Fabbro, Silverman's predecessor, stood for election again. Hartman had previously campaigned for mayor in 1956, losing to Fabbro. In addition to the distinction of being the first woman to serve as mayor in the City of Sudbury, Hartman also shares the distinction with Dr. Faustina Kelly Cook of being one of the first women to serve on Sudbury City Council. They were both elected to Sudbury City Council on December 4, 1950. She served on council until 1954, when she was elected the city's comptroller. Hartman was also a president of the Ontario Municipal Association, a board member of the Royal Ontario Museum, and a chair of several social service and community organizations in Sudbury. She was born in Markdale, Ontario, and moved to Sudbury after marrying George Hartman in 1938. George Hartman died in 1960; Grace subsequently married Arthur Grout in 1969. In 1975, Hartman was named one of the 25 leading women of Ontario. In the late 1970s, Hartman and Grout retired to Toronto, although Hartman returned to Sudbury several times, to accept an honorary doctorate from Laurentian University and a lifetime achievement award from the city's business and professional women's association. Hartman died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto on May 23, 1998. In 2001, the outdoor amphitheatre at the city's Bell Park, the site of the annual Northern Lights Festival Boréal, was named the Grace Hartman Amphitheatre in her memory. Creating the amphitheatre had been one of Hartman's key projects during her city council term."

Following the defeat Chambers resigned and was succeeded as PNM leader by Patrick Manning."

A teacher by profession he ran for mayor of the township in 1978 but lost to David Bartlett. Brooks remained a councillor and defeated Bartlett in a 1985 rematch. In 1991 Brooks was defeated by local businessman James Stewart, whom Brooks had defeated in his 1988 reelection. Brooks was nominated as the Reform Party candidate for the riding of Nepean—Carleton, but in March 1997 he resigned due to conflicts with the riding association before the election. Later that year he defeated Stewart to regain the mayoralty. Brooks was a strong opponent of the amalgamation of Rideau Township into the city of Ottawa, but once the new city was created he chose to run for the role of Rideau's representative to the city. The race again pitted Brooks against Stewart. Brooks won by a substantial margin and was reelected by approximately the same margin in the 2003 Ottawa election against Paul Paton. In the 2006 election Brooks was challenged by Scott Moffatt, but was reelected. In the 2010 election Moffat again challenged Brooks, and this time won by a substantial margin."

  "text" : "Gerry Altobello is a former city councillor in Toronto, Canada. He represented Scarborough Southwest. Altobello first entered politics in 1985 when he was elected to the council of Scarborough to represent Ward 2, defeating more left-leaning candidate Barry Boyle. At 27, he was the youngest member on the council. He was re-elected with ease in 1988, but in 1991 he faced a fierce election battle against businessman Danny Lovatsis. Nevertheless, he was re-elected. He opposed the amalgamation of Scarborough, Toronto, and four other municipalities in 1997, but after it occurred he ran for a seat on Toronto city council in Ward 13. The ward structure at the time was such that the two candidates who received the most votes were elected in each riding. He was elected along with Brian Ashton. Fellow Scarborough city councillor Fred Johnson came in third. He has chaired the Planning and Transportation Committee. A centrist, he was aligned with the Liberal Party. On June 9, 2006, he was appointed a justice of the peace by the Attorney General of Ontario Michael Bryant, effective June 21, 2006. On June 14, 2006, he resigned as a councillor."

He originally rose to prominence for his work with the Save the Rouge group fighting to keep the Rouge Valley area of Scarborough free from development. A strong environmentalist, De Baeremaeker is a vegan. Working as an assistant to city councillor Doug Mahood, De Baeremaeker ran for a seat on Scarborough city council in 1994 but lost to David Soknacki. Continuing his environmental work, De Baeremaeker became one of the leaders in the effort to save the Oak Ridges Moraine from development. When Brad Duguid left city council in 2003 to run for the provincial Liberals, De Baeremaeker decided to run for the empty seat and triumphed by a wide margin. De Baeremaeker is notable for cycling to City Hall from his home in Scarborough almost every day year round. He is a strong advocate for safer road conditions for cyclists. De Baeremaeker is also known for his support of former Mayor David Miller's policies, in particular his support of the civic workers' deal to end the 2009 Toronto municipal strike."

This order was suspended, and the initial judgement was overturned on appeal. Mammoliti re-joined the executive committee in October 2013. Previously, Mammoliti served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995. In 2002, he switched names from the anglicized George to the Italian Giorgio. On October 15, 2009, he declared his candidacy for mayor in Toronto's 2010 election. In July, after registering no more than 4% in public opinion polls over several months, Mammoliti withdrew from the mayoral contest in order to stand for re-election as a city councillor. On July 9, 2014, Toronto City Council suspended Mammoliti for three months for holding fundraisers contrary to the Council's code of conduct. On September 15, police have launched an investigation into the matter."

  "text" : "Ghulam Azam (Bengali: গোলাম আযম; 7 November 1922 – 23 October 2014) was a Bangladeshi politician convicted of war crimes. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, he led the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, which opposed the independence of Bangladesh and together with the Pakistani military establishment, perpetrated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and was instrumental in the 1971 killing of Bengali intellectuals. He led the party until 2000. On 15 July 2013, a Bangladeshi special tribunal (the International Crimes Tribunal) found Azam guilty of war crimes such as conspiring, planning, incitement to and complicity in committing genocide, and gave him a 90-year prison sentence. e tribunal stated that Azam deserved capital punishment for his activity during Liberation war of Bangladesh but was given a lenient punishment of imprisonment because of his age and health condition. The trial has been criticized by several international observers, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Human Rights Watch, which was initially supportive of a trial subsequently criticized its \"strong judicial bias towards the prosecution and grave violations of due process rights\", calling the trial process deeply flawed and unable to meet international fair trial standards. Notably, it was at the center of the 2012 ICT Skype controversy. As a leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, he led the formation of the Shanti Committees which were formed at the time of the Liberation War alongside other pro-Pakistan Bengali leaders. Azam was accused of forming paramilitary groups for the Pakistani Army, including Razakars, and Al-Badr. These militias opposed the Mukti Bahini members who fought for the independence of Bangladesh, and also stand accused of war crimes.Azam's citizenship of Bangladesh had been cancelled by the Bangladeshi Government because of his role during the Bangladesh Liberation War. He lived in Bangladesh illegally without any authorised Bangladeshi visa from 1978 to 1994, when the Bangladesh Supreme Court reinstated his citizenship. Azam was arrested on 11 January 2012 on the charges of committing war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War by the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh. The tribunal rejected the plea of bail after noting that there were formal charges against Azam of which it had taken cognisance. He died of a stroke on 23 October 2014 at BSMMU at the age of 91."

  "text" : "George Leonard (November 1742 – April 1, 1826) was a Canadian farmer from New Brunswick who served as alderman and chamberlain of Saint John. George was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the son of Nathaniel Leonard and Priscilla Rogers. He became a merchant in Boston and married Sarah Thatcher there in 1765. During the American Revolutionary War, he was a Loyalist and commanded a fleet of ships which raided coastal towns in 1779. He took his family to Canada when the British evacuated Boston in 1775. He settled in Parrtown (later Saint John) in 1783. In 1786, he was named superintendent of trade and fisheries at Canso, Nova Scotia. He served as a member of the Council for New Brunswick, serving until his death at Sussex Vale at the age of 83. He was also lieutenant colonel for the Kings County militia and quartermaster for the provincial militia. He founded the Masonic lodge at Saint John. His son George was a member of the provincial assembly."

  "text" : "Gary Glen Mar QC, (simplified Chinese: 马健威; traditional Chinese: 馬健威; pinyin: Mǎ Jiànwēi; born July 26, 1962) is a former Canadian politician in Alberta, Canada.Gary Mar was appointed as the Province of Alberta’s Representative in Asia on October 14, 2011. He led the province’s strategic outreach efforts from his post in Hong Kong, from where he oversaw the province’s five other Asia offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul and Taiwan. After more than 20 years as an Alberta politician and government official, Gary Mar’s public sector career came to an end on June 30, 2015, when his contract as Alberta’s representative in Asia expired, amid criticism of the former provincial Progressive Conservative administration’s payout of $140,000 as part of a contract it signed with Mar in December 2011. Mar had served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1993 to 2007 and prior to his diplomatic postings held several Cabinet portfolios – Community Development; Health and Wellness; Education; Environment; and International and Intergovernmental Relations. On December 3, 2007, he was appointed the Official Representative for Alberta in Washington, D.C., and worked in the Canadian Embassy with the official title of Minister-Counsellor of the Province of Alberta to the United States. In March 2011, he resigned his post in order to seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta in its 2011 leadership election which he ultimately lost."

  "text" : "Gerald Joseph Doucet (born May 4, 1937) is a Canadian politician and lobbyist. He represented the electoral district of Richmond in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1963 to 1974, as a Progressive Conservative. Born in Grand Étang, Nova Scotia in 1937, Doucet graduated from St. Francis Xavier University in 1958, and went on to earn a law degree from Dalhousie University in 1961. Doucet was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1963 general election, defeating Liberal leader Earl Urquhart by 83 votes in the Richmond riding. He was re-elected in 1967 and 1970. He served in the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Provincial Secretary, and Minister of Education. When appointed in 1964, Doucet was the first Acadian cabinet minister in the provinces history. He ran for leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia at the party's 1971 leadership convention, finishing second to John Buchanan. Starting in 1984, Doucet was a member of the successful but sometimes controversial Ottawa consulting firm Government Consultants International (GCI), along with Frank Moores, Francis Fox, and Gary Ouellet (The Insiders, by John Sawatsky, 1987; On The Take, by Stevie Cameron, 1994). In 2004 he published his biography, \"Acadian Footprints\". He is the brother of Fred Doucet, who served as Brian Mulroney's first Chief of Staff when he became leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party in 1983, and served on his staff in the Prime Minister's Office while Mulroney was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993."

Washington was elected to the Twentieth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-second Congresses, serving three terms from March 4, 1827 until March 3, 1833. In Congress, he served as chairman of the Committee on District of Columbia during the Twenty-second Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1832, but was elected two years later as an Anti-Jacksonian to the Twenty-fourth Congress, serving one term from March 4, 1835 to March 3, 1837. He was again not a candidate for renomination. After his service in Congress, Washington became president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company. He was also appointed by President John Tyler in 1844 as a commissioner to adjust and settle the claims arising under the treaty of 1835 with the Cherokee Indians. In 1852, he was nominated by the Native American Party as a candidate for Vice President on a ticket with Daniel Webster.

  "text" : "Godert Alexander Gerard Philip, Baron van der Capellen (December 15, 1778 – April 10, 1848) was a Dutch statesman from Utrecht. Van der Capellen was the son of a cavalry colonel. He was made Prefect of Friesland in 1808 and soon thereafter Minister of the Interior and a member of the Privy Council. At his advice, King Louis Napoleon abdicated the throne in 1810 in favor of his son, Louis II. Van der Capellen did not serve Napoleon I. Wilhelm I, King of the Netherlands, appointed him Colonial Minister and sent him as Secretary of United Kingdom of the Netherlands to Brussels. In 1815, van de Capellen was made the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, where he had to deal with both a native rebellion and a money shortage. In fact, during his tenure in Java, his power was largely ceremonial as his adjunct, Cornelis Theodorus Elout, had much of the actual power. The King decreed freedom of cultivation and trade, and the slave trade was prohibited. Van der Capellen was less progressive than other commissioners; after they left in 1819, he increased the power of native chiefs. He protected the Government’s system of coffee plantations by not allowing European planters to settle in the Priangan area of West Java, nor would he let Europeans or Chinese trade there. In 1824 he cancelled contracts of land tenancy, forcing the native chiefs to pay back the advances they had received by further exploiting the cultivators. This caused unrest in Yogyakarta. As the post-war boom in coffee and sugar exports faded, Javanese ports went into deficit. Money was spent quelling riots outside of Java in Maluku (Moluccas), Kalimantan (Borneo), Sulawesi (Celebes), Palembang, and on the west coast of Sumatra. Van der Capellen made a tour in 1824 and abolished the hated limit on the number of spice trees. Muntinghe’s proposal for a national company under King Willem was adopted in 1825 as the Netherlands Trading Society with 37,000,000 guilders in capital and paying 4.5 percent dividends. Hard-pressed cultivators had to pay taxes in money and turned to Chinese moneylenders. He was ordered back in 1825 and named President of the Board of Trustees of the University of Utrecht in 1828. In 1838, he attended the coronation of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in London as the Dutch envoy. Van der Capellen then served as the Lord Chamberlain of King William II. He died in April 1848 in De Bilt."

Aghazadeh served as the Vice President for Atomic Energy of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran up until July 2009. He has a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Computer Engineering from University of Tehran. He moved to the US for further studies but returned in late 1978 as the revolution against the Shah began to unfold. He was an active member of the opposition, and in 1979 became a director of the ultra-populist IRP newspaper Jomhouri Eslami, run by Mir-Hossein Mousavi. In 1980, Mousavi became foreign minister and made Aghazadeh his deputy in charge of economic relations and finance. Two years later, as Mousavi became prime minister, Aghazadeh was made state minister for executive affairs, a post attached to the prime minister's office. Later he held the title of deputy prime minister for executive affairs in charge of Iran's oil barter deals with foreign states and companies under a countertrade system started in 1982. He co-ordinated policies of various ministries through the PM's office. His talents earned him the post of Iran's Minister of Petroleum in October 1985. He held this position until 1997 when he was replaced by Bijan Namdar Zanganeh after the election of then reformist president Mohammad Khatami. He was then promoted to the post of Vice President for Atomic Energy. He held this position from 1997 to 2009. Aghazadeh is also a member of the Expediency Discernment Council. On 16 July 2009, the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency reported that Gholam Reza Aghazadeh had resigned as Iran's Nuclear Chief for unspecified reasons, a resignation of intense interest in such a difficult time."

Gu Yong (168–243), courtesy name Yuantan, was a minister of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He learnt the classics and calligraphy from Cai Yong when the latter came to Wu briefly as a refugee. His family is one of the four illustrious houses of Wu (Zhu, Lu, Gu, Zhang). He became a governor of several prefectures throughout Yang Province. He was successful in pacify and integrate rebels and minorities under his jurisdiction. When Sun Quan became the 'King of Wu', he bestowed the title of \"Marquis of Yangsui District\" (陽遂鄉侯) on Gu Yong. After Sun Quan declared himself 'Emperor' and established Wu in 229, Gu Yong was appointed as the chancellor. Gu Yong was said to be a reticent person and a teetotaler, famous for his standards of personal conduct; whenever he spoke, however, he spoke with confidence and reason. He was also known for keeping silent when he disagreed with something; this was a major reason why the emperor often tested his ideas on Gu Yong to see what Gu thought of the concepts — if Gu Yong refused to comment Sun Quan would realise something had not been thought through. Gu Yong was a very modest person who did not repay his enemies with malice but always did everything according to the law."

  "text" : "Greg Byrne, Q.C. (born April 14, 1960 in Harvey, New Brunswick) is a lawyer and former MLA in the province of New Brunswick, Canada. Byrne was educated at Fredericton High School, Saint Thomas University (where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1984) and the University of New Brunswick (where he received a Bachelor of Laws in 1987). A Liberal, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1995 provincial election. He joined the cabinet of Frank McKenna in 1997 as junior minister responsible for mines and energy. He resigned from cabinet in 1998 in order to run in the leadership convention to replace McKenna who had resigned later in 1997. Byrne finished second to Camille Thériault at the convention. Thériault named Byrne to his cabinet in the more senior roles of Attorney General of New Brunswick and Government House Leader. Like many of his Liberal colleagues, Byrne fell victim to the massive Progressive Conservative sweep in the 1999 election, losing his seat by only 264 votes. In 2002, he co-chaired the successful leadership bid of Shawn Graham to succeed Thériault. In 2003, he was elected president of the New Brunswick Liberals and he was re-elected in 2005. Byrne ran and won the riding of Fredericton-Lincoln running as a Liberal candidate in the 2006 election. Following the election, he was returned to the cabinet as Minister of Business New Brunswick and stepped down as president of the party."

Seitz migrated to Australia with his family in 1956, and became a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1971. In 1982, he was elected to represent the Keilor district. He served as Labor's whip while the party was in Opposition during the 1990s. On 13 May 2006, The Age newspaper in Melbourne published two articles alleging Seitz had been involved in branch stacking within his electorate, using the proceeds of community bingo games and a rental apartment to pay for memberships to the Labor Party. It was alleged that Seitz used his influence within the ALP to secure 2007 pre-selection for prominent Labor Right faction leader Bill Shorten to run for Federal Parliament (Seitz is a member of the Labor Unity faction, within Labor Right), and in return a Shorten-led party administrative committee allowed Seitz to continue serving in Victorian Parliament past the usual retirement age of 65. Former Victorian Premier John Cain said of Seitz, \"His parliamentary career is eminently forgettable. I think the most I can say is that he was a backbench warrior who was out there in the local electorate doing a lot of branch-stacking and enjoying it.\" Seitz has denied The Age's allegations. He died in 2015."

Pillitteri is a member of the Liberal party who first bid for the Niagara Falls electoral district in 1988. He lost to Conservative candidate Rob Nicholson in that election by a narrow margin of only 1,940 votes. After a second attempt in the 1993 general election, he defeated Nicholson by 10,823 votes and joined the federal Parliament and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. He therefore served in the 35th, 36th and 37th Canadian Parliaments. Pillitteri is currently the longest serving consecutive Member of Parliament the Niagara Falls riding has ever had. Pillitteri left federal politics in 2004 and did not seek a fourth term in federal office. Rob Nicholson decided to put his name forward to run as the Conservative candidate in the next election only once he learned that Pillitteri had retired. Nicholson regained the riding that year."

  "text" : "Georgios Kountouriotis (Greek: Γεώργιος Κουντουριώτης) (1782–1858) was a Greek ship-owner and politician who served as prime minister from March to October 1848. He was born in 1782 on the Saronic island of Hydra to an Arvanite family. He was the brother of Lazaros Kountouriotis, another ship-owner of the Greek War of Independence and grandfather of Pavlos Kountouriotis who fought in the First Balkan War and later served as first President of the Greek Republic. When the War of Independence broke out, Georgios, along with the rest of the Kountouriotis family, supported the effort with generous donations as well as with their ships. He was often at odds with other Hydriot sea captains, but ultimately was the wealthiest. Georgios Kountouriotis became a member of the executive committee of the Greek Revolution and served as its President from 1823 to 1826 during the crucial time of the siege of Missolonghi. After independence, he became a member of the cabinet of Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor of Greece. He was a semi-independent adherent of the French Party mostly due to his antipathy to the Russian Party and his fellow Hydriots of the English Party. During the period of French Party ascendancy in the reign of King Otto, he served as Prime Minister. He died in 1858."

However, in the February 1974 general election, Wilson gained the seat by 2,966 votes, thus ending Machin's tenure as an MP of just 11 months. Machin attempted unsuccessfully to regain his seat in the October 1974 election but then retired from politics."

  "text" : "Gerrit Hendrik Kersten (6 August 1882, Deventer – 6 September 1948, Waarde) was a Dutch Christian minister and politician. In 1907, Kersten founded the Reformed Congregations (Dutch: Gereformeerde Gemeenten). Eleven years later, in 1918, he had established the Reformed Political Party (Dutch: Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij) to realize his vision of \"a Calvinist Netherlands without cinema, sports, vaccination and social security\". He was the party's first member of the House of Representatives, being elected in 1922. He would remain in parliament until 1945. On the evening of 10 November 1925, Kersten, staunchly opposed to Roman Catholicism, proposed an amendment to the 1926 budget for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Kersten's proposal came down to ending financial support for a Dutch office at the Holy See. The amendment was adopted the next day, with support from government party Christian Historical Union. This led to the resignation of four Catholic government ministers and the fall of the first government of Hendrik Colijn. The fall of the cabinet became known as the Night of Kersten. Kersten was a staunch critic of the policies of Colijn. The speaker of the Dutch parliament had parts of Kersten's contributions to debates edited in the Proceedings no less than thirteen times between 1922 and 1940. Kersten feared the rise of fascism and national socialism in the inter-war period, but saw fascism's authoritarian tendencies as a positive aspect and kept seeing socialism and Catholicism as greater evils. During the Second World War, Kersten denounced resistance against the Nazis, claiming they were sent by God as punishment for desecration of the Lord's Day (Sunday). He also refused to sign a 1941 protest of the Convent of Dutch Churches (Dutch: Convent der Kerken) against the persecution of Jews during the war, and even went as far as to seek the Nazis help to keep his paper, Banier, in business. After the end of the war, a government committee branded him a collaborator and barred him from Parliament. He focussed on writing theological works. Kersten died three years later, in 1948."

In Clement Attlee's post-war government, he served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1945 to 1950, and was made a Privy Councillor in 1947.

  "text" : "Khwaja Ghulam Ahmad Ashai (Arabic: غولم أحمد أشي) was a Kashmiri bureaucrat and political leader. He was the grandson of Rayees-ul-Waqt Hajji Mukhthar Shah Ashai. The 'Ashai Bagh Bridge' over Nigeen Lake and Dal Lake is named after Ashai's ancestors. Before moving to suburban Srinagar, the Ashais lived at the 'Ashai Kocha' in Fateh Kadal, Srinagar. The historic Ashai mansion now hosts a Girl's high school. Ashai's hut in Raj Bagh has been converted into a hotel. Popularly known as Ashai Sahib by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree. In reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities. In the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai’s contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road. A commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\"."

  "text" : "Graham Addley (born 1963) is a Canadian provincial politician. He was the New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for the constituency of Saskatoon Sutherland until he was defeated in the 2007 election by the Saskatchewan Party's Joceline Schriemer. Addley was first elected to the Legislature in 1999, and served as Deputy Speaker and chair of the Committee of the Whole from May 2001 to October 2005. He co-authored \"Press Councils and Democracy\" which he presented to the 41st Canadian Regional Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in New Brunswick in July 2002 and was subsequently published in the Parliamentary Review. Appointed in 2000 to the All Party Committee on Tobacco Control, Addley was instrumental in developing recommendations which transformed Saskatchewan's approach to tobacco control including the precedent setting tobacco display ban which eliminated the last legal avenue for tobacco companies to advertise to children. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 in Saskatchewan's favour, the law was emulated across the country and around the world. In 2006 the Lung Association of Saskatchewan presented Addley its Award of Merit for outstanding service in promoting lung health in Saskatchewan. Appointed Legislative Secretary to the Premier on Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment in January 2005, his \"Healthy Choices in a Healthy Community Report\" resulted in the Premier's Project Hope strategy which was honoured by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) for leadership and commitment to the field of addiction. In October 2005 Addley was appointed to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Healthy Living Services and Minister Responsible for Seniors. In May 2007 his Cabinet duties were expanded to include Minister Responsible for Investment Saskatchewan Inc. and Minister Responsible for Information Services Corporation of Saskatchewan. He is married with three children."

  "text" : "Giancarlo Pagliarini (born April 23, 1942) is an Italian politician. Born in Milan, he was later elected to the Italian Senate for Lega Nord in 1992 and re-elected in 1994, then elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1996 and in 2001. He was Minister of the Budget in Berlusconi I Cabinet in 1994, \"President of Padania\" in 1996 and floor leader of Lega Nord in the Chamber of Deputies from 1999 to 2001. He is married to a lady of Armenian origin whose family survived the Armenian Genocide, they have a son and a daughter. Before joining the League, Pagliarini worked as accountant and was close to the Radical Party, for its battle in favour of divorce. Anyway, he never joined that party, being only a voter, and so he made his first political experience in the League. Pagliarini is a moderate, sometimes dissenting with the party's social-conservative agenda, a libertarian, especially on economic issues, and a prominent supporter of fiscal federalism and fiscal conservatism. He was known as maverick politician and, prior to leaving Lega Nord, often criticized the line imposed by Umberto Bossi. Lately he dissented with the continuation of the alliance with the other House of Freedoms parties, favouring an autonomous path for the League, and flirted with the independentist wing of the party, led by Gilberto Oneto, a libertarian himself, and maintained relations with the Liberal Reformers. On 19 January 2007 Pagliarini, who was not candidate for re-election in the 2006 general election, finally left Lega Nord. In June he took part to the libertarian network founded by Daniele Capezzone. On 18 January 2008 he unexepectedly joined The Right of Francesco Storace and then was candidated in Lombardy in the 2008 general election, despite declaring to be \"leghista in the soul and the mind\". He wasn't elected. He was candidated as mayor of Milan for local elections 2011, but he wasn't able to enter the runoff election.Currently he's member of Act to Stop the Decline, a federalist and liberal party."

He was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Hemsworth at a by-election in 1934 following the death of the sitting MP Gabriel Price of South Elmsall. Mr Absalom Flavell, of South Kirkby, had been recommended by a number of affiliated bodies for selection as prospective Labour candidate, but he voluntarily withdrew in favour of Mr Griffiths, who had a stronger backing, having been secretary and organiser of the Hemsworth Divisional Labour Party since 1917 when the constituency was created.. Griffiths held the seat at the next two general elections, and died in office in 1945. He was born in North Wales and started work in a coal mine when 13 years of age and was to move to Royston in 1903 where he was employed at the Monckton Colliery to progress to checkweighman. He became delegate for the Monckton Colliery branch to the Yorkshire Miners' Association in 1911 and was also a representative of the Barnsley area on the Miners' Welfare Committee. He also had a long record of public service as a member of the Royston Urban District and Council, being chairman several times. He was also a member of the West Riding County Council and served on the Public Health committee, Highways committee, Law and Parliamentary committee, Public Assistance committee and the West Riding Rivers Board."

Rocheleau was born in Hull, Quebec, he was a businessman by career. His post-secondary education was at the University of Ottawa. He became a city councillor in 1967, then mayor from 1974 to 1981. He was elected as a member of the National Assembly of Quebec in 1981 in Hull as a member of the Liberal Party of Quebec. He was again elected to the Assembly in 1985 and became a cabinet minister in Premier Robert Bourassa's administration. He left provincial politics to campaign in the 1988 federal election in the Hull—Aylmer electoral district for the national Liberal party. He served in the 34th Canadian Parliament until he left the party on 2 July 1990 following the implosion of the Meech Lake Accord. After several months as an independent, he became a charter member of the Bloc Québécois party on 20 December 1990. However, Rocheleau's embrace of Quebec sovereigntism didn't play well in his strongly federalist riding, and he was heavily defeated by Liberal candidate Marcel Massé in the 1993 federal election. He was married twice: to Denise Gagné in 1956 and then later to Hélène Roy. Rocheleau died in Hull at the age of 62."

  "text" : "George Dallas (6 August 1878 – 4 January 1961) was a British Labour Party politician. Born in Glasgow, Dallas worked as a coal miner in his youth. He joined the Socialist League in about 1894 before moving to London to work for a coal merchant. Returning to Glasgow, he participated in the trade union movement and a variety of jobs before becoming the Secretary of the Independent Labour Party in Scotland from 1908 until 1912. In 1912, Dallas moved back to London to work as the organiser of the National Federation of Women Workers, but soon moved to the Workers' Union. In 1917, he was appointed to the Agricultural Wages Board. In 1922, he moved to the newly built Welwyn Garden City. At the 1918 and 1922 general elections, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Maldon constituency in Essex, coming a distant second on each occasion, with 39.6% and 27.8% of the votes respectively. He was unsuccessful again at the 1923 general election in Scottish constituency of Roxburgh and Selkirk, coming third with 26% of the votes. Dallas did not contest the 1924 general election. However, at the 1929 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for the marginal seat of Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, after the sitting Labour MP William Cove moved to the safe Labour seat of Aberavon in Wales. When the Labour Party split at the 1931 general election, he lost his seat with a swing of 16.6% to the Conservative candidate Archibald James, who had criticized Dallas' views on the crisis. After his loss, Dallas was appointed to several Government committees set to investigate agricultural and water problems. In 1935, he visited European centres where international gatherings of Labour representatives have taken place to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Dallas stood again in Wellingborough at the 1935 general election again, cutting the Conservative majority to 372 votes. However, he resigned his candidacy a few months later, partly due to illness. However, he continued his activities for the Labour Party, and was elected chairman of the National Executive Committee in 1937. He died in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire aged 82."

He went to Trinity College, Cambridge to study law and was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1932. He was a member of the Territorial branch of the Royal Artillery and during the Second World War he was a Staff member at the Corps' headquarters. At the end of the war Wills fought Bridgwater as a Conservative candidate, but could not gain the seat from Vernon Bartlett who had won it as an 'Independent Progressive' in a 1938 byelection. He returned to the Bar, but at the 1950 general election, Wills was successful. He was appointed an Assistant Government Whip in 1952, and was promoted to be Lord Commissioner of the Treasury in October 1954. He retained this position under Anthony Eden. When Harold Macmillan became Prime Minister, he appointed Wills as Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household (third highest in the Whip's Office). Wills left office in October 1958, being Knighted to mark his service. Wills died in office in October 1969."

  "text" : "Greg J. Curtis (born October 18, 1960) is a Lobbyist and Attorney from Utah. He is married to Teresa Curtis and the father of six children and eight grandchildren. A Republican, he is a former member of the Utah State House. He formerly represented the state's 49th house district in Sandy and Cottonwood Heights. He formerly served as the Speaker of the House. Curtis was first elected to the State Legislature in 1994, defeating a fellow Republican in the primary. Curtis grew up in his district in Sandy and served a two-year LDS mission to New Zealand. He has worked for a private law firm; as a prosecutor for West Jordan City; and as staff counsel for County Mayor Nancy Workman. Curtis graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in accounting and then received a law degree from the University of Utah. Beginning in October 2008, Curtis was plagued by accusations from several former state employees who claimed that Curtis abused his government position to benefit his legal clients financially. One of these former employees, Doug Clark, claimed that Curtis cut funding and caused layoffs to anyone who opposed his plans to build a public transit facility in the midst of an ancient Native American settlement in Draper, Utah. Changing the location of the proposed facility would have kept land owners in the area from moving forward with subsequent development plans. Clark said that Curtis told him, *“Doug, I am the speaker of the House. If I want something, I get it. ... I want you to talk to DNR to figure out a way to get that road through there. I know this may sound a little strange. You may think it is unethical — because it probably is — because effectively I’m asking you as a state employee to work for me and do work for my law client.” On November 4, 2008, Curtis became the first sitting Speaker of the House in Utah to fail to win re-election in 40 years. Democrat Jay Seegmiller won by over 10% - nearly 1,400 votes. With this result, it became apparent that the public was fed up with Curtis's alleged abuse of power. For the 2009 legislative session, Curtis returned to Utah's Capitol Hill - not as a state representative - but as a lobbyist representing several large companies, including Intermountain Healthcare, UTA, Altria Group, parent company of Philip Morris."

After World War II in which he served as a decorated airman with RAF Bomber Command, Mackie took over a farm at Benshie, Angus, and subsequently set up a cattle ranch at Braeroy, Inverness-shire, near Spean Bridge. Having first contested South Angus in 1959, he was elected Member of Parliament for Caithness and Sutherland in 1964. In the Commons he served as Scottish Liberal whip. He lost his seat in 1966, when he was defeated by Labour candidate Robert Maclennan. Maclennan eventually became a senior Social Democrat Party/Liberal Democrat politician in the 1980s. Mackie contested Caithness and Sutherland again in 1970, but lost by a wider margin. Having been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1971, he was given a life peerage, as Baron Mackie of Benshie, of Kirriemuir in the County of Angus on 10 May 1974. In the House of Lords, he served as Agriculture and Scottish Affairs spokesman for the Liberals and their successor parties between 1975 and 2000. Having been Chair of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1965 to 1970, he was its President between 1983 and 1988. In 1980, he was elected to serve a term as Rector of the University of Dundee. His older brothers were Sir Maitland Mackie and John Mackie, Baron John-Mackie. Until his death, Mackie was the oldest living person to have served as a Liberal Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. His death was announced on 17 February 2015. He was 95 years old."

Davie, also a future Premier, who sought to win a seat in the House via the Cariboo byelection but who unlike Cowan did not have the advantages of Walkem's influence and support in the Cariboo riding (Davie would seek election successfully in the Lillooet riding in the subsequent general election of 1878). Cowan was re-elected consistently until retiring before the 1890 election. He was born June 25, 1831 in Leeds County, Ontario, where his father was a farmer. At the age of 20, he went to the gold rush in Australia and worked in hardrock and placer mining for seven years, but returned to Ontario in 1859. In 1862, he heard news of the Cariboo Gold Rush and set out for British Columbia, arriving in Victoria in June. He mined successfully on Williams, Grouse and Antler Creeks but continued investment in mining depleted his resources. A Presbyterian, he was also a supporter of the government of John A. Macdonald federally, though there were no party alignments in British Columbia politics in his era."

  "text" : "Gustaf Herman Danielson (1883 – July 1971) was a Canadian provincial politician. He was born in Sweden, immigrated to the United States in 1901, and then to Saskatchewan in 1904. In Saskatchewan he homesteaded south of Elbow. He was active in many organizations: he was a Saskatchewan Wheat Pool delegate, served on the board of the Davidson Co-operative Association for more than forty years, was elected to Rural Municipality council for fifteen years, the last eight as reeve, the school board for seven years, and the Davidson Hospital Board for thirty-eight years. He was elected as the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for the constituency of Arm River, from 1934 until 1964, serving seven terms. In 1938, he defeated Conservative leader and future Prime Minister of Canada John Diefenbaker. In 1944 he was one of only five Liberals to be elected. As representative of the Arm River riding, he was preceded by Conservative Duncan Selby Hutcheon and followed by the first leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, Martin Peder Pederson. While his thirty years in the Legislature makes him its longest-serving member, his defeat in 1964 was ironic in that it was the election which saw the Liberals return to power after twenty years in opposition. Danielson Provincial Park (located near Saskatchewan's Lake Diefenbaker and Gardiner Dam) was named after him."

  "text" : "George Frederick Muntz (26 November 1794 – 30 July 1857) was an industrialist from Birmingham, England and a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for the Birmingham constituency from 1840 until his death. His family came to England during the French revolution. As an industrialist, he developed Muntz Metal. Muntz was a supporter of political reform and a member of the Birmingham Political Union. In his actions that led to the Reform Act of 1832, he was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold: To stop the Duke, run for gold. He also was involved in a riot at Saint Martins in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838, but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming to be a republican, his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. Edwards wrote in 1877 of a conversation about a speech he made: \"They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim.\" \"Why not?\" said I. \"Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's enough\". His home was at Umberslade Hall, in Tanworth in Arden. In the grounds of his estate, Muntz's son commissioned a church to be built which stands to this day, Umberslade Baptist Church. His descendants still live in the area and operate Umberslade Hall Children's Farm. He had seven sons and two daughters. The family business was continued by the eldest son, George Frederick junior together with Philip Albert Muntz, also a Member of Parliament who was created a Baronet in 1902 (see Muntz Baronets). George's brother, Philip Henry Muntz, was also an MP. One son, William Henry Muntz, designed a new type of paddle wheel. The Muntz family are remembered by Muntz Street, a tower block called Muntz House and Muntz Park, all in Birmingham."

  "text" : "Georges-Paul Wagner (26 February 1921 - 11 June 2006) was a French lawyer, monarchist and deputy of the far-right National Front (FN). He was first an activist of the Action française (AF) monarchist movement, and then participated in 1971 to the creation of the Nouvelle Action française (NAF) along with Bertrand Renouvin. Opposed to the NAF's policies in the name of the hard-wing, he distanced himself from it in 1974. Wagner was elected deputy of the Yvelines during the French legislative elections in 1986, under the colours of the Rassemblement national which gathered members of the National Front and candidates supported by Jean-Marie Le Pen's party. Wagner was not reelected in 1988. He founded in October 1986 the Institut d'Histoire et de Politique along with Roland Hélie and Philippe Colombani, a formation center of the National Front. He has published books criticizing parliamentarism, and another one named \"The trial of Maurras.\" Georges-Paul Wagner participated to Présent, a far-right review linked to the FN. He has defended in court Jean-Marie Le Pen, as well as members of the OAS terrorist movement who tried to assassinate General Charles de Gaulle at Le Petit-Clamart in 1962. He obtained the acquittement of Michel-Georges Micberth in the affair of the Pompidou's checks. He succeeded in June 2001 to the historian Pierre Chaumeil at the head of the Association professionnelle de la presse monarchiste française (Professional Association of French Monarchist Press), created in 1882. He died on June 11, 2006."

  "text" : "George Henry Bennett (1850 Buckie, Banffshire, Scotland – 8 September 1908 Richmond, Victoria, Australia) was a brewer and a politician. Bennett emigrated to Australia in 1855. He managed the Victoria Sugar Co. and later, with a partner, owned Excelsior Brewery, a porterbrewing business. Excelsior Brewery operated in Collingwood and Richmond. As larger brewers took over the local market, Excelsior moved to manufacturing aerated waters and cordials at Richmond. He took over sole control of the company from August 1883. In 1880 Bennett was elected to the Richmond town council and, in turn, was elected Mayor in 1886. As Mayor he was also elected as the second President of the fledgling Richmond Football Club, commencing with the 1887 season. He held this post for the next twenty-two years until his death. During his tenure the club won its first two Victorian Football Association premierships and gained admittance to the more powerful Victorian Football League. A liberal and protectionist, he was elected to the seat of Richmond in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1889 and was then re-elected at the next seven elections. Bennett died of pneumonia at his home on 8 September 1908. He was survived by his wife, Jessie, and two of their three daughters. His bust stands outside the Richmond Town Hall."

  "text" : "George Washington Logan (February 22, 1815 – October 18, 1889) was a prominent North Carolina politician who served in the Confederate States Congress during the American Civil War as a peace and Unionist candidate. Logan was born in Rutherford County, North Carolina. He served as Clerk of County Court (1841-1849), County Solicitor (1855-1856), member of the Confederate Congress (1863-1865), delegate from Rutherford County to the State Convention (1865) and Brigadier General of the Division of North Carolina Troops. Elected to serve in the Second Confederate Congress from 1864 to 1865 \"for the two-fold purpose of opposing tyranny and keeping out of the rebel army,\" Logan was a Unionist and opponent of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He was thought to be involved in the Red Strings, a Unionist movement within the Confederacy. After the Civil War he served in the North Carolina State Legislature from 1866 to 1868 as a member of the Republican Party and served as a Superior Court Judge (1868-1874). As a Judge, he was a foe of the Ku Klux Klan and in 1874 Judge Logan was defeated by one of his enemies David Schenck, a member of the Klan. As a native white member of the Reconstruction Republican Party, Logan was known as a \"scalawag\", but was strongly opposed to the policies (and possible corruption) enacted by Governor William Woods Holden. In State v. Reinhardt and Love (1869), Judge Logan ordered a verdict of \"not guilty\" for a case involving Alexander Reinhardt, a \"person of color\" and Alice Love, a white woman, despite North Carolina's Marriage Act of 1838 banning interracial marriage. The George W. Logan House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. In 1866, he purchased the property now known as Pine Gables and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999."

The corps included infantry, mounted infantry and artillery divisions and was authorized with the name City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV). It proceeded to South Africa in the early months of 1900, returned in October the same year, and was disbanded in December 1900. Major McMicking was appointed in charge of Field Battery (the artillery division) of the CIV on 1 January 1900, with the temporary rank of Major in the Army, and left London for South Africa in early February with a contingent of officers and men of the Honourable Artillery Company.

Hagel is widely seen as losing his seat in the legislature due to a cover-up in the NDP caucus. He was elected mayor of Moose Jaw in the Saskatchewan municipal elections, 2009, and retired in 2012, deciding not to run for another term."

He graduated as physician in Rio de Janeiro in 1889 and was one of the most affluent Brazilian physicians of his time. In December 1891, the government of the state of Espirito Santo suffered an intervention by the Partido Republicano Construtor (Builder's Republican Party), due to the resignation of the legal governor Alfeu Adolfo Monjardim de Andrade e Almeida, who abandoned the office in protest against the coup d'état of November 23, 1891 that led the Marshall Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca to resign the presidency of Brazil in favour of his vice-president Marshall Floriano Peixoto, who had aspirations to become a de facto ruler. Inácio Henrique de Gouveia, Graciano dos Santos Neves and Galdino Teixeira de Barros Loreto were appointed by the Builder's Republican Party to take the charge as provisional administrators of the state until the election, by the people, of a new president (governor). This one was José de Melo Carvalho Muniz Freire, elected governor in early 1892. Four years later, on May 23, 1896, Graciano dos Santos Neves returned to the office of governor of Espirito Santo, this time as an elected governor. However, he resigned the office on September 23, 1897, due to his disappointment with politics. He wrote a book called A Doutrina do Engrossamento (The Doctrine on Getting Tougher) which was an essay on the flattering among politicians with self-promotion purposes, and on how much it is emotionally disappointing, based on his experience as interventor and governor of Espirito Santo. Later in his life, Graciano dos Santos Neves became the director of the Botanic Garden of Rio de Janeiro."

At the outbreak of World War I, he was rejected for service in the First Australian Imperial Force and did civilian war work instead. He and his younger brother Jack—who also became a federal politician, as did his son, John—set up as accountants and agents and eventually became wholesale and retail merchants. In October 1924, he married Marcia Doreen Weston."

  "text" : "Gordon St. Angelo (June 20, 1927 - October 18, 2011) born in Huntingburg, Indiana, USA is former Democratic Party State Chairman of the state of Indiana and was a prominent politician during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Gordon was born on June 20, 1927 to George and Lillian (Salat) St. Angelo in Huntingburg, Indiana. He served in the Navy at the end of World War II. He then attended North Central College, where he was active in student politics. He there met his future wife Beatrice Mae Larson, who was from Watertown, South Dakota. Gordon became active in Democratic Party politics in 1954. He was elected Dubois County Chairman in 1958. An early key supporter of then Senator John F. Kennedy, he became 8th District Chairman in 1960. St. Angelo worked on two presidential campaigns including holding the position of National Co-Chairman of Humphrey for President Committee. He was also manager of Roger Branigin's successful campaign for the governorship of Indiana in 1964. After managing the campaign of Governor Roger D. Branigan in 1964, Gordon was elected state Democratic Party Chairman, a position he held until 1974. His tenure was longer than that of any party chairman in Indiana. From 1974 to 1996, he was Vice-President of Community Development for the Lilly Endowment, and during this time was a vocal proponent for the development of free market economies in North and South America. Gordon's political reach extended beyond the state. He was Deputy Democratic Party National Chairman from June to November, 1968, when he helped manage the Hubert Humphrey presidential campaign. In 1974 Gordon left politics to become Senior Program Officer of community development at the Lilly Endowment, where he loved working for twenty three years. There he was instrumental in expanding the role of non-profits in public policy, with many positive civil- and individual-rights implications. His building of coalitions between non-profit think tanks was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1973, he ran for National Democratic Party chairman, being narrowly defeated by Larry O'Brien. Gordon also served on the boards of the University of Indianapolis (1965-1993), St. Meinrad College, WFYI, the United Way, the Welfare Service League, the State Employment Commission, the Indiana Division of the National Civil Rights Commission, and the Indianapolis 500 Festival Committee. Starting with his work at the Lilly Endowment, Gordon and Beatty took special interest in historic New Harmony, Indiana which they visited often. He was appointed by Governor Evan Bayh to the New Harmony Commission and served on the board of the Robert Lee Blaffer Foundation until his death (Chairman, 1995-2006). He received honorary doctorates from the University of Indianapolis and the University of Southern Indiana. He received \"Sagamore of the Wabash\" awards for his service to Indiana from Governors Welsh, Branigan, Whitcomb, Bowen, Orr, Bayh and Daniels. In 1996, St. Angelo helped create a foundation with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose Friedman to promote and help establish educational choice in America. He served as President & CEO of the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation for School Choice until 2009. He was succeeded by Robert Enlow. Though he started his career in the Democratic party, he was a supporter of many Republican candidates since the mid-seventies. For example, he endorsed Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, a Republican, for both of his gubernatorial campaigns. St. Angelo died on October 18, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana."

His brother Sidney James and his nephew Maarten would follow his father in business life, while George pursued an academic career. He was a lawyer in Amsterdam, 1915–1936. From 1925–33 he was a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands. He was author of Astronomy for the millions and The universe in space and time, which were translated into English in 1937. During the 1950s he studied the longer eclipse cycles, allowing him to predict solar and lunar eclipses over a long time interval. This was published in 1955 as Periodicity and Variation of Solar (and Lunar) Eclipses. In 1958 he developed a compressed form of typesetting called Hoofdletters, published asHoofdletters, Tweeling- en Meerlingdruk. The crater Van den Bergh on the Moon is named after him."

He was considered the ancestor of the imperial house of Li of the Tang dynasty, which honoured him as Emperor Deming (德明皇帝). He is cited admonishing his king: \"Heaven can see and hear, and does so through the eyes and ears of the people; Heaven rewards the virtuous and punishes the wicked, and does it through the people.\" This admonition does not promote a democratic idea; it conforms to the Confucian principle of humane actions. Some Chinese scholars have argued he is the same person as Ye the Great, said by Sima Qian to have been the father of Fei the Great who was later known as Boyi. Ye was reckoned as one of the ancestors of the House of Ying in the Qin and of the ruling house of Zhao. Gao Yao is sometimes considered the father of Boyi."

  "text" : "Garrett Michael Hayes (born February 10, 1956) is a U.S. politician from Georgia. He was the Libertarian Party of Georgia's candidate for governor in both 2002 and 2006. He was born in California to screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Mildred \"Mel\" (née Hicks) Hayes. Garrett was raised in Maine and moved back to California in 1969, where he later attended Beverly Hills High School and California State College at Bakersfield. He moved to Georgia in 1991 and currently serves as the secretary of the Cobb County Libertarian Party. After serving in a number of roles with the both county and state Libertarian organizations in Georgia, Hayes sought and won the party nomination for governor in 2002 and again in 2006. Hayes received 2.3% of the vote in 2003 and 3.8% of the vote in 2006. In his second run at office, Hayes set several benchmarks for third party politics in the state, beginning with being the first Libertarian to run twice for governor. Hayes’s campaign was the first Libertarian gubernatorial campaign to produce and run television advertisements in Georgia. He also garnered the highest polling numbers to date for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in the state, polling as high as 9% in one non-partisan poll, leading to press speculation that Hayes might force an unprecedented runoff electionbetween incumbent Republican Sonny Perdue and Democratic rival Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Though a runoff did not in fact result, Hayes still gathered both the highest number and the highest percentage of votes for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in Georgia. Hayes currently co-hosts a weekly Libertarian-themed political radio talk show on radio station WHIE in Griffin, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta."

He represented King's County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1882 to 1886 as a Liberal-Conservative member. Born in Clifton, the son of William P. Flewelling he married, in 1863, Augusta Whelpley. Flewelling was also a captain in the local militia and an auditor for King's County. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1878 and was first elected in an 1882 by-election held after the death of John Herbert Crawford. In 1886, he was named to the Legislative Council. Some historians have said he had roots in Wales, where his family may have immigrated from. In fact, the Flewelling's/Flewwelling's had not been in Wales for at least three centuries before his birth, and Gabriel's great grandfather (Enos Flewelling) and great-great grandfather (Thomas Flewelling) were Loyalists in the American Revolution, from what was then North Castle, Westchester Co., New York. He died on May 9, 1922."

  "text" : "Grace Tully (9 August 1900 – 15 June 1984) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). Grace Tully was born on 9 August 1900 in Bayonne, New Jersey. Her father was a businessman and a loyalist to the Democratic Party. He died when she was young, and Tully and her two sisters and brother were raised by their mother. She received her secretarial education at the Grace Institute in New York, and after graduating was appointed as secretary to Patrick Hayes, bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. In 1928, Grace Tully started to work for the Democratic National Committee, and was assigned to assist Eleanor Roosevelt, who was organizing support for presidential nominee Al Smith. Later that year, when FDR was nominated for Governor of New York, Grace Tully went to work on his staff. After Roosevelt's successful election, Tully began serving as the assistant to Missy LeHand, who was Roosevelt's personal secretary in Roosevelt's office at Albany, New York. Tully was given the dictation and typing duties that Lehand disliked. Tully served with FDR for his four years as governor. Grace Tully moved to Washington, D.C., in 1933, when Roosevelt was elected President. Both she and Missy LeHand were important figures for FDR during his presidency. Tully frequently accompanied FDR on his trips to Hyde Park and Shangri-La (today called Camp David). When Missy LeHand suffered a stroke in 1941, Grace Tully took over her position as personal secretary to the President. Tully was not an intimate or romantic companion for Roosevelt in the same way as LeHand had been. She continued working for the President until his death in April 1945 at his \"Little White House\" in Warm Springs, where she was present as he died. Then she served as the Executive Secretary for the FDR Foundation. In 1949 she published her memoirs, FDR: My Boss. In 1955 she joined the staff of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, working with Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time. She retired ten years later and died in 1984."

He was found guilty in March 2014 of abuse of authority and is currently economic attaché at the Argentinian embassy in Rome. A 2011 Financial Times (FT) article stated that Moreno was widely viewed as “Argentina’s de facto economy minister.” Moreno, wrote the Infobae news website in 2013, “is the man who drives the economy of Argentina.” He was also described during his cabinet tenure as “the person most reviled by businesses – good and bad alike – in Argentina.” At the time of his resignation, Bloomberg News described Moreno as “the most feared government official” who had spent eight years “controlling prices and imports using strong-arm tactics that earned him a reputation as a bully.” Mercopress, in 2010, called him “a controversial but all-powerful thug-style figure from the Kirchner bunker.”"

During the U.S. Presidential election of 2016 he has been the only Arizona Republican to have held high office to endorse the Democratic candidate for President, Hillary Clinton. Regarding the two Presidential candidates, Donald Trump (Republican) and Hillary Clinton (Democrat) he wrote, “Hillary Clinton is one of the most qualified nominees to ever run for president. Donald Trump is the least qualified ever. The stakes are too high to stand on the sideline. I stand with Hillary Clinton for president.” Woods, considered a moderate-to-liberal Republican, was attorney general from 1991 to 1999. In the 1980s, Woods was the first congressional chief of staff for now-U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and is a longtime friend and confidant of McCain's. McCain is supporting Trump as the Republican Party's presidential nominee."

  "text" : "George Davy Kelley (1848 – December 18, 1911) was a British trades unionist and Labour politician. Kelley was born in Ruskington, Lincolnshire in 1848. He became apprenticed to the lithographic printing trade in York. Following his apprenticeship, he worked as a printer in London, Birmingham, Leeds and Bradford. He moved to Manchester to become general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers, formed in 1880. Kelley was an early proponent of the Labour movement putting forward candidates for election. He became vice-president of the Labour Electoral Association in 1889, and presided at the Labour Electoral Congress held in Hanley in 1890. He was elected to the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress in 1892. He held the office of secretary of a number of bodies: the Manchester Trades and Labour Council, the Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Trade Councils, the Manchester and District Board of Conciliation and the National Printing and Kindred Trades Federation. In 1902 he travelled to New York as part of Alfred Moseley's Commission of Inquiry into the organisation of Labour. Two years later as vice-chairman of the National Committee of Organised Labour, he campaigned for the introduction of a universal old age pension. At the 1906 general election he was selected as one of the Labour Representation Committee candidates, and was elected as Member of Parliament for Manchester South West, unseating the sitting Conservative MP. Due to ill-health he retired from parliament at the next general election in January 1910. He died in Manchester in December 1911, aged 63."

  "text" : "Gordon Price is a Canadian urban planner and a former politician, who was an NPA member of Vancouver City Council, serving six terms from 1986 to 2002. He was the first openly gay member of Vancouver City Council. Since retiring from politics, Price writes, teaches and consults on urban development and planning issues. Price first became prominent when he organized a campaign involving citizen street patrols against street prostitution in his West End Vancouver neighbourhood. As a politician, he also served on the board of the Greater Vancouver Regional District (Metro Vancouver) and the board of TransLink. After retiring from politics, Price became a writer and public lecturer on urban renewal and transportation planning issues. He writes a column for the magazine Business in Vancouver. He is currently director of the CITY Program, a continuing education program in urban planning and sustainable community development at Simon Fraser University. In 2009, he was appointed by Gregor Robertson, the Mayor of Vancouver, to the city's \"Greenest City Action Team\"."

Ludolfavailed himself largely of his younger brother's (Otto) splendid businesstalents, and the two might, indeed, have succeeded at the time in tiding overthis most critical epoch in the constitutional history of the land, had theynot had to encounter the deep insincerity of the monarch on the one side,and the (very excusable) profound distrust of the Radical and Progressistmajority of the Assembly on the other side. Both Ludolf and Otto Camphausen were moderate Liberals —too honestly Liberalto suit the views of the king and of the reactionary feudalist cliquearound him, and too honestly Conservative for the impatience of the menof progress. Less than three short months sufficed to convince LudolfCamphausen of this fact, and already on 20 June he tenderedhis resignation to the king. One month after, at the end of July, 1848,Ludolf Camphausen was sent as Prussian representative to the Frankfurt Parliament. Here he remained till April, 1849,when he finally resigned, and went back to his banking business at Cologne,a wiser and sadder man, thoroughly disenchanted of the alluring illusions ofpower and office."

He was appointed Minister for Mines and Energy in September 2006 by Peter Beattie, and continued in that post after Anna Bligh took over as Premier a year later. Following the 2009 election, he was named Minister for Education and Training. In the February 2011 reshuffle, he was appointed Minister for Health. He served in that post until Anna Bligh resigned following Labor's loss at 2012 election, in which Wilson lost his seat."

  "text" : "George Downie Blyth Crookston Hardie (8 September 1873 – 26 July 1937) was a Scottish Labour politician, and the younger brother of the party's founder Keir Hardie. After leaving school, he became an engineer and an activist in the Independent Labour Party. He first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1918 general election, when he unsuccessfully contested the Glasgow Springburn constituency for the Labour Party. He won the Springburn seat with a large majority at the 1922 general election, helped by the absence of a Liberal Party candidate. He was re-elected at the next three general elections, but when Labour's vote collapsed at the 1931 general election, Hardie was one of those who lost his seat — by a majority of only 34 votes, the left-wing vote having been divided by the presence of a Communist Party candidate. Hardie was re-elected with a large majority at the 1935 general election, and died in office two years later, aged 63."

He joined his father's lumber business, eventually becoming a partner. He married Gertrude Cochrane in 1923. During the mayoral campaign, Zimmermann travelled to New York City and Washington, D.C. and secured almost $6,000,000 worth of construction to be financed with federal funds for the Fillmore-Lovejoy sewer project and Kensington High School. He was elected mayor on November 8, 1933, as the Democratic candidate. On April 18, 1936, formal charges were filed against Zimmermann to Governor Herbert H. Lehman charging 20 alleged counts of official misconduct. Included were Zimmermann's part in the sewage disposal project and the reported \"deal\" with former Mayor Schwab. A grand jury indicted him. On May 1, 1936 he was arraigned, and returned to work the following day. After his term he returned to private life. He was once again indicted on March 14, 1938, by a grand jury related to his alleged activity regarding Buffalo 's $15,000,000 sewer project. A New York Supreme Court jury returned guilty verdicts on six of the nine counts charged against him. While awaiting the decision from his appeal, he died on September 14, 1938, and was buried in Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Cheektowaga, New York."

The Gam brothers were close associates of Alluri Sitarama Raju during his tribal fights, attacking the police stations of Krishna Devi Peta, Addateegala and Annavaram and procuring ammunition for their assault missions. However, he was an alcoholic and womaniser. During these bouts, he provided secret information about their activities to the British. Hence, he was dismissed from the village by Raju. He took shelter in the house of his lover in 1923. During this time, the British arrested him and prosecuted him with the death sentence. On his appeal, the death sentence was changed in 1924 to life imprisonment at Andaman Jail. He was released in 1937 on the perusal of Congress politicians. In this way, he became the only associate of Raju to survive the British assault. He was elected to the 1st Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam constituency in 1952 as Independent candidate along with Lanka Sundaram."

  "text" : "Gerrit Jan van Heuven Goedhart (March 19, 1901 – July 8, 1956) was a Dutch politician and diplomat. He was the first United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (1951–1956). Van Heuven Goedhart studied Law at Leiden University and graduated in 1926. The year before, he had already become a reporter for newspaper De Telegraaf. On January 1, 1930, at the age of 28, he was promoted to editor in chief. He was fired on June 1, 1933, because he refused to publish an article that called the newly elected German leader Adolf Hitler \"a great statesman\". He became editor in chief of regional newspaper Utrechts Nieuwsblad, where he would stay in office until the German invasion of the Netherlands. During the Second World War, Van Heuven Goedhart worked as a reporter and editor in chief for the illegal resistance newspaper Het Parool. In 1944 he fled to London, where he was appointed Minister of Justice in the government in exile. After the Second World War, Van Heuven Goedhart returned to Het Parool, where he once again become editor in chief. In 1947, he also became Senator for the Labour Party. In 1951, he gave up both occupations to become the first High Commissioner for Refugees of the United Nations. Under Van Heuven Goedhart, the UNHCR was awarded the 1954 Nobel Peace Prize. Van Heuven Goedhart was also the first chairman of the \"state committee for the coordination of government information\" (Dutch: Staatscommissie over de coördinatie van de overheidsvoorlichting), the predecessor of the Netherlands Government Information Service (Dutch: Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst)."

His contributions to social life included providing the land for the Whitehouse and Grange Bowling club in 1872 and acting as president of the Edinburgh Chess Club from 1884 to 1885. In 1885 Harrison was elected Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South. However he died at the age of 74 within 5 days of the election's closure (18 December), and never took his seat. He is buried in Warriston Cemetery just to the south-east of the vaults. In 1888 the Harrison Arch was built \"to commemorate the work and character of Sir George Harrison\". It is a red sandstone triumphal arch. Two streets in Edinburgh — Harrison Road, and Harrison Gardens — were also named after him."

Adams was born at a time when all the original mutineers apart from his own father had been killed, or in the case of Ned Young died of natural causes. In 1808 the Pitcairn colony was discovered and the elder Adams was granted amnesty for his part in the mutiny. Both of Adams' parents died in March 1829, when George was 24 years old. Adams served as Chief Magistrate on Pitcairn in 1848. Adams was an opponent of Joshua Hill, and he opposed the decision to move to Norfolk Island, due to his granddaughter being ill. Adams did eventually move, and died on Norfolk Island in 1873."

  "text" : "George Andrew Leslie (born 21 November 1936) is a Scottish nationalist politician. Leslie studied at Hillhead High School and Glasgow University before becoming a vet. He joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the early 1960s, and was selected to stand for the party at the Glasgow Pollok by-election, 1967. During the by-election one observer described his speeches as being in the style of Jimmy Maxton. His campaign also featured the singing of both traditional and topical Scottish songs. Although the party had never previously contested the seat, Leslie took 28% of the vote. The Labour Party share of the vote dropped considerably, enabling the Conservative Party to win - their last by-election gain of the century in Scotland. Leslie's campaign marked the start of a year of successes for the SNP, including becoming the largest party in local government in Stirling, and victory in the Hamilton by-election. Leslie was soon elected to the Glasgow Corporation, and, in 1969, became the SNP's Senior Vice-Chairman. Later, he served as a Strathclyde Regional councillor forEast Kilbride, and he stood as the SNP candidate for Glasgow at the European Parliament election in 1979, taking 16.4% of the vote. During the early 1980s, Leslie was the SNP's Vice-Chairman for Policy. He was the party's candidate in the high-profile Glasgow Hillhead by-election in 1982 but, despite campaigning hard, he was only able to take fourth place, with 11.3% of the votes cast. He stood again in Hillhead at the 1983 general election, but fell to only 5.4% of the vote, He stood in Strathclyde East at the 1984 European election, taking second place with 17.6% of the vote, then in Kilmarnock and Loudoun in the 1987 general election, taking third place but 18.2%. Standing again in Strathclyde East at the 1989 European election, he increased his share to 25.2%, and finally at the 1992 general election he took 15.6% and fourth place in Glasgow Pollok. On 28 February 2010, Leslie formally launched a campaign to contest Kilmarnock and Loudoun at the 2010 general election. However, he finished in second place, 12,378 votes behind the Labour Party candidate Cathy Jamieson. Leslie currently remains an active member of the SNP in the Kilmarnock & Loudoun area."

  "text" : "Gordon Howard \"Paddy\" Fitzgerald (January 19, 1927 – May 1, 2014) was a Canadian politician in the province of Nova Scotia. He was a former Speaker of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Fitzgerald was born in Cochrane, Ontario. A lawyer by profession, Fitzgerald was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1960 provincial election representing Halifax Northwest for the Progressive Conservative and was re-elected in 1963. In 1967 he was elected in the new riding of Halifax Cobequid. In 1969, he was appointed Speaker and served until the 1970 provincial election in which the Conservative government was defeated and Fitzgerald lost his seat. Following his defeat, Fitzgerald returned to his legal practice and was one of the province's top trial lawyers in the 1970s. In 1978, he was convicted for falsifying tax return forms, and was disbarred by the Nova Scotia Bar Association for fraud. In 1980, he was convicted of raping a female client in his office and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He was paroled in 1981 after serving ten months of his sentence and was pardoned in 1992. In 1982, Fitzgerald was awarded a five-month $15,000 contract by the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission to study proposed changes to the Liquor Control Act. The appointment was met with outrage by the Opposition in the House of Assembly and he resigned the appointment. Fitzgerald attempted a political comeback in the 1993 provincial election and contested the Progressive Conservative nomination in Dartmouth South to run against Liberal leader John Savage. He won the nomination by a margin of 29 votes to 25 votes for his opponent, Dartmouth city councillor Colin May but Conservative Premier Donald Cameron refused to sign Fitzgerald's nomination papers due to Fitzgerald's rape conviction. May was awarded the nomination instead. Fitzgerald died on May 1, 2014 at a hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, aged 87."

He was elected at the 1945 general election as MP for Rossendale, at the age of 70, becoming one of only a handful of first-time MPs in their seventies. There is some possibility that he was the oldest ever first-time MP elected at a general election, but there is some uncertainty about his exact date of birth and that of a few other elderly MPs. Walker did not stand again at the 1950 general election, when the Rossendale seat was held for Labour by Anthony Greenwood ."

Prior to his political career, Schiff was involved with a variety of activist groups and causes ranging from human rights with the Human Rights Campaign, to historic preservation with Save Our Shubert. During his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially microbreweries, and strongly advocated against a publicly funded stadium for the Minnesota Vikings. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for Mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June. His third and final term on the City Council ended in January 2014."

The son of Charles Victor and Leila Josephine McIlwaine, he was born in Concord West in Sydney. He attended school in the Concord area and studied law part-time at the University of Sydney, completing the course in 1969. In 1970 he was admitted to the New South Wales Bar. He had joined the Australian Labor Party in 1965. In 1978, McIlwaine was selected as the Labor candidate for the marginal Liberal seat of Yaralla, and he defeated the sitting MP, Lerryn Mutton. Yaralla was replaced by Ryde in 1981, which McIlwaine duly won. He held the seat until 1988, when he was defeated by Liberal candidate Michael Photios. Subsequent to his defeat, he held the position of Judicial Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia (1997–98)."

  "text" : "George Graham (10 December 1812 – 14 February 1901) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in the Auckland, New Zealand. Graham was born in 1812; sources differ whether his birthplace was in Hove, East Sussex or at Frogmore in Berkshire, England. He belonged to Clan Graham, and his grandfather was an interpreter between the Scottish and the English. He became clerk of works with the Board of Ordnance aged 19, and belonged to the Royal Engineers for the next 25 years. He was posted to Ireland in 1835, to New South Wales in 1836, and to New Zealand in 1840. He worked for the Royal Engineers and was involved in public works, roading, and military installations. The Flagstaff War in the Bay of Islands in 1845–46 put a scare to the population of Auckland, and Graham supervised the enlargement of the Albert Barracks overlooking the town. He later claimed that the fortification of the barracks was not necessary, but by doing so, it would prevent the subdivision of the hill and that the area could thus later become a park. Indeed, Albert Park was formed in the 1880s. Graham was then sent to China, where he suffered a nervous breakdown after witnessing a fellow soldier being buried alive. He resigned from the military and returned to New Zealand, where he took up farming in Māngere. He represented the Newton electorate from 1861 to 1869, when he resigned. Graham retired to Hove in England for the last years of his life. He died at Hove on 14 February 1901. His son James Bannatyne Graham married Elizabeth Mary Josephine Sheehan, the sister of cabinet minister John Sheehan. Their son was George Samuel Graham."

The 1881 election in the newly formed Tauranga electorate was hotly contested. Four candidates were nominated: Morris; William Kelly, who had also previously represented the East Coast electorate; George Vesey Stewart, then the owner of the Bay of Plenty Times; and Henry Thomas Rowe, a surveyor and commission agent. Rowe announced his retirement from the contest on 6 December three days out from election day, urging his supporters to vote for Stewart instead. The unofficial results were released the day after the election (Saturday, 10 December) and Morris had a majority of 13 votes over Stewart, with the official declaration to be made on 12 December. This was deferred until 14 December, with Morris ahead by 10 votes. Stewart stood for the Tauranga mayoralty a few months later and was elected the town's first mayor. He represented the Tauranga electorate until 1885, when he resigned. He was later a member of the Legislative Council, from 15 May 1885 to 16 April 1903, when he died."

  "text" : "George Dodd (c. 1800 – 15 December 1864) was an English Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1841 to 1853. Dodd was the son of George Dodd of Montagu Square, London. He was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 12 March 1835. Dodd was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone, Kent on 29 June 1841 and held the seat until 1853. He was re-elected for Maidstone in the 1852 general election but his election was declared void on petition, and a by-election was held on 22 April 1853. He was one of the Gentlemen of Her Majesty's privy chamber from 1844. Dodd married Georgiana Sanders, daughter of Joseph Sanders. They had one son, George Ashley Dodd, born 29 Sept 1842. In 1865 Thomas Allom was commissioned to design a mausoleum for George Dodd at West Norwood Cemetery. The mausoleum is in the form of a small Gothic chapel with coloured marble, suggesting a north Italian inspiration for the design, and is now a Grade II listed building. It has been suggested that Dodd had bought sixteen houses designed by Thomas Allom in Kensington Park Gardens and wanted his mausoleum to be designed by the same architect."

  "text" : "George Kerr (1853–1930) was an Australian politician, grazier, and blacksmith. He was born on 7 February 1853 at Beadnell, Northumberland, England and after training to become a blacksmith moved to Queensland in 1877. He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

Born near Hanover Square in London to Liberal Party MP Francis Dyke Acland and Eleanor Margaret Cropper, Geoffrey was the younger brother of Richard Acland, who later became a Common Wealth Party and Labour Party MP. He studied at Rugby School, Trinity College, Cambridge, and the University of Grenoble. During World War II, he served with the Border Regiment, rising to become a Captain. After the war, Acland became joint managing director of some paper mills, and he stood unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party in Westmorland at each election from 1945 to 1959. From 1954 to 1956, he was the Chairman of the Liberal Party. Acland married Winifred Julian Dorothy Fothergill in 1932, and they were the parents of six children."

Hamidi graduated from Kabul University with a degree in finance. He spent a brief period in Pakistan and lived in the United States for almost nineteen years. He settled in the Washington, D.C. area, and worked as an accountant at Trans Am Travel, a wholesale travel agency in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2007, he returned to Afghanistan when the country was under the Karzai administration. On 27 July 2011, Hamidi was killed in Kandahar by a man who had hidden explosives inside his turban. The target killing or assassination was blamed on the Taliban insurgents, who are guided and supported by foreign elements such as Pakistan's ISI spy agency and Iran's Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force. Two other associates of Afghan President Hamid Karzai – his half brother Ahmad Wali Karzai and Jan Mohammad Khan – were assassinated in the weeks that preceded Haider's killing. Two of Hamidi's deputies and a police chief were previously assassinated. Hamidi himself survived a 2009 bomb attack on his car."

In 1891 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Balmain; he was elected for the Labor Party but refused to sign the pledge, subsequently joining the Free Traders. After his defeat in 1894 he rejoined the Labor Party and ran with its endorsement in several subsequent elections, without success. Clark died at Lakemba in 1933."

Four candidates were nominated: George Morris, who had previously represented the East Coast electorate; Stewart, then the owner of the Bay of Plenty Times; William Kelly, who had also previously represented the East Coast electorate; and Henry Thomas Rowe, a surveyor and commission agent. Rowe announced his retirement from the contest on 6 December three days out from election day, urging his supporters to vote for Stewart instead. The unofficial results were released the day after the election (on Saturday, 10 December) and Morris had a majority of 13 votes over Stewart, with the official declaration to be made on 12 December. This was deferred until 14 December, with Morris ahead by 10 votes. Stewart stood for the Tauranga mayoralty a few months later and was elected the town's first mayor. Stewart stood in the 1893 election in the Bay of Plenty electorate and came a distant fourth. His brother's wife was Adela Blanche Stewart, who wrote the book My Simple Life in New Zealand."

He was appointed as secretary of the CMS in New Zealand. In 1840 Clarke was made protector of aborigines by the recently appointed lieutenant-governor, Captain Hobson. The seat of government was transferred to Auckland, and there Clarke bought a large block of land from the Māori for the government. Governor George Grey abolished the protectorate in 1846. He returned to Waimate North and became a farmer and resumed his work as secretary of the CMS in New Zealand. However controversy in relation to land purchases by CMS missionaries resulted in Clarke being dismissed from the CMS in 1849. Clarke was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council and served from 1853 to 1855. He was appointed a judge of the Native Land Court in 1865. He died at Waimate North on 29 July 1875."

  "text" : "Gary W. Bikman (born November 13, 1943) is a Canadian politician who was previously an elected member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the electoral district of Cardston-Taber-Warner. Prior to his election to the legislature, Bikman served on the town council of Stirling, including stints as mayor, deputy mayor and councillor since 1980. Bikman was born and raised in southern Alberta. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Business Administration degree from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Bikman has extensive business experience, having successfully owned and managed an oilfield service company for 25 years. He cofounded and led ChopStix Restaurants from 2006 to 2010 and ChopStix International Franchising from 2010 to 2012. Bikman has been a sessional instructor at the University of Lethbridge’s faculty of management and at Lethbridge College. He has also served intermittently as a member of the Chinook Arch Regional Library Board and as a scout leader in the village of Stirling. Bikman has been a critic of the Alberta government's decision to cut funding supports for persons with developmental disabilities in the 2013-2014 budget. After the 2012 election, he faced some controversy when, in an interview with CTV News shortly after the his election, he attributed his party's defeat to urban voters, who largely remained loyal to the governing Progressive Conservatives, possessing less \"common sense\" than the rural voters who turned to the Wildrose Party. Bikman was first elected in the 2012 provincial election, as part of the Wildrose Party caucus. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. Bikman failed to earn the PC nomination as a candidate of his riding for the May 5, 2015 election."

  "text" : "Gustav Mattias Anton Kasselstrand (born 27 June 1987) was chairperson of the Sweden Democratic Youth (SDU) from 2011 to 2015 and was political secretary for the Sweden Democrats in the Swedish Riksdag from 1 January 2011 to 21 November 2012. He became acting chairman of the youth league upon the timeout of William Petzäll due to his alcohol problems in February 2011. He was elected ordinary chairman on 10 September 2011, and re-elected three consecutive times on 1 September 2012, 7 September 2013 and 29 November 2014. He resigned on the annual congress on 12 September 2015, having served as the chairman for nearly five years. In April 2015, Kasselstrand was expelled as a member from the mother party, the Sweden Democrats. The exclusion came after Kasselstrand's fellow colleague and vice chairman of SDU, William Hahne, had been voted the chairman of the Sweden Democrat's Stockholm district, against the will of the mother party leadership. Kasselstrand called the action \"undemocratic\" and meant that it was all a way for the party leadership to secure their own power and positions, and that they feared the upcoming generation in the youth league to gain more influence. Kasselstrand continued on his position as the chairman for SDU until the ordinary congress in September the same year. After Kasselstrand resigned on the congress in September 2015, Jessica Ohlson won the election as the new chairman against Tobias Andersson, who had major support from the party leaders in his candidacy. Ohlson is considered to be one of Kasselstrand's closest collaborators, having served as the youth league secretary during Kasselstrand's chairmanship. Only hours after Ohlson had been elected as the new chairperson, the Sweden Democrats announced that they break the ties between the party and the youth league to form a new youth league. Meanwhile, Ohlson declared that she continue to lead the original youth league as an independent youth league. Kasselstrand and Ohlson publicly declared that they \"will consider all opportunities\" in the future regarding the possibility to form a new political party. Kasselstrand also called for party leader Jimmie Åkesson to resign from his position. In January 2016, Kasselstrand announced that he had launched a podcast called \"Den kokta grodan\" (The boiling frog) with Erik Berglund."

  "text" : "Gary B. Myrick is Secretary for the Minority of the United States Senate. As Secretary for the Minority, Myrick is chief procedural advisor to the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator Harry Reid, and supervises the minority's reaction to the day-to-day Senate schedule. In so doing, he often works with the Secretary for the Majority, Laura Dove. Roll Call reporters and editors have repeatedly cited Myrick among leading Capitol Hill staffers. Myrick helped manage Senate passage of, among other things, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, the 2013 Farm Bill, and the immigration reform bill of 2013. Myrick served as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Chief of Staff in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In this post, Myrick oversaw the Majority Leader’s staff and was responsible for helping craft policy, develop strategy, and conduct outreach on behalf of the Majority Leader and Democratic Caucus. The Senate elected Myrick Secretary for the Majority on January 5, 2011. After the Republicans took back the majority in the 2014 elections, Myrick moved from Secretary for the Majority to Secretary for the Minority. Myrick joined Senator Reid’s office in 2003, when Reid, then Senate Minority Whip, asked him to serve as his Floor Counsel. In this position, Myrick quickly became one of Senator Reid’s top aides, and in 2005 he was named Deputy Chief of Staff. Reid is the third Senate Democratic Leader for whom Myrick has worked. He started his Senate career as an intern for Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell while attending the University of Maine. After graduating, he moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a staff assistant in Senator Mitchell’s office and as a member of Mitchell’s Cloakroom staff. While working in the Democratic Cloakroom, Myrick attended night classes at the Washington College of Law at American University, earning a J.D. in 1995. When Mitchell retired in 1995, Gary joined the Senate Floor Staff under incoming Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. Myrick lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his wife, Lauren, and their son, Henry."

He received his education in the public schools of Eau Claire and at the University of Wisconsin, graduating with a law degree in 1893. Blum was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin the same year. In February 1895, he formed a partnership in Eau Claire with John B. Fleming under the firm name of Fleming & Blum, with that arrangement continuing until January 1, 1908. In April 1901, Blum was elected Eau Claire County Judge and served in that capacity for 38 years. A special act of the Wisconsin State Legislature in 1927 greatly increased his powers and jurisdiction. Blum was heavily involved in the business community of the Chippewa Valley. In 1919, Judge Blum bought the Laycock and Drummond blocks of Eau Claire, Wisconsin for over $80,000 dollars. This was one of the largest real estate transfer deals in the history of the city. Blum was one of the founders of the Walter Brewing Company and Consumers Tire & Tube Company. Blum also served as director of the Union National Bank and of the Union Mortgage Loan Company until January 1, 1934. Judge Blum married Margaret D. McGillis and had two daughters and one son; Margaret, Genevieve, and George L., Jr. Blum died of heart disease in 1939."
