  "text" : "(This name uses Spanish naming customs: the first or paternal family name is O'Higgins and the second or maternal family name is Riquelme.) Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme (Spanish: [berˈnarðo oˈxiɣins]; 1778–1842) was a Chilean independence leader who, together with José de San Martín, freed Chile from Spanish rule in the Chilean War of Independence. He was a wealthy landowner of Spanish and Irish ancestry. Although he was the second Supreme Director of Chile (1817–1823), he is considered one of Chile's founding fathers, as he was the first holder of this title to head a fully independent Chilean state."

She had previously served on three terms on the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners, serving as vice chairman several times. Carney had an unsuccessful run for school board in 1995. During a late night House session on July 2, 2012, Carney mistakenly cast the deciding vote to override Governor Beverly Perdue's veto of Senate Bill 820, granting authority to make hydraulic fracturing legal in North Carolina. A longstanding House rule that disallows changing of a vote if the vote changes the outcome of the bill prevented Carney from correcting her electronic vote to reflect her intended position."

  "text" : "Bronwyn Kathleen Bishop (née Setright; born 19 October 1942) is a former Australian politician who was the 29th Speaker of the House of Representatives, holding the office between 12 November 2013 and 2 August 2015. Bishop served as a member of the Australian House of Representatives for the Liberal Party, representing the Division of Mackellar in New South Wales from 1994 to 2016. Earlier, between 1987 and 1994, she represented New South Wales in the Senate. Bishop held portfolios in the outer ministry during the first two terms of the Howard Government, serving as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel from 1996 to 1998 and as Minister for Aged Care from 1998 to 2001. In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election."

  "text" : "Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a distinguished career in North America with the British Army, Roche became a member of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politics—they were riddled with mixed metaphors (\"Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud\"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase (\"Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?\"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.While arguing for a bill, Roche once said, \"It would surely be better, Mr. Speaker, to give up not only a part, but, if necessary, even the whole, of our constitution, to preserve the remainder!\" While these Irish bulls have led many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have interpreted them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended his political career with the passage of the Act of Union 1800, which he supported. He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807."

  "text" : "Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (21 March 1679 – 16 April 1715) was an English nobleman and politician. He was the second son of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637–1715) by Jane Lowe, and became his father's heir upon the death of his elder brother Cecil in 1681. The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which saw the Protestant monarchs William and Mary accede to the British throne. Benedict Calvert would make strenuous attempts to have his family's title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England. In February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards the King restored the title to Maryland to Calvert's young son Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore."

  "text" : "Buckner Stith Morris (August 19, 1800 – December 16, 1879) served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1838–1839) for the Whig Party. Morris married Evelina Barker in Kentucky in 1832 and the couple moved to Chicago in 1834 where Morris established a law practice with J. Young Scammon and created the Chicago Lyceum, the city's first literary society. By 1835, however, Morris had left Scammon and was practicing law with Edward Casey. He was elected mayor of Chicago in 1838 and went on to serve terms as a city alderman. He ran for the office of Illinois Secretary of State in 1852 under the Whig ticket and served as a Lake County Circuit Court Judge from 1853-1855. Following Evelina's death in 1847, he married Eliza Stephenson in 1850. Eliza died in 1855. The former mayor was outspoken in his opposition the American Civil War and was suspected to sympathise with the \"Copperheads.\" In 1864, he was arrested for aiding in a Confederate attempt to free prisoners of war from Camp Douglas. He was held for 9 months, but was then exonerated by a military court. Being unable, while so detained, to attend to his business affairs, he lost most of his assets through foreclosures. Incensed over the treatment of their ancestor, his heirs refused to permit the donation of his historical material, diaries, etc., to the Chicago Historical Society, despite urging to that end. The first use recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary of the phrase, to hell in a hand basket, is in The Great North-Western Conspiracy in All Its Startling Details, by I. Windslow Ayer, in alleging that, at a meeting of the Order of the Sons of Liberty, Judge Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois said: \"Thousands of our best men were prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would 'send abolitionists to hell in a hand basket.'\""

  "text" : "Bernie Hansen (born November 26, 1944) is a former longtime Chicago alderman, serving on the Chicago City Council from 1983 to 2002, when he retired as alderman of the 44th Ward citing health reasons. He is a Democrat. Hansen was appointed to the Council when the incumbent alderman, John Merlo, unexpectedly resigned. In 1987 he defeated Dr. Ron Sable, a liberal gay activist, by a 52% to 47% margin in the race for 44th Ward alderman. It was a hard-fought campaign in the city's 44th Ward, which at the time was the heart of the city's gay community. Sable ran against Hansen again in 1991, but Hansen prevailed again, 65% to 35%. From 1994 to 2000, he served as one of four U.S. commissioners to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a presidential appointment to a bilateral treaty organization with Canada responsible for fisheries management research and recommendations and for sea lamprey control for the Great Lakes fisheries. For part of that time, he chaired the commission. He sponsored or co-sponsored several human rights ordinances, including the Human Rights Ordinance expanding protection against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and credit to gay males, lesbians, and persons with disabilities, an ordinance to assist victims of hate crimes, and a 1997 ordinance Hansen introduced to extend health-care benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian city employees. Thomas M. Tunney, his successor as 44th Ward alderman whom Hansen had \"hand-picked\", became Chicago's first openly gay alderman. Hansen was also an active proponent of environmentalist measures, including recycling programs and the extension of Chicago's moratorium against the creation of new landfills. Some residents of the Lakeview community voiced concern that Hansen was more concerned with building expensive condos and co-ops, then re-building the neighborhood with affordable housing during his tenure. He serves on the board of many community councils as well as fund raising organizations, including the John Merlo Sports Program. John Merlo was the son of Mike Merlo leader of the Unione Siciliana during the 1920s. Mike Merlo had such complete control of the Organized Crime activities in Chicago, that upon his death in 1924, a war between north side gangs against Johnny Torrio (with underling) Al Capone at his side, instantly erupted. The war lasted 4 bloody years and included the St. Valentines Day Massacre. After his retirement from the city council, he continued to serve as Democratic committeeman from the 44th Ward, ultimately handing over the title to Alderman Tom Tunney. John Merlo held the position from 1969-92. Hansen made an attempt to be a Democratic Congressional Candidate for Illinois' 5th District in 2002, but when the Democratic National Committee backed Clinton Administration phenom Rahm Emanuel in the race, Hansen withdrew and soon after resigned from the 44th Ward Aldermanic seat. He is married to Annette and has two sons, Paul and David. He has two grandchildren. He attended the University of Chicago and has residences in both Chicago and Arizona. He is a longtime Cubs fan and avid golfer."

He later served as a school councillor at St. John's Technical High School. He supported Sidney Green for the leadership of the provincial NDP in 1968 and 1969. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Jim Cowan by almost 1,000 votes in the riding of Winnipeg Centre under the slogan Bud Boyce, your choice. He was not appointed to cabinet in the legislative term which followed, although he served as Deputy Speaker for a few months in 1971. In the 1973, he was re-elected by an increased majority over Tory candidate Robert Wilson. On June 26, 1974, Boyce entered cabinet as the Minister responsible for Corrections and Rehabilitations. He held this position until the Schreyer government was defeated in the 1977 election. Boyce was re-elected in the 1977 election, defeating Tory candidate Philip S. Lee with a reduced majority. In 1979, he supported Sidney Green's unsuccessful bid to become interim leader of the provincial NDP. On March 3, 1981, Boyce announced that he was joining Green's new Progressive Party of Manitoba, along with fellow New Democratic MLA Ben Hanuschak. He ran for re-election in the redistributed riding of Fort Rouge in the 1981 election, but fared poorly, receiving only 243 votes. After being defeated, Boyce worked as a consultant. He died at home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1984, before the next election was held."

Woodside is also serving as the President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. First elected as a city councillor for Fredericton City Council in 1981, he also served as deputy mayor. In 1986, Woodside was elected Mayor of Fredericton and served eight terms as mayor over the next 30 years, which makes him the longest serving mayor of Fredericton. In 1999, Woodside resigned as mayor to run for MLA of the Fredericton North riding (No. 43) for the Liberal party. He lost to Peter Forbes of the Progressive Conservatives. Woodside ran for mayor again in 2004 and won. As mayor, Woodside can count a range of accomplishments, including promoting information technology in Fredericton, and the development of information technology infrastructure such as the Fred eZone wireless zone. During his tenure as mayor, music festivals have been promoted in Fredericton including the Harvest and Blues Jazz Festival, the Country Music Festival, and FredRock. While infill development and sustainability have been priorities of his tenure as mayor, he has also faced controversy over sprawling box-store development in the university woods, a previously protected wooded area. Woodside received an honorary doctor of laws degree from St. Thomas University in 2011. Eleven professors at the small liberal arts university protested, in part because of his refusal to proclaim Pride Weekend in the 1990s. In the 2016 municipal election, Woodside was defeated by city councillor Mike O'Brien."

  "text" : "Gordon Harold \"Bill\" Andersen (21 January 1924 – 19 January 2005) was a New Zealand communist and trade union leader. He was one of the participants in the 1951 Waterfront Lockout and the president of the Northern Drivers' Union and later the National Distribution Union. Andersen was the president of the Socialist Unity Party, which broke away from the Communist Party of New Zealand over the Sino-Soviet split, and he also led its successor, the Socialist Party of Aotearoa. One of the very few New Zealanders to take communism seriously, he visited the Soviet Union and kept a bust of Lenin on his desk. He stood for parliament in the safe National seat of Tamaki against Robert Muldoon in the 1972 election, 1975 election, 1978 election and 1981 election, receiving 108, 39, 62 and 188 votes respectively. Bill Andersen supported the Ngāti Whātua occupation of Bastion Point, now the site of Ōrākei marae. He organised union support for the Māori claiming ownership of the land. As a trade union leader, he frequently clashed with New Zealand National Party Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. Whenever the two flew from Auckland to Wellington, sympathetic NAC and Air New Zealand staff ensured the two leaders were seated next to each other. He remained an active trade unionist all his life. In May 2003 he was arrested on a picket line for obstruction. He kept working at the National Distribution Union and Northern Drivers Charitable Trust until the week of his death. Despite requests for no funeral, a large group gathered for his memorial ceremony at Ōrākei marae."

Germa first ran as an NDP candidate in the 1965 election, losing to Liberal incumbent Rodger Mitchell. Mitchell died in 1967, however, and in the resulting byelection, Germa won the seat. However, in the national election the following year, Germa lost to Jim Jerome of the Liberals, the same candidate he had faced in 1967. Germa subsequently ran in the 1971 provincial election, and represented the riding for ten years at Queen's Park."

  "text" : "Brenda Kay Chamberlain, PC (born April 9, 1952 in Toronto, Ontario) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons, representing the riding of Guelph for the Liberal Party from 1993 until her resignation as of April, 2008. Chamberlain was a home daycare owner and operator from 1979 to 1983, and served as the administrative assistant in a family-owned business from 1984 to 1987. She also served as Executive Director of the Wellington County Literacy Council from 1989 to 1993, and of the Guelph-Wellington Career Educational Council from 1992 to 1993. During this time she also served on the Wellington County Board of Education (1985–1993). Chamberlain sought the federal Liberal nomination in Guelph-Wellington in 1992. Chamberlain's main challenger for the nomination was to be former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Maine, who represented Guelph in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979. Maine dropped out of the race after the riding's nomination meeting was scheduled for an early date, arguing that this favoured Chamberlain. Chamberlain went on to win the Liberal nomination by acclamation. Maine later decided to run as an independent candidate against Chamberlain in the 1993 federal election. Chamberlain was elected handily as the Liberals took all but one of Ontario's 101 seats—the closest any party has come to sweeping the country's biggest province at the federal level. Chamberlain was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1997 and 2000. For many years, she was known as a strong supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Chamberlain won another easy victory in the election of 2004, defeating her Conservative opponent by nearly 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Guelph. Chamberlain was elected a fifth time in the election of 2006, in which the Conservative Party won a national minority government. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and was a vocal opponent of her own party's plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Chamberlain also voted against her party's same-sex marriage bill in 2005. She was also involved in legislation which forced Bell Canada to revise its 411 billing policy. Chamberlain served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1997 to 1999, and was parliamentary secretary to the president of the Queen's Privy Council, with special emphasis on public service reform and Métis and Non-Status Indians, from December 2003 to July 2004. Although opposition spread rumours that she was about to retire she stood for re-election in 2006 and won handily. Just over two years later, on March 7, 2008, Chamberlain announced her resignation from the House of Commons effective April 7. She did not provide a reason for her resignation. During that election and thereafter the Guelph Mercury subjected Chamberlain to increasing degrees of criticism. Hansard will show that Chamberlain's last official votes occurred during the finals of weeks of February 2008. Subsequently, in a 2008 by-election Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote was elected in the Guelph riding. Brenda Chamberlain served locally as a school trustee and federally as a Member of the House of Commons. She was elected for twenty-four consecutive years of public service."

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" McBride (May 10, 1945 – December 22, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina."

  "text" : "Robert \"Bob\" Skelly (born April 14, 1943) is a former Canadian politician from British Columbia. He was born April 14, 1943 at New Westminster, British Columbia and worked as a teacher. Skelly, the son of Robert Daniel Skelly and Dorothy Graham, was educated at the University of British Columbia. In 1965, he married Sonia Alexandra Shewchuk. He served in the BC Legislature from 1972 to 1987. The longest-serving member for Alberni constituency in history, he was elected five times. He was elected leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party in 1984 and was Opposition Leader in the BC Legislature until 1987. He resigned as MLA in early 1988 and was elected to the Canadian House of Commons representing the Federal riding of Comox—Alberni from 1988 to 1993. During his campaign in the 1986 election he showed such great gains against then Premier Bill Bennet that the Social Credit Party became alarmed and convinced Bennet to resign, replacing him with Bill Vander Zalm. During his campaign-launching speech on the day the election was called, Skelly had a brief nervous pause before assembled media, and this was seized upon by the media as their focus - ignoring other campaign events and issues presented by Skelly throughout the campaign. While the NDP failed to gain any seats under his leadership, neither did they lose any (Social Credit won 47 seats to the NDP's 22 in the newly enlarged BC Legislative Assembly). The NDP had dropped in popular vote from the previous election, though they scored a higher percentage than in the elections they won in 1972, 1991 and 1996. The NDP vote fell in each election after 1979 until the 2005 election. Following the election, the distribution of electoral districts in the province was declared to be biased in favour of Social Credit, suggesting that Skelly would have won if this hadn't been the case. The courts then ordered a fair redistribution. In 1986 Skelly resigned as NDP leader and in the following year, a party convention acclaimed Michael Harcourt as his successor. Skelly went on to federal politics and was elected Member of Parliament for the federal riding of Comox—Alberni in the 1988 federal election under the banner of the New Democratic Party. He ran for a second term but was defeated in the 1993 general election in which the New Democratic Party collapsed to nine seats.. Skelly served in parliament at the same time as his brother Ray Skelly."

Tripuri Sena was formed following the Left Front victory in 1977, and it engaged in physical combat against the left. Tripuri Sena soon evolved into the Tripura National Volunteers. For ten years, 1978-1988, Hrangkhawl led a violent struggle as the supremo of the TNV, which sought to expel the Bengali majority from Tripura. TNV soon got infamous for their campaign of ethnic cleansing in the rural areas of Tripura. In 1983 he expressed the political ambitions of TNV in the following words in a letter to the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi: Armed insurgency was necessary to reach your heart. Either you deport all foreign nationals who infiltrated into Tripura after October 15, 1947 or settle them anywhere in India other than Tripura... We demand a free Tripura. In 1988 TNV signed a peace treaty, and TNV was converted into a political party. TNV later merged with INPT."

In 1984 he started Skara Sommarland, a theme park. In 1991, Karlsson and count Ian Wachtmeister started the populist political party New Democracy. Attracting major media attention, and with a patriotic platform, the party received 6.7 percent of the vote in the parliamentary election in September. With no previous political experience, Karlsson suddenly found himself elected to the Riksdag as a Member of Parliament. When New Democracy imploded due to internal struggles and failed in the 1994 parliamentary election Karlsson went back to being a full-time businessman. He has started the popular Swedish reality television show Fame Factory, (a programme somewhat similar to the British show Pop Idol), in which he played an important role. Many Mariann artists have entered Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualifications for the Eurovision Song Contest. From 1978 to 2005, approximately 120 songs from Karlsson's record company competed, and 14 of these went on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song contest. Mariann artists include Herreys and Charlotte Perrelli, who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest (1984 and 1999, respectively). In March 2005, Karlsson filled out an application for membership in the Liberal People's Party during a television interview. When the party immediately responded with criticism of him, calling the move a media stunt, he did not go through with his application. Karlsson was a judge in the first five seasons of the TV show \"Talang\" on TV4, the Swedish version of America's Got Talent, between 2007–2011."

They had one son Andrew and three daughters, Christine, Carol and Robin. Neilson was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly on 23 November 1946 at the age of 21, representing the Australian Labor Party (ALP). For many years he was not only the youngest MHA in Tasmania, but also the youngest person to be elected to any Australian parliament. He held various cabinet offices, including those of Minister for Tourism and Attorney-General. He was Minister for Education for over ten years from 1958 to 1969, and again from 1972 to 1974. He was made Attorney-General again on 12 April 1974, and five days later was also made Deputy Premier, Police Minister and Environment Minister. When the Premier Eric Reece was required to retire due to his age, Neilson was elected Tasmanian Leader of the ALP and Premier of Tasmania, on 31 March 1975. He resigned as Premier, and from Parliament, on 1 December 1977. After his term as premier, Neilson accepted the position as Agent-General for Tasmania in London. In the 1980s, he wrote as a theatre critic for The Mercury newspaper in Hobart. He died in November 1989, aged 64."

  "text" : "Baxter Ward (November 5, 1919 – February 4, 2002) was a television news anchor who served two terms on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Prior to his election on the board, he ran third in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Sam Yorty for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1969. Ward served as a supervisor from 1972–1980. As supervisor Ward was a strong advocate for public transport. Under his aegis the county acquired eight rail cars, dubbed El Camino, to bootstrap commuter rail in the Los Angeles area. This effort failed, although the cars operated on Amtrak's San Diegan route for six months in 1978. Critics dubbed the train \"Baxter Ward's Choo-Choo\" and it contributed to his failed re-election in 1980. He was born Baxter Ward Schwellenbach in Superior, Wisconsin, and grew up in Ephrata, Washington. He was the nephew of Lewis Baxter Schwellenbach. During the 1950s and early 60s he introduced a non-fiction documentary television show called Adventure Tomorrow with Dr. Martin L. Klein, which presented technology of the exciting years of the early Space Age. The program's producer, George Van Valkenburg described the series as covering anything that moves, flies or explodes. , Ward was a television news anchor first at KCOP-Channel 13, and then with KABC-Channel 7 in Los Angeles before he ran for Mayor."

  "text" : "Dr Bruce Stephen Flegg (born 10 March 1954, in Sydney) is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 2004 to 2015, representing the electorate of Moggill in south-western Brisbane for the Liberal Party of Australia and its successor the Liberal National Party. He was the leader of the state Liberal Party from 2006 to 2007 and served as Minister for Housing and Public Works in the Newman government from April to November 2012. Flegg was born in Sydney and was a general practitioner before entering politics. At the 1993 federal election he contested the seat of Dickson which was ultimately delayed to a supplementary election due to the death of a candidate, but was defeated by the Labor candidate, Michael Lavarch. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 2004 state election, replacing former Liberal leader David Watson in the safe Liberal seat of Moggill. He was immediately elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party upon his election, and succeeded Bob Quinn as leader in 2006. He had only been Liberal leader for a number of days when then-Premier Peter Beattie called the 2006 state election, which the conservative parties lost decisively. He faced wide criticism in the wake of the election defeat regarding his performance during the campaign, and faced speculation of a challenge from rival Tim Nicholls. Nicholls was unable to gain sufficient support to oust Flegg in a closely divided caucus, but following ongoing tension, Flegg resigned as leader on 4 December 2007 and was succeeded by compromise candidate Mark McArdle. Flegg was not part of the initial shadow ministry following the merger of the Liberal Party and National Party to form the Liberal National Party in 2008, but was subsequently appointed Shadow Minister for Education in 2009. He was appointed Minister for Housing and Public Works following the party's landslide victory at the 2012 state election; however, he resigned in November following a series of controversies surrounding his ministerial dealings with his lobbyist son and allegations he had moonlighted as a GP while a minister. In October 2014, the LNP State Executive refused to support Dr Flegg's party preselection as a candidate for the January 2015 election, instead choosing to replace him with former AMA President Dr. Christian Rowan. He remained an LNP Member of Parliament until the January 2015 election when he did not re-contest his seat. Before Flegg's disendorsement, Moggill was suggested as a possible safe seat for Premier Campbell Newman to move to from his marginal seat of Ashgrove. He has four sons, one of whom, Jonathon Flegg, ran unsuccessfully for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly beachside seat of Coogee in 2007."

  "text" : "Barton \"Bart\" R. Peterson (born June 15, 1958) is the former mayor of the U.S city of Indianapolis, Indiana. A Democrat first elected in 1999, he was defeated in 2007 in a bid for a third term in what was widely viewed as a huge upset. A lifelong Indianapolis resident, Peterson graduated from North Central High School before attending Purdue University. After graduating from the University of Michigan Law School, he practiced law in Indianapolis for several years before joining the staff of Governor Evan Bayh, eventually serving as the Governor's Chief of Staff. Peterson announced his candidacy for mayor of Indianapolis in 1999 and defeated the Republican candidate, Indiana Secretary of State Sue Anne Gilroy, 52 percent to 41 percent. When Peterson took office in 2000, he became Indianapolis's first Democratic mayor since 1967. Among his accomplishments during his first term were the establishment of charter schools in the city and development of several arts and culture initiatives. Peterson was re-elected in 2003 with 63 percent of the vote, handily defeating Republican Marion County Treasurer Greg Jordan. During his second term, he led the efforts to consolidate city and county government, merging the Indianapolis Police Department with the Marion County Sheriff's Department to form the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department under the leadership of Marion County Sheriff Frank J. Anderson, and merging several township fire departments with the Indianapolis Fire Department. He also oversaw plans to construct a new home for the Indianapolis Colts while also expanding the Indiana Convention Center. Peterson is also credited for attracting additional downtown development including the construction of a downtown Simon Property Group headquarters and Conrad Hotel tower. Peterson was expected to easily cruise to re-election in 2007 as no well-known Republican candidates entered the race, leaving relatively unknown political newcomer Greg Ballard as his opposition. Indeed, many thought that the once-dominant Republican Party was all but dead in the city. However, largely due to high property taxes and a rising crime rate, several polls rated the race about even as election day approached. When voters went to the polls, Peterson lost to Ballard by a margin of 51 percent to 47 percent. Prior to the election, both Democrats and Republicans considered Peterson a political star, and he had been mentioned as a candidate for governor or the United States Senate. Now a \"fallen star\", the loss prompted many pundits to declare it the biggest political upset in Indiana history. In December 2007, Peterson was mentioned as a possible candidate in the special election to fill the seat of recently deceased Congresswoman Julia Carson. A few days later, Peterson ruled out a run for this office. Harvard University's Institute of Politics hired Peterson as a resident fellow in January 2008. At Harvard he led study groups on urban politics that he confronted in his time as mayor, including building arts communities, education reform, sports facilities, and homelessness. Living Cities, a national philanthropic organization that conducts research and advocates on behalf of cities, selected Peterson as one of its first two Distinguished Urban Fellows in March 2008. Peterson remains involved in community activities in Indianapolis, particularly as the Chair of the Board of Directors for The Mind Trust, a nonprofit organization he founded in 2006 with his former charter schools director David Harris to promote entrepreneurship in education. In June 2009, Peterson joined Eli Lilly and Company as senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications. This is the same position Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels previously held."

Coleridge was the eldest son of John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge, Lord Chief Justice of England, and Jane Fortescue Seymour. His grandfather, John Taylor Coleridge, was the nephew of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford. He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1877. Coleridge was elected Member of Parliament for Sheffield Attercliffe in the 1885 general election and held the seat until 1894 when he succeeded his father as second Baron Coleridge. Coleridge became a QC in 1892 and served as a Judge of the High Court of Justice from 1907 to 1923. Lord Coleridge married Mary Alethea Mackarness, daughter of John Fielder Mackarness (Bishop of Oxford), on 3 August 1876. They had three children, one son and two daughters. He died in September 1927, in Honiton, Devon, aged 76, and was succeeded in the barony by his only son Geoffrey."

  "text" : "The Hon. Basdeo Panday (Hindustani: बसडेओ पाण्डेय; born 25 May 1933) was the fifth Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago from 1995 to 2001; he also served as Leader of the Opposition from 1976–1977, 1978–1986, 1989–1995, 2001–2006 and 2007–2010. He was first elected to Parliament in 1976 as the Member for Couva North. He is the former Chairman and party leader of the Opposition United National Congress. In 2006, Panday was convicted of failing to declare a bank account in London and imprisoned but as of March 20, 2007, that conviction has been quashed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted bail on April 28 pending the outcome of his appeal due to his health condition and the poor state of health facilities at the Arouca prison. On May 1 he decided to resign as Chairman of the United National Congress, but the party's executive refuse to accept his resignation. However, he lost the party's internal elections on January 24, 2010 to Deputy Leader and current Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar by a large margin. Basdeo Panday is married to Oma Panday née Ramkissoon and has four daughters Niala, Mickela, Nicola, and Vastala, one from his first marriage to Norma Panday née Mohammed who died in 1981. In 2006, he was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman by the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs."

Betty Chew Gek Cheng (Chinese: 周玉清; pinyin: Zhōu Yù Qīng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Chiu Ge̍k-chheng; born 15 August 1964) is a Malaysian Chinese politician from the Democratic Action Party (DAP). As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes."

  "text" : "William W. \"Bill\" Bunten (born 1930) is a Kansas politician and the previous mayor of Topeka, Kansas, having been elected to a four-year term in 2005 and re-elected in 2009. Before being elected mayor, he served in the Kansas House of Representatives from 1962 to 1990 and in the Kansas Senate from 2002 to 2004. He previously ran for mayor in 2001 and in a special election in 2003. Bunten is a member of the Republican Party. Bunten was the first mayor to be elected in Topeka under the new council-manager government, which stripped most of the powers of the office of mayor. Instead, the city council and appointed city manager holds most of the power. As such, Bunten's role is limited to leading city council meetings, promoting economic development, and being the \"ceremonial head\" of the city. He replaced James McClinton as mayor, who did not seek a second term after the powers of the office were reduced. A native Topekan, Bunten was a basketball player while attending Topeka High School. He was a teammate and good friend of Dean Smith, who later went on to fame as a basketball coach at North Carolina. Bunten and Smith both attended the University of Kansas and were members of Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity. After college Bunten entered the US Marine Corps and served in Korea, rising to the rank of Captain. In 2010, Bunten decided to change the name of Topeka to Google in honor of the company Google, Inc. for one day. This was considered a ploy to attract Google to Topeka as a site for a high speed Internet installation. The site eventually was located in Kansas City, Kansas. Bunten has led an effort to improve the downtown area and promoted a plan to raise funds for the development of the area. In 2012, Bill Bunten announced that he would not seek re-election in April 2013 at a City Council meeting."

Monette has been involved in many non-profit groups including, the Cumberland Community Resource Centre; Ottawa Arthritis Society; Queenswood Heights Neighbourhood Watch Association; Queenswood Heights Community Association, Fallingbrook Community Association.

He served as Director General (1956–1967) of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). He drew on his experience as relief commissioner (1942–1943) during the Bengal famine of 1943 to build the FAO from a data-gathering bureaucracy into a major force against world hunger. He studied at the Scottish Church College of the University of Calcutta and subsequently at the University of Oxford. Sen joined the Indian Civil Service in Bengal in 1922. His work as director general of food for all India (1943–1946), for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1944, convinced him that hunger and malnutrition were crucial issues in the modern world. He took his concerns to the international stage as a member of India's first delegation to the UN (1947), as Indian Ambassador to the United States, and several other countries including Italy, Yugoslavia, Japan, and Mexico. He worked on a variety of FAO projects before being named Director General in 1956. In 1960 Sen announced the Freedom from Hunger campaign, which led to the 1963 World Food Congress in Washington, D.C., attended by representatives from more than 100 countries."

The 50th Ward encompasses part of Chicago's far North Side and includes the West Ridge, West Rogers Park and Peterson Park neighborhoods. First elected to the Council in 1973, Stone was the second longest-serving alderman (after Edward M. Burke). His tenure spanned the terms of seven Mayors, from Richard J. Daley to Richard M. Daley. Stone was also Vice Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1998 to 2011. Stone was a member of the \"Vrdolyak 29\", which opposed Mayor Harold Washington's agenda. For most of his life a Democrat, Stone followed Alderman Edward Vrdolyak to the Republican Party, and unsuccessfully challenged Carol Moseley Braun for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Stone was a protagonist in a protracted legal conflict with the neighboring suburb of Evanston in 1993–1994. Employees of Stone's 2007 re-election campaign were convicted of vote fraud in 2010. Stone was \"outspoken\" and \"relished the rough and tumble of politics\"."

The circumstances of his later life and premature death are cited by physicians who believe the overwhelming evidence for the biological etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome. Brynmor John had been diagnosed with the illness, and died suddenly immediately after exiting the House of Commons gym.

  "text" : "MGen Robert \"Bob\" Ringma (30 June 1928 – 31 March 2014) was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 1997. By career, he was a soldier for the Canadian Forces. Born in Richmond, British Columbia, Ringma served in the Canadian Forces, serving during the Korean War. He attained the rank of Major General before leaving the military in 1983. His military experiences in Korea, particularly with the Mobile Laundry and Bath Unit (MLBU), are recounted in his book MLBU Full Monty in Korea (ISBN 1-894263-85-5). He was elected in the Nanaimo—Cowichan electoral district for the Reform Party in the 1993 general election. In 1996, he attracted controversy when he stated in a newspaper interview that store owners should be free to move gays and blacks \"to the back of the shop\", or even to fire them, if the presence of that individual offended a bigoted customer. Ringma was suspended from the Reform Party caucus for several months after fellow MP Jan Brown spoke out against the prominence of extremist views in the party (although Brown herself was also suspended.) Ringma left politics after serving in the 35th Canadian Parliament and retired to Thetis Island, British Columbia. Ringma had three children with his wife Paula MacDowell. He died on 31 March 2014, aged 85."

  "text" : "Brian Kevin O'Malley (22 January 1930 – 6 April 1976) was a British Labour Party politician. O'Malley was educated at Mexborough Grammar School and Manchester University. He was a teacher and lecturer and a trade union branch official. O'Malley was elected Member of Parliament for Rotherham in a 1963 by-election. He served as a government whip from 1964 to 1969. He was junior Health and Social Security Minister from 1969 to 1970, and became Minister of State for that department in 1974. O'Malley's crowning achievement was obtaining cross-party support for a new State pension scheme (after two aborted attempts by previous Governments) and steering through Parliament the bill to implement what became the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. While Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State, took much of the credit, it was O'Malley who did all the hard work. In 1976, O'Malley's career was cut short by his death at the age of 46, following complications after brain surgery. Stanley Crowther was elected as his successor in the subsequent by-election."

Before entering politics he was a lay preacher in the Methodist Church. At the 1918 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Bishop Auckland constituency, and held the seat until his death at the age of 50. In parliament, he found himself at odds with many Labour MPs and contemplated joining the Liberals. He was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip in 1924, when he was made a Privy Councillor. He had suffered from poor health since contracting malaria at Salonika during World War I. On a visit to London in December 1928, he was found dead in bed at the Regent Palace Hotel. At the inquest, his son said that his father had taken to drinking heavily. His death, it was decided, was due to syncope from disease of the heart and liver, due to chronic alcoholism."

Mockler was appointed to the Canadian Senate in late 2008, and a by-election was held in early 2009. Paulin stood again for the Liberals and was re-elected.

Clark became the thirteenth mayor of Glace Bay in a 1981 by-election, succeeding longtime mayor Dan A. Munroe who had resigned. Clark served as mayor until 1988, when he left the mayor's office in a bid to become MLA for the riding of Cape Breton East, running as a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia under the leadership of John Buchanan. Clark lost the election to John MacEachern, who was the Liberal candidate. During his time as mayor, Clark achieved success for the town in a variety of ways, perhaps most notable is the cleanup project of Glace Bay's sewage area, spearheading the development of Renwick Brook. As a result of Clark's efforts some still refer to Renwick Brook as \"Bruce's Brook\". Clark ran for mayor of Glace Bay once again in 1991 and lost by a narrow margin to Donald MacInnis. Clark currently holds a management position with the Nova Scotia Community College. Although no longer directly involved in politics, he still remains an avid follower of local, provincial and federal politics. Clark is married to Jane (Burden) Clark, a retired schoolteacher and the couple still reside in Glace Bay. They have been married since 1975 and have three children."

  "text" : "Sir Bryan Cartledge KCMG (born 10 June 1931), is a former British diplomat and academic. After studying at Hurstpierpoint College and St John's College, Cambridge, he took research posts at St Antony's College, Oxford and the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. He was inspired to become a diplomat after being invited to assist the former British prime minister and foreign secretary Sir Anthony Eden with his memoirs. In the British Diplomatic Service, Cartledge served in Sweden, the Soviet Union and Iran before being appointed, in 1977, to be Private Secretary (Overseas Affairs) to the British Prime Minister; he served both James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher in that capacity before taking up his first ambassadorial appointment as British ambassador to Hungary in 1980. He then headed the Defence and Overseas Secretariat of the Cabinet Office, as deputy secretary of the British Cabinet, before returning to Moscow as ambassador, where he had regular dealings with Mikhail Gorbachev and Eduard Shevardnadze. Cartledge left the Diplomatic Service in 1988 on his election to be Principal of Linacre College, Oxford. In Oxford, he has edited six books on environmental issues. He holds diplomas in the Hungarian language from the University of Westminster (UK) and University of Debrecen (Hungary). His history of Hungary, The Will to Survive, fulfills an aspiration which grew out of his deep interest in the country where he served three years as ambassador. He subsequently wrote Károlyi & Bethlen: Hungary - The Peace Conferences of 1919-23 and Their Aftermath\"."

  "text" : "Bertie Hazell, CBE (18 April 1907 – 11 January 2009), also known as Bert Hazell, was a British Labour Party politician and trade union activist. The son of a Norfolk farm worker, he left school at 14 to work on a farm in Wymondham, where his duties included scaring crows. When agricultural wages slumped after the First World War sparking the Norfolk farm workers' strike in 1923, Hazell became active in the National Union of Agricultural Workers. He worked as a district organiser for the NUAW, 1937–1964. He unsuccessfully contested the safe Tory parliamentary seat of Barkston Ash in Yorkshire in the 1945 and 1950 elections, before returning to Norfolk to help North Norfolk Labour MP Edwin Gooch. In 1945 he came within 116 votes of victory in Barkston Ash. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for North Norfolk in 1964 by just 53 votes. The constituency was unusual in being an agricultural seat electing Labour MPs since 1945, owing to a history of organised agricultural trade unionism and a working-class rural Labour vote in Norfolk at the time, very atypical of the rest of the country. He was re-elected in 1966, when his majority was 737 votes. He lost his seat at the 1970 general election to the Conservative Ralph Howell who held the seat for 27 years. Subsequently Labour have never regained Norfolk North, and were relegated to third place when the Liberal Democrats gained the seat in 2001. As president of the NUAW for 10 years until he retired in 1978, Hazell devoted nearly 60 years to the cause of agricultural workers. He had a lengthy career in the health service including as chair of York Health Authority in the 1980s. Hazell was made an MBE for services to agriculture in 1946 and a CBE for services as chairman of the regional board for industry in 1962. Hazell, who reached his 100th birthday in April 2007, was the second longest-living MP in British history; only Theodore Cooke Taylor lived longer, beating Hazell in the longevity stakes by around six months. On 6 November 2008 he overtook the late Lord Shinwell's record as the longest-living former MP of recent times. Upon Hazell's death, James Allason became the oldest living former MP. He died on 11 January 2009, aged 101. He was three months short of his 102nd birthday."

In 1944 she was elected MLA for Maple Creek. Defeated in 1948, she returned to her active role in Homemakers and in the local church; she received a life membership in the Lemsford Homemakers Club. Trew was a member of the national council of the CCF for eleven years, and vice-president of the Saskatchewan section of the party for eight years. When the Saskatchewan Farmers Union was organized in 1950, she and her husband joined; she became women’s district director in 1953, and was elected women’s president of the provincial farm union in 1958, a post she held for five years. She represented farm union women at three meetings of the Associated Country Women. Trew was a member of the Thompson Advisory Planning Committee on Medical Care, which in 1961 laid the groundwork for Canada’s first universal medical care plan. The committee study took her to England, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. She died in a traffic accident on June 4, 1976. She is the grandmother of long-time Regina NDP MLA Kim Trew"

  "text" : "Brian J. Aungst, Sr. served as the mayor of one of Florida's largest cities, Clearwater, for two terms from 1999-2005. Term limits kept him from seeking a third term. He was credited with turning a stagnant city around, serving as the catalyst to attract unprecedented economic development to a once dormant community. During his six-year tenure he attracted nearly $750 million of economic development to Clearwater including a sweeping redevelopment of the city's number-one economic engine, Clearwater Beach. Mayor Aungst served on Pinellas County's Tourist Development Council, the advisory board of Pinellas County's Convention and Visitors Bureau, using his position as mayor to encourage tourists to visit the area, especially after the events of 9/11/2001. Aungst was instrumental in putting together a public-private partnership to build a new Community Sports Complex Bright House Networks Field to host Philadelphia Phillies Spring Training Baseball and their minor league team the Clearwater Threshers and other community events. In addition he spearheaded a public-private partnership to build a new 90,000-square-foot (8,400 m2) signature public library in downtown Clearwater. Under his leadership the city built multiple community recreation centers and athletic complexes and was named Sports Illustrated magazine's \"Sports Town USA\" for the state of Florida. He was the first Mayor of Clearwater, Florida to be re-elected unopposed since 1956. Aungst supported his successor Mayor Frank Hibbard who was elected unopposed to replace him in 2005 and re-elected in 2008. Brian Aungst presided over the Clearwater City Commission for almost six years of unprecedented growth."

  "text" : "Bradley Joseph Schlozman (born February 6, 1971) is an American attorney who served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.  A member of the Republican Party, Schlozman was appointed by Gonzales as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, replacing Todd Graves, and he assumed that office on March 23, 2006. In April 2007, Schlozman left the U.S. Attorney position to work at the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. Schlozman and his office came under review by Congressional and Senate investigators regarding the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys and alleged inappropriate politicization of the Civil Rights Division. The Department of Justice Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility alleged that Schlozman had violated the law and made false statements to Congress about his hiring decisions. While Schlozman testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that his personnel decisions were not based on party affiliation, the report cited emails and other communications in which Schlozman discussed hiring \"right-thinking Americans\" and ridding the Civil Rights Division of \"pinkos\", \"commies\", and attorneys perceived to be unacceptably liberal. Federal prosecutors, however, declined to file charges of criminal perjury against Schlozman, drawing criticism from Senate Democrats. Schlozman resigned from the Department of Justice on August 17, 2007, and accepted a position with the Hinkle Law Firm in Wichita, Kansas."

  "text" : "William Brian Maginess, QC (10 July 1901 – 16 April 1967) was a member of the Government of Northern Ireland, who was widely seen as a possible successor to Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Born in 1901, the son of a Lisburn solicitor, he was educated at The Wallace High School and Trinity College Dublin from where he graduated with a Law degree (LLD), and was called to the Northern Ireland bar in 1923. Having served in the Royal Corps of Artillery during the Second World War he entered the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1938 when he won the Lisburn-centered seat of Iveagh. He entered the Cabinet of Basil Brooke in 1945 when he became Minister of Labour. His stints as the Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Finance (de facto Deputy Prime Minister) left him favorite to succeed Brooke as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. In the early 1950s however, Maginess became a hate figure for the Orange Order when he banned marches through Catholic areas in Counties Down and Londonderry. Brooke demoted him to the non-Cabinet post of Attorney General in April 1956. While Attorney General, Maginess was party to the case of Attorney General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher [1961] 3 All Er 299, which remains authority in the law of Northern Ireland and England & Wales for the principle that Dutch courage is not a defence in criminal law. Counsel for Gallagher were future Attorney General and Lord Justice, Basil Kelly, and future Stormont MP and Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association in England, Richard Ferguson. In December 1959, Ian Paisley led a demonstration of Ulster Protestant Action members to Stormont Castle to protest at Brooke's refusal to dismiss Maginess and Sir Clarence Graham for making speeches at an Ulster Young Unionist Council event supporting Catholic membership of the Ulster Unionist Party. Having been appointed a King's Counsel in 1946 he was appointed a County Court Judge in 1964 when he resigned from Parliament. He died three years later in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital at age 65. A plaque in his memorial is cited inside the Church of Ireland parish church in Hillsborough, where he is buried."

An active member of the Labour Party since 1978; however, he had never held any elected office or public role before his election to the Seanad.

He was one of only seven Labour Party TDs returned to the Dáil at the 2016 general election. Of the other six, four were outgoing ministers and the other two were Ministers of State during the 31st Dáil."

  "text" : "Bryan Cusack (2 August 1882 – 24 May 1973) was an Irish Sinn Féin politician and medical doctor. He was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for Galway North at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann, though Cusack did not attend as he was in prison. He was re-elected as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway constituency at the 1921 general election. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. He was re-elected as an anti-Treaty Sinn Féin TD for Galway at the 1922 general election but did not take his seat in Dáil Éireann. He did not contest the 1923 general election. He became a founder member of Fianna Fáil in 1926 and stood unsuccessfully for the party in Galway at the June 1927 general election. He did not contest any more elections and he resumed his medical career."

  "text" : "Boonsanong Punyodyana (Thai: บุญสนอง บุณโยทยาน; rtgs: Bunsanong Bunyothayan) was a Thai politician and General secretary of the Socialist Party of Thailand. He was assassinated on February 28, 1976. After graduating from Chulalongkorn University in 1959, he worked for the Thai government, preparing English translations of official manuals. His skill in English and his familiarity with the Thai governmental structure gained him employment with the United States Information Service in Bangkok as a writer and researcher. In 1962, he won a Fulbright-Hayes Scholarship to study for the master's degree in sociology at the University of Kansas. At that point, one would not have predicted that he would one day lead student demonstrators to rip the brazen eagle from the gate of the U.S. Embassy on Wireless Road, as he did following the Mayaguez incident. After receiving the M.A., Boonsanong returned to Thailand where he joined the staff of Thammasat University as a lecturer in sociology. In 1967 he returned to the U.S. and spent five extremely productive years there. He completed a Ph.D. in sociology at Cornell University, published several articles, spent a year at Harvard University and another year as Visiting Professor at the University of Hawai'i. By the time of his return to Thailand in 1972, he had established himself as an internationally recognized scholar in his field. It was a record that few of his colleagues in Thailand could equal, including those who were many years his senior. Back at Thammasat University in June 1972, he immediately became one of the university's leading activists. This was a time of general intellectual ferment. Boonsanong was in his element, writing papers, attending meetings, carrying out research, organizing and lecturing to hundreds of rapt and enthusiastic young people. The student movement which was to overthrow the military dictatorship was beginning and Thammasat was its epicenter. Dr. Boonsanong Punyodyana fell to an assassin's bullet at about 1:30 a.m. on 28 February 1976. At the time of his death, he was the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party of Thailand. There is little doubt that his death was politically motivated. Since few among Thailand's ruling elite regretted his passing, not many expect his murderers to be apprehended. He will be sorely missed however, by his wife and two daughters, by his academic colleagues, and by the Thai people."

He served as a member of the Saskatchewan Legislature from 1991 to 2002 and returned to office in the 2007 Saskatchewan general election. Boyd was first elected as the member representing the Kindersley electoral district in the 1991 Saskatchewan general election. He defeated two other candidates in a hotly contested race to win his district. Boyd became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan on November 21, 1994. He led the party into the 1995 Saskatchewan general election. The party only won five seats after major scandals from the Progressive Conservative government of Grant Devine had come to light. Boyd was personally re-elected in his district by a wide margin. Boyd left the Progressive Conservative party in 1997 and to help form the Saskatchewan Party. He was re-elected to his third term in the 1999 Saskatchewan general election winning his largest plurality to date. He stepped down in 2002 vacating his seat. Boyd returned to the Saskatchewan Legislature in the 2007 Saskatchewan general election. On November 21, 2007, he was appointed Minister of Energy and Resources and Minister Responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs under Premier Brad Wall.

Henderson served in World War II as part of the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army and, in 1949, achieved the honorary rank of captain. In the aftermath of Northern Ireland general election, 1953, he became a member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons for the safe Belfast Victoria seat. His election saw the Unionist majority against Labour slashed from 8,907 in 1949 to 1,662. In 1958 he narrowly lost the seat to David Bleakley. The same year he was appointed, at Ulster Television, to the executive position of director, before taking up the post of managing director of the Belfast Newsletter and then moving to Chairman of Century Newspapers in 1964. Henderson's family owned the Newsletter from 1844 until 1991. From 1964 to 1991, he was the final member of the Henderson family to be in control of the publication and, by the time of his retirement, was the only member of a three-person Board with executive responsibilities. Century Newspapers, the holding company, sold the title to Thompson Regional Newspapers in 1991 as the family could no longer guarantee the viability of the paper following Bill Henderson's retirement despite attempts to hire suitably qualified management Between 1970 and 1981 he was President of Knock Motor Cycle & Car Club in Belfast and, in Spring 2005, became a trustee of the Ulster Reform Club."

In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann. Higgins was re-elected as an anti-Treaty Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) at the 1921, 1922 and 1923 elections. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it.

  "text" : "Brownie Samukai is the Minister of National Defence of Liberia. He took office on January 16, 2006, as part of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's Cabinet. In the 1980s he worked within the Liberian Ministry of National Defense. In 1986-87 he was working within the G-4 Branch of the AFL. In 1991, according to biographical details issued at a 2007 U.S. Institute of Peace briefing, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Defence for Operations. The biographical details said that he 'was responsible for reestablishing civilian control over the Liberian army and established an urban response team to counter urban terrorism.' He served in this position until 1994. In 1993-94, he served as commander of the 'Black Berets,' a paramilitary police force in the Monrovia enclave of Amos Sawyer's Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU). The International Crisis Group also notes that the Black Berets also fought alongside ECOMOG at times, notably during Charles Taylor's 1992 assault on Monrovia ('Operation Octopus'). 'They and the AFL were accused of killing some 600 civilians in the June 1993 Camp Carter massacre, which, testimony at the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission has indicated, was perpetuated by Taylor's NPFL fighters, who may have orchestrated it to put blame on the Armed Forces of Liberia.' He served as Director of the Liberian National Police from 1994–95 and Deputy Minister of State for Administration from 1995 to 1997. In 1998 he served on the AFL Restructuring Commission, where he was listed as a retired Colonel of the AFL in private business. From 1999 to c.2004/05 he served as a security officer with the United Nations, initially with UNTAET in East Timor, and then from 2000 with UNHCR and the UN Department of Safety and Security in Tanzania. Responsible for refugee resettlement in Tanzania."

He took office following the resignation of John V. Kenny. Berry achieved a level of notoriety for having banned both rock and roll music as well as an \"obscene\" film from Jersey City during his tenure. Berry banned the film The Moon Is Blue from being shown for being \"indecent and obscene\" and refused to allow Bill Haley and the Comets to play a concert at municipally-owned Roosevelt Stadium. The latter act is believed to have inspired Haley to write the first protest song in rock and roll, \"Teenager's Mother,\" which included the lyrics \"Are you right? Did you forget too soon? How much you liked to do the Charleston?\" In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the US immigration station, Berry commandeered a US Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim Ellis Island."

  "text" : "Benjamin Raspail (16 August 1823, Paris – 24 September 1899, Cachan, Seine, now Val-de-Marne), was a painter-engraver and politician of the French Third Republic. He was the son of François-Vincent Raspail. Like his father, he was classed extreme-left and was also exiled to Belgium. In 1874, following the death of Eugène Lavenant, Raspail took over as Mayor of Arcueil as \"premier conseiller inscrit au tableau\". He was also a member of the conseil général for Seine. As member of the council for Seine for the Republican left, Raspail proposed the law, on 21 May 1880, which made 14 July a national holiday in commemoration of the storming of the Bastille and the Fête de la Fédération. The bill was signed by 64 members, and was adopted by the Assemblée Nationale on 8 June and by the Sénat on 29 June. The bill was promulgated on 6 July 1880. He also proposed the law to seize the crown jewels from the monarchy, which was passed on 11 January 1887. He lost a leg, which had to be amputated, following a chase in Épinay by a stone-throwing mob. Upon his death, Raspail bequeathed his estate in Cachan to become a retirement home for people with work-related disabilities, and also a museum which would house his father's political documents and painting collection, as well as his own painting collection."

He was re-elected at the 1948 general election but lost his seat at the 1951 general election. He was subsequently elected to 7th Seanad by the Agricultural Panel. He stood unsuccessfully at the 1954 general election but was elected to the 8th Seanad. He was defeated at the 1957 Seanad election. In the early 1940s, Commons was imprisoned for one month in Sligo Prison for his part in the Mayo land agitation, after which he won a Dáil seat."

  "text" : "Abraham (Bram) Peper (born 13 February 1940) is a Dutch sociologist and former politician. Peper was Mayor of Rotterdam and Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and is member of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA). After finishing the HBS, Peper studied social sciences at the University of Amsterdam until 1965 and economy and sociology at the University of Oslo (1963/1964) and got his PhD at the Nederlandse Economische Hogeschool (Currently Erasmus University) in 1972. Peper became researcher, and fulfilled several academic functions, including professor at the Erasmus University until he became Mayor of Rotterdam in 1982 at the age of 42. Rotterdam is the second largest city of the Netherlands, and Peper was one of the youngest mayors of a large city at the time. In 1984 an interview with Peper and his wife with Ischa Meijer was published in Vrij Nederland, a Dutch magazine, in which Peper was critical towards citizens and rulers. The interview was perceived as arrogant, and seemed to be made while Peper was in a drunk condition. Peper made his apologies, and soon after he and his wife divorced. While Peper was mayor, the city completed its process of rebuilding after World War II, which resulted in a new skyline for Rotterdam. In the second half of his mayorship, Peper had a tough time with for instance his defeat on the formation of a city province (90% of the voters in a referendum were against). Peper was mayor until 1998, when he joined the government as minister of the interior of the Netherlands in the cabinet Kok II. Starting 1999, rumours were spreading that Peper had made incorrect declarations while he was mayor of Rotterdam. On 13 March 2000 Peper resigned as minister, according to himself to no longer bring problems to the public government, and to be better able to defend himself. Although a report on 17 March suggested that Peper did not act properly regarding the declarations, Peper won the legal procedures finally two years later. From 2002 until 2004 Peper was professor at the University Nijenrode, a private university, from which he resigned due to a disagreement regarding a study trip to the European Union in Brussels."

Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the Salford constituency was divided into three divisions, and Armitage was elected as the first MP for the new Salford West seat at the 1885 general election. A further election was held in 1886, and he was defeated by his Conservative opponent, Lees Knowles. Armitage did not re-enter parliament. In January 1899 he was awarded the freedom of the Borough of Salford. In 1856 he married Elizabeth Southam of Manchester. They made their home at Chomlea Bank, Pendleton."

  "text" : "Bradford Lyttle (born November 20, 1927) is an American pacifist and peace activist. He was an organizer with the Committee for Non-Violent Action of several major campaigns against militarism, including \"Omaha Action\", against land-based nuclear missiles (1959); \"Polaris Action\" against submarine-based nuclear missiles (1960); the San Francisco to Moscow Peace Walk (1961); and the Quebec-Washington-Guantanamo Peace Walk (1963). In 1965 Bradford gave lectures on 'Non-Violent resistance' for the newly founded Free University of New York. Among his theoretical works are a 1958 pamphlet presenting the case for nonviolent national defense against aggression; and a mathematical formula called \"The Apocalypse Equation\", which argues that, over time, the probability of nuclear missiles being used approaches 100%. He is also the founder and perennial candidate for the office of President of the United States of the United States Pacifist Party. He ran as a write-in candidate in the 1984, 1996, and 2000 elections, and on the ballot in the state of Colorado in 2008. In 2008 Lyttle came in second to last of sixteen candidates in Colorado for which he received 110 votes, beating only Gene Amondson of the Prohibition Party. In Colorado, Amondson came in last place among all candidates with ballot access (though Amondson won enough votes elsewhere to surpass Lyttle's total nationally). Lyttle has been arrested for nonviolent peaceful demonstrations many times. In 1996, Lyttle, David Dellinger, and Abbie Hoffman's son, Andrew, were among ten people arrested for a sit-in at the Chicago Federal Building during the first Democratic National Convention held in Chicago since 1968."

  "text" : "William Neil \"Bill\" Rowe QC (born June 4, 1942) is a former politician, lawyer, broadcaster, and writer in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. He is married to Penelope Ayre Rowe of St. John’s, who is a member of the Order of Canada. They have a son, Dorian, a daughter, Toby, and three grandchildren. Rowe was born in Grand Bank and is the son of the late Liberal Senator Frederick William Rowe and the late Edith Laura Butt. Rowe attended Memorial University of Newfoundland where he earned a Bachelor of Arts. He studied for a Bachelor of Law at the University of New Brunswick on a Sir James Hamet Dunn Scholarship, and went on to become a Rhodes Scholar, graduating with an Honours M.A in Law from the University of Oxford. He entered politics and was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly five times as a Liberal MHA, first at the age of twenty-four. He was appointed, at twenty-six, as a Cabinet Minister in the Government of Joey Smallwood and became responsible for several departments. He was later elected as Leader of the Opposition, holding that position from 1977 to 1979. He resigned his position prior to the 1979 general election, in favour of Don Jamieson, but kept his own seat. One of Rowe's political aides while he was Opposition Leader was a young Brian Tobin. In 1982, Rowe lost his seat in the Newfoundland general election, which saw the Progressive Conservatives under the leadership of Brian Peckford, win by a landslide, taking 44 seats. After leaving politics, Rowe resumed his law practice. As a lawyer, he practiced in St. John's for over three decades, concentrating for years on labour-management arbitrations. During the 1980s he was retained by the federal Minister of National Revenue to conduct a nationwide inquiry into fishermen’s perceived income tax problems with Revenue Canada. Rowe was appointed to Queen's Counsel in 2007. A long-time public affairs commentator, Rowe has appeared regularly on national and local television and radio. He has hosted a daily call-in show on VOCM and CFCB radio for nearly thirty years, which focuses on public issues and is carried throughout the province and around the world. Rowe was instrumental in exposing the Mount Cashel Orphanage scandal when he was host of VOCM's Open Line radio show. Rowe also wrote weekly public affairs columns for St. John's daily newspaper, The Telegram, the Corner Brook Western Star, and other newspapers. In 2004, Premier Danny Williams appointed him Provincial Representative in Ottawa, where he advised the Premier during the crucial negotiations with the Government of Canada that led to the Atlantic Accord, which secured more than two billion dollars for Newfoundland and Labrador. Rowe has written five books: Clapp’s Rock, a best-selling novel published by McClelland & Stewart of Toronto and serialized on CBC Radio; The Temptation of Victor Galanti, a second novel published by McClelland and Stewart; Is That You, Bill?, a volume of essays on politics and public affairs published by Jesperson Press of St. John's; Danny Williams: The War with Ottawa, published in 2010 by Flanker Press; and Danny Williams, Please Come Back, a compilation of his columns and commentaries, published in 2011 by Flanker Press. In 2012, Flanker Press published Rosie O'Dell, a novel whose cover featured a prominent \"Warning: Graphic Content and Mature Subject Matter.\" Rowe is a member of the Writers’ Union of Canada and has served on the executive of the Writers’ Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador. On June 22, 2011, Rowe announced on his radio show his intention to retire from VOCM after nearly thirty years to write full-time. He has agreed to fill in periodically for the regular talk show hosts. His last day as host of his show, BackTalk, was Friday, June 24, 2011. Paddy Daly took over for him on August 1, 2011. On March 8, 2013, Rowe once again took over the hosting duties at VOCM Open Line, a week after the resignation of Open Line host Randy Simms over controversial comments made on-air to Natuashish Innu Band Chief Simeon Tshakapesh."

He was elected to the post of Chief Minister for three five years terms of Assam State, once from Badarpur Constituency and twice from Sonari Constituency. He was in office from December 28, 1957 to November 6, 1970. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1971. During his tenure as the Chief Minister, the Assam Official Language Act, 1960 was enacted, which made Assamese language the sole official language of the state. During his terms the Chinese attacked India at Bomdilla then called NEFE now known as Arunachal Pradesh. He strongly opposed the division of Assam State into smaller states like Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya and was member in various Committees of India's Central Government. Only after his death the State of Assam was broken down into smaller States. The March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising also happened during his tenure. Earlier he was instrumental in promoting the Assam Plantation Act to safeguard the interest of the Tea Tribes of Assam. During his second term as Chief Minister the issue of illegal migration from then East Bengal came up, he claimed there were 300,000 illegal entrants in Assam, and he took active steps to deport them in his third term."

  "text" : "William Patrick \"Bill\" Feldman (born 22 February 1958) is a former Australian politician. Born in Kingaroy, Queensland, Feldman was a police officer before entering politics, having attained the rank of sergeant in 1994. On 7 May 1978 he had married Gail, with whom he has two children, Dannielle and Luke. In 1998, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, representing the seat of Caboolture. He was the parliamentary leader until December 1999, when he led his remaining colleagues out of One Nation to form the City Country Alliance, of which he became leader. His seat was abolished in 2001 and he contested its replacement, Pumicestone, but was defeated by Labor's Carryn Sullivan, whose husband Jon Sullivan Feldman had defeated in Caboolture in 1998. Feldman has not returned to politics. Feldman's son Luke Feldman is a professional cricketer, playing for the Queensland Bulls, Hobart Hurricanes and Sydney Sixers."

  "text" : "Bryan Pape was a senior lecturer at the University of New England, New South Wales, Australia and a former office holder and member of the National Party of Australia,who in Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (April 2009) lost his challenge to the constitutional legality of the Kevin Rudd Government's proposed $7.7 billion tax bonus payments as part of the $42 billion economic stimulus package in the High Court of Australia. A fervent and longtime believer in federalism and state's rights, Pape argued the case himself as a \"concerned lawyer\". He argued that the $900 stimulus payments anticipated to be made to 7.4 million Australians beginning 6 April were not a valid extension of the Commonwealth's taxation powers but a gift, and the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to spend consolidated revenue on gifts under section 81 and 83 of the Australian Constitution. Whilst Pape has disagreed with previous government stimulus packages, he then had no standing to take the Commonwealth to court. The $900 tax rebate is the first that he would be eligible to receive and thus enabled him to take the matter to the high court. While the High Court unanimously rejected the Commonwealth's submission that it could rely on its use of s 81 of the Constitution to support the expenditure, it upheld the Commonwealth's submission that it could do so by relying on the executive power (s.61 of the Constitution] and the incidental power [s.51 (xxxix) of the Constitution] by a thin majority of 4:3. [See (2009) 238 CLR 1] Pape believed that if he were successful, \"the Government could still give the bonus just through... giving a rebate and letting the money flow through the PAYG system.\" Bryan died peacefully at his home in Armidale on Sunday evening, 27 April 2014. His last public act was to officiate at the service that morning at Armidale Anglican cathedral. He died surrounded by the books he was currently reading, one of which was an aid to writing better English. He had always encouraged his law students to aspire to writing simple, elegant straightforward prose. He had fought hard to maintain academic standards, and was a critic of soft marking. He will be remembered as a man of integrity by those who knew and worked with him."

Baxter was a member of the women's national volleyball team at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and was later named the team's head coach in 1979. However, she was fired from that role in 1982 after the media began to report rumours that she was lesbian. Prior to being named coach of the national team, Baxter was a women's volleyball coach at the University of Ottawa, and was named the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union's coach of the year. Baxter was not actually out as lesbian at the time, but subsequently came out and served as a board member of the 1990 Gay Games in Vancouver. She also cofounded the Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women in Sport and the National Coaching School for Women. Baxter subsequently worked as a professional volleyball coach. Baxter ran as a New Democratic Party candidate in Vancouver Centre in the 1993 federal election, in a high-profile race against Prime Minister Kim Campbell, but was not elected. Baxter later was elected as a school trustee in 2011."

On September 5, 2012, he was reappointed to cabinet as Minister of Citizens' Services and Open Government. In the 2011 BC Liberal Party leadership election he endorsed Kevin Falcon; following Christy Clark's victory, she made Stewart government whip. Stewart also served as a member of the cabinet priorities and planning committee and the legislative review committee. After re-election in the 2013 provincial election, he announced on June 5, 2013 resignation of his seat so that Clark, who was defeated in her own riding of Vancouver-Point Grey despite the party's victory provincewide, could contest the seat in a by-election. In October 2013, Premier Clark appointed Stewart as BC Special Representative in Asia, a position based in Beijing."

She was elected in 1981 as a councillor to the Shannon Town Commission. She was re-elected as an Independent after leaving the IRSP. She was later elected to Clare County Council in 1991.

Grummett was defeated in the 1955 general election by Ontario Progressive Conservative Party candidate Wilf Spooner, who was mayor of Timmins, Ontario, when the Liberals failed to field a candidate allowing \"old party votes\" to coalesce around Spooner. The son of a farmer in Maxwell, Ontario, just south of Collingwood, Grummett was the first lawyer in Iroquois Falls-Ansonville, having attended law school in Toronto, Ontario. He and his wife Marie raised their five children in Iroquois Falls, Ontario. He had fought in World War I as an officer in the British Army where he saw action in the Mesopotamian campaign. While there he contracted malaria which affected him for the rest of his life. He died in 1967."

In September 2009, Lambert made national headlines along with fellow Democratic Representative John Hennessy when an Associated Press photograph taken by photographer Jessica Hill depicting them playing solitaire on state-issued laptop computers during a budget hearing at the State Capitol was posted on the Internet. State House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, who was speaking on the Capitol floor at the time, said that the picture \"speaks for itself\" in regard to the legislators' priorities. Lambert retorted that she was \"still listening to [Cafero]\". On March 23, 2010, Lambert announced that she would not seek another term in the General Assembly. She was succeeded by fellow Democrat Kim Rose in January 2011."

He was the son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, the third Proprietor Governor of Maryland (1699–1751), and may have been the grandson of King George I of Great Britain. His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution."

  "text" : "Brian Neal Wightman (born 9 January 1976) is an Australian politician. He is a first generation Tasmanian of Northern Irish descent. His parents William and Mary migrated from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to Tasmania in 1971. Wightman is married to Katie and they have two children, twins William and Beatrix, who were born on Christmas Eve, 2008. He was educated in Launceston, Tasmania and attended Trevallyn Primary School and Riverside High School before graduating from Launceston College in 1993. Brian studied to become a teacher and obtained a Bachelor of Education in 1997 and a Master of Education in 2004, both from the University of Tasmania. Brian is the former Principal of Winnaleah District High School and Branxholm Primary School and was a teacher at Port Dalrymple School in George Town for seven years before being elected in the electorate of Bass at the State election in 2010. Before embarking on his teaching career Brian followed his father into the factory, working each summer holiday from age 15. His Father is a life-member of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and completed 30 years of service at Amcor Fibre Containers. Brian’s first teaching appointment was to George Town at George Town Primary School in 1998. He also taught at Port Dalrymple School, also in George Town, and was principal of Winnaleah District High School and Branxholm Primary School. He is a strong supporter of the Labor Federal Government's Gonski reforms to education and is a proud member of the Australian Education Union. Wightman was first pre-selected as a Labor candidate for the state seat of Bass in the 2010 state election and secured election as the second Labor MP in a close contest with Scott McLean and Beaconsfield Mine collapse survivor Brant Webb. At the 2014 state election he held the following ministerial responsibilities; Attorney General, Minister for Justice, Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage, and Minister for Education and Skills. Wightman was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 2010 being the 5th candidate elected for the seat of Bass. Comparing the results between the 2010  and 2014 state elections Wightman managed to increase his 1st preference vote by more than 2000 votes, even though he lost his seat in 2014 the increased personal vote is significant given there was an 11.2% swing against the Labor party in Bass. After losing his seat at the 2014 Tasmanian State Election Wightman took up the position of Chief Executive of Cornerstone Youth Services which is a Launceston-based community health organisation which delivers services to people aged 12 to 25 in Tasmania's North and North-West. He later took up the position of Tasmanian Executive Director of the Property Council of Australia, commencing this role on 22 September 2014."

  "text" : "Datuk Billy Abit Joo (born 10 May 1949) was the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Hulu Rajang constituency in Sarawak from 1990 to 2013. Billy Abit entered Parliament in the 1990 election, running as an independent. He later joined the Sarawak People's Party (PRS) in the Barisan Nasional coalition. His rural constituency was the largest by area in Malaysia. In 2009, he led a parliamentary delegation into the constituency to enquire into living conditions of the Penan people. He has called for the establishment of forest reserves for the Penans. In 2008, he crossed party lines to be the only government MP to sign a petition for the review of Malaysia's Internal Security Act. Billy Abit's parliamentary career came to an end at the 2013 election, when the PRS nominated Wilson Ugak Kumbong to contest Hulu Rajang."

He was a Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing Armidale from 1978 to 1981, and Northern Tablelands from 1981 to 1987. McCarthy married Thelma on 8 March 1945, with whom he would have three children. He served as a flying officer in the RAAF before becoming a grazier in 1959. From 1970 to 1978 he was a field officer with the Community Development and Extension Division. In 1978, McCarthy was the Labor candidate for the Country Party-held state seat of Armidale; he narrowly defeated sitting MP David Leitch to win the seat. In 1981 the seat was abolished, and McCarthy contested the new seat of Northern Tablelands, which was essentially a merger of the old seats of Armidale and Tenterfield. Although the new seat had a notional National Country Party majority, McCarthy was elected. McCarthy died in 1987 while still the MP; in the resulting by-election, his wife Thelma was defeated by National Party candidate Ray Chappell."

  "text" : "Benjamin Thomas Williams (19 November 1832 – 21 March 1890) was a Welsh barrister and Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1878 to 1882. Williams was the eldest son of T R Williams of Narberth Pembrokeshire, and his wife Mira Thomas daughter of B R Thomas. He was educated at Glasgow University where he was senior prizeman in logic and university medalist in metaphysics. In 1859, he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn and then went on the South Wales and Chester circuits. He was Recorder of Carmarthen from 1872 to 1878 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1875. He was for a while editor of the Law Magazine and was a J.P. for Pembrokeshire, chairman of the South Narbeth School Board, and member of the councils of the University of Glasgow and the University College of Wales. In 1867, Williams sought to be nominated as a candidate for the second seat for Merthyr Boroughs and held a public meeting at Aberdare to support his candidature. He protested against the actions of Thomas Price in using this meeting to promote the candidature of Richard Fothergill. In May 1878 Williams was elected at an unopposed by-election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Carmarthen Boroughs. He was re-elected in 1880 but resigned from Parliament in 1882 to become a County Court judge. Williams died at the age of 57. Williams married Margaret John daughter of T John of Dolemain in 1857."

  "text" : "Bernt Nicole Gilbertson (March 17, 1912 – 1995) was a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Algoma in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1975. He was a member of the Progressive Conservatives. Born in Norway, Gilbertson's family emigrated to Canada and settled on St. Joseph Island in Ontario's Algoma District. He began his working career on the freighters plying the Great Lakes, and later ran a maple syrup business before his election to the legislature, and was known for bringing cans of syrup to the legislature as gifts for his fellow MPPs each spring. He also owned a trucking business and a pancake house. In his riding, he was particularly known for his efforts to have the bridge on Highway 548 built to connect St. Joseph Island to the mainland. The bridge was named in his honour in 1994. In the Legislative Assembly, Gilbertson served as caucus chair and chief government whip, in addition to serving on a variety of standing committees. Gilbertson died in summer 1995 on St. Joseph Island. On October 5, in one of the first sessions of the legislature following the 1995 provincial election, tributes to Gilbertson were delivered in the Assembly by Bud Wildman, Norm Sterling and Mike Brown. Gilbertson's family business, Gilbertson's Maple Syrup Products, is still in operation as the largest producer of maple syrup in Ontario. It is now owned by Gilbertson's son Don."

  "text" : "Brian Campion is an American politician from Bennington, Vermont, in the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 2010, representing the Bennington-2-1 district in Bennington and North Bennington. He took office on January 5, 2011. Born in Albany, New York, he has attended four universities and received two degrees. He attended Springfield College (B.A., 1993), the Université Laval in Quebec, the University of Massachusetts Amherst (M.A., 2001) and the University of Provence in France. An employee of Bennington College's office of external relations, Campion is also a trustee for the Bennington Museum, a commissioner of the Bennington Housing Authority, vice-chair of the Bennington County Democrats, and a director of the Bennington Chamber of Commerce. He ran for state representative in 2010, one of three candidates seeking two seats in the Bennington-2-1 district. Both incumbent state representatives, Democrat Tim Corcoran II and Republican Joseph L. Krawczyk, Jr. were seeking re-election and had endorsed each other. In the general election held on November 2, 2010, Campion won 1,461 votes, finishing behind Corcoran's 1,965 but ahead of Krawczyk's 1,120. He was therefore elected and took office on January 5, 2011. He won re-election in 2012. Campion was elected to the Vermont Senate in 2014. Campion is openly gay; he lives in Bennington with his partner Eric Hatch. He is one of six openly gay members of the Vermont Legislature, alongside representatives Bill Lippert (D–Hinesburg), Herb Russell (D–Rutland), Matt Trieber (D–Bellows Falls) and Joanna E. Cole (D–Burlington), as well as senator Becca Balint (D–Windham)."

Wharton is best known for his March 15, 2009 article entitled \"Obama's No Socialist. I Should Know.\" In it, he sought to debunk right-wing commentators who claimed that President Barack Obama was a secret socialist. Wharton wrote: \"The funny thing is, of course, that socialists know that Barack Obama is not one of us. Not only is he not a socialist, he may in fact not even be a liberal. Socialists understand him more as a hedge-fund Democrat.\" The article led to increased media attention that resulted in multiple appearances on Fox Business News and a series of radio interviews including a segment on the CBC. Since then, Wharton's articles have consistently been published in on-line left-wing publications such as \"Counterpunch,\" the \"MRZine,\" \"Dissident Voice,\" \"In These Times,\" \"Counter Currents\" and \"The Indypendent.\""

  "text" : "Blake James Pedersen (born February 9, 1965) is a Canadian politician who was an elected member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, previously representing the electoral district of Medicine Hat. He was born at Gull Lake, Saskatchewan. He was first elected in the 2012 provincial election as a member of the Wildrose Party caucus. In the spring 2013 sitting of the Alberta Legislature, Pedersen put forward Motion 510 to restore a competitive tax credit system for film industry labour costs, which was supported by the Progressive Conservatives, NDP and Liberals. Motion 510 was the first Wildrose motion to ever pass in the Alberta Legislature. The proposal in Pedersen’s motion would replace the current system of awarding grants to film companies through the Alberta Multimedia Development Fund with a tax credit that would enable all companies to recoup a portion of their production costs. Pedersen was born and raised in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, on the family ranch. Following graduation from Gull Lake High School, he moved to Vancouver as a drummer with a band, but returned to Gull Lake a few months later and entered the work force with a local oilfield services company. Experiencing his first of many boom and bust cycles, after one year of employment Pedersen participated in a 10-month agricultural exchange program to Australia with the International Agricultural Exchange Association. Upon his return to Canada, Pedersen returned to the oilfield services industry, and in 1999 became a small business owner. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Alberta Progressive Conservative caucus. Pederson stood for reelection during the 2015 Alberta election but was defeated by NDP's Bob Wanner, finishing third."

The Gladstone Port Access Bridge was renamed the Bill Prest bridge in 2010. In his last term in the Queensland Parliament, Prest caused controversy when he made a racist slur against former state National Party Aboriginal Affairs Minister and future Federal MP Bob Katter when he called him a gin jockey. Prest however was not publicly disciplined and retained his position as whip but the controversy did see him being taken about out of the limelight of public life. Prest died, aged 86, in Gladstone, Queensland. Robert Schwarten, Liz Cunningham including deputy mayor Matt Burnett and mayor Gail Sellers attended his funeral to pay tribute."

  "text" : "Benjamin Conrad \"Cockie\" Robbins (1857 – 20 January 1953) was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 9 March 1936 to 8 March 1943; and 9 March 1943 to 8 March 1950. Robbins was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, son of Capt. B. Robbins, and educated at the Yarmouth Academy. He arrived in Wellington in 1874, and was a storekeeper in Hawera from 1881. In Hawera he organised a local dairy factory and the National Dairy Association. He was on various local boards; Fire Board (3 years), Hospital Board (chairman 1906-09), and the Wanganui Education Board 1897-1906. His first public service was as a member of the school committee in Hawera for a good decade, where he was chairman for most of that time. He was a member of the Hawera Borough Council for fifteen years and Mayor of Hawera for seven years. Robbins stood in the 1893 election in the Egmont electorate and came second of three candidates. He contested the Hawera electorate in the 1896 and 1905 elections. He came a close second in 1896, and came third in 1905. Robbins moved to Tauranga in 1911, and was Mayor of Tauranga twice, from 1912 to 1915 and 1929 to 1933. He retired from the mayoralty in 1915 and did not contest the election, which was won by Charles MacMillan over John Cuthbert Adams. Robbins stood against the incumbent, William Herries of the Reform Party, in the 1919 election in the Tauranga electorate and was beaten with a margin of over 30% of the vote. He initially declared himself an Independent Progressive Liberal but received the endorsement of Joseph Ward and was the official candidate of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Legislative Council by the First Labour Government. He died in January 1953 aged 96 and is buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery on 18th Avenue in Tauranga. He married in 1877 Jane Anne Ross (died 6 March 1950)."

In 1941 Muse, running as the Republican candidate for Governor of Virginia, lost overwhelmingly to Democrat Colgate Darden, a member of the state's Byrd Organization. Later, Muse lived in Manassas, Virginia, from where he opposed and chronicled the Massive Resistance crisis fostered by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd and Richmond newspaperman James J.

He was the general secretary of All Assam Students Union during 1979-85 and jointly spearheaded the Assam Movement with Prafulla Kumar Mahanta over the issue of Bangladeshi influx. He was one of the four signatories of the Assam Accord of 1985 along with Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. In December 1985, he became Home minister at the age of 29 after the Asom Gana Parishad won the historic Assembly elections. Phukan later fell out with Mahanta and in February 1991 walked out of Asom Gana Parishad to form the Natun Asom Gana Parishad. The two factions united three years later and Phukan was appointed executive president of the Asom Gana Parishad. He quit the Asom Gana Parishad again in 1996 following differences with Mahanta and joined another political party. He was elected for three consecutive terms from the prestigious Jalukbari constituency to the Assam Legislative Assembly from 1985. In 2001, Phukan lost as a Nationalist Congress Party candidate to Himanta Biswa Sarma of the Congress, a student leader whom he had earlier groomed and who joined BJP in 2015. Phukan again returned to the Asom Gana Parishad in 2004 and contested the Lok Sabha (parliament) elections from Guwahati constituency but lost. He died of jaundice on 20 March 2006 in a Delhi hospital."
