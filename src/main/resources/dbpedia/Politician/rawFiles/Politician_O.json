  "text" : "Sir Oliver Mowat, GCMG PC QC (July 22, 1820 – April 19, 1903) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and Liberal Party leader. He served as the third Premier of Ontario for nearly 24 years. He was the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and one of the Fathers of Confederation. He is best known for defending successfully the constitutional rights of the provinces in the face of the centralizing tendency of the national government as represented by his longtime conservative adversary, John A. Macdonald. This longevity and power was due to his astute political maneuvering, in terms of building a political base around Liberals, Catholics, trade unions, and Anglophones distrustful of Quebec."

  "text" : "Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton (August 4, 1823 – November 1, 1877), commonly known as Oliver P. Morton, was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana. He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. During the war, Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln's \"war governors\", Morton made signification contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support. During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery."

  "text" : "Oscar Eduardo Alende (6 July 1909 – 22 December 1996) was an Argentine politician who founded the Intransigent Party. Alende was born in Maipú, Buenos Aires Province. He studied medicine at the University of La Plata, where he led the student union, and completed his medical studies at the University of Buenos Aires in 1933. He became head of gastro-intestinal surgery at Rawson Hospital, and a member of the Argentine Surgical Academy. He was co-founder of the Argentine Committee of Assistance to Republican Spain. In 1948 Alende became a provincial legislator in Buenos Aires Province for the Radical Civic Union (UCR), heading the UCR block from 1950. In 1952 he became a deputy in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, serving until its dissolution in 1955. Alende had joined the breakaway Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI). In 1958 he was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province and served until 1962. Alende became the leader of the UCRI following the 1962 overthrow of President Arturo Frondizi (who broke with the party), and stood as UCRI candidate for President in the 1963 elections. In 1972 he founded the Intransigent Party, the military having banned the use of the name UCRI. He stood once again for President in 1973 on behalf of the Popular Revolutionary Alliance. After the return of democracy in 1983, Alende became president of the Intransigent Party and stood again for President. He was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1985, and served in that capacity until his death in 1996."

  "text" : "Otto Vincent Lange (30 November 1797 – 4 November 1870) was a Norwegian politician. Lange was born in Jevnaker, but moved to Arendal. He worked as a school teacher, and helped found the local library and museum in 1832. In 1833 he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament for the first time. He then changed his civil job to that of surveyor of customs and excise. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1836, 1839, 1842, 1845, 1848, 1851 and 1854, representing the constituency of Arendal og Grimstad. In October 1854 he was appointed Minister of Church and Education, succeeding Jørgen Herman Vogt. In September 1855 he left that succeeded Vogt again, this time as Minister of Finance and Customs. He held this position periodically until June 1863, interrupted by spells as member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm from 1 June 1856 to 31 July 1857, 1 September 1858 to 30 September 1859 and 1 September 1861 to 31 August 1862. Otto Vincent Lange was married to Anne Nicoline Aall (1800–1886), daughter of businessperson, politician and historian Jacob Aall. The Aall family was a notable one; Anne Nicoline Aall's grandfather was businessman Nicolai Benjamin Aall (died 1798) and her uncles were politicians Niels and Jørgen Aall. Also, Otto Vincent Lange had a brother Ulrik Frederik Lange who was an educator and five-term member of Parliament. Otto Vincent's sister Barbara Abigael married Even Hanssen, whose son Johan Jørgen Lange Hanssen married Otto Vincent's daughter Lovise Jacobine. Otto Vincent Lange was proclaimed Knight of the Order of St. Olav 1847, promoted to Commander in 1857, and in 1863 was awarded the Grand Cross in 1863. He was awarded two Swedish orders: the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star and Knight of the Order of Vasa. Lange also held the first class (equivalent to Grand Cross) of the Ottoman Mecidi Order. He died in 1870 in Kristiania and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund."

  "text" : "Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech. A jurist by profession, Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background, growing up at a former crofter's farm in rural Nord-Aurdal, and losing his father in the 1920s. After studying he moved back to Nord-Aurdal, worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region. The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts. He was a proponent of economic regulation, which marked his period as Minister of Finance. However, his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country's overall financial policy. When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance, the ministry regained its dominance, but also set out on a gradual deregulation. This, in addition to Meisdalshagen's discontent with increased spendings on defence, made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party. He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges Kooperative Landsforening, a national association of consumer co-operatives. However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life. He was a part of the \"Easter Uprising\" in 1958, and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel—and policy—in the Labour Party. His death came in this period."

Akesuk was the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the electoral district of South Baffin from 1999 to 2008, having won the seat in the 1999 Nunavut election. He served as the minister of the environment, the minister responsible for the Workers Compensation Board, and the minister responsible for Nunavut housing. In the first elections held in the newly created territory of Nunavut in 1999, Akesuk defeated Goo Arlooktoo, who had been deputy premier of the Northwest Territories, from which Nunavut had been split off. This was considered one of the biggest upsets of the election, as many people had expected Arlooktoo to become premier of Nunavut. On 10 September 2008, Akesuk was appointed Health Minister after Leona Aglukkaq stepped down to run in the 2008 Canadian federal election for the Conservative Party. Akesuk did not stand for re-election in the 2008 territorial election."

  "text" : "Oliver Hampton Smith (October 23, 1794 – March 19, 1859) was a United States Representative and Senator from Indiana. Born on Smith's Island, near Trenton, New Jersey, (is also believed to have been born at the Smith Family Farmstead in Upper Makefield Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania) he attended the common schools and moved west, eventually settling in Lawrenceburg, Indiana in 1818. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1820, commencing practice in Connersville. From 1822 to 1824 he was a member of the Indiana House of Representatives and was prosecuting attorney for the third judicial district, 1824-1825. Smith was elected to the Twentieth Congress (March 4, 1827–March 3, 1829) and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1828; he was then elected as a Whig to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1837, to March 3, 1843. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills (Twenty-sixth Congress) and a member of the Committee on Public Lands (Twenty-seventh Congress). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection and moved to Indianapolis where he resumed the practice of law. He declined to be a candidate for Governor of Indiana in 1845 and engaged in the railroad business in Indianapolis. He died in that city in 1859; interment was in Crown Hill Cemetery."

  "text" : "Oswald Cawley (7 October 1882 – 22 August 1918), styled The Honourable from January 1918, was a British soldier and Liberal Party politician. He was the fourth and youngest son of Frederick Cawley, 1st Baron Cawley and his wife Elizabeth Smith, daughter of John Smith. His older brother was Harold Thomas Cawley. Cawley was educated at Rugby School and New College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. He served as lieutenant of the Shropshire Yeomanry and became a captain of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. He fought in the First World War, where he was killed in action near Merville. Cawley was buried in Néry Communal Cemetery. Shortly before his death in 1918, Cawley had been elected in a by-election in January to succeed his father as Member of Parliament (MP) for Prestwich. It was in memory of Oswald and two other sons - Harold and John - who died in the war that their father endowed a ward at Ancoats Hospital, Manchester, in 1919 at a cost of £10,000. All three brothers are commemorated on the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall. Oswald and Harold, on Panel 8, are among the 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. John, included on the memorial as the son of an MP, appears on Panel 2 of the memorial. Oswald Cawley is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes short biographical accounts of the life and death of the Cawley brothers."

  "text" : "David Owen Evans (5 February 1876 – 11 June 1945) was a Liberal Party politician from Wales. Owen Evans was educated at Llandovery School and the Imperial College of Science. In 1896 he joined the civil service (Inland Revenue Department). Later he read for the Bar and was called to Gray's Inn. He practised law in London until 1916 when he joined the Mond Nickel Company. Rising through the ranks, he eventually became chief administrative officer of the company. He later became vice-president of the International Nickel Company of Canada. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiganshire at a by-election in 1932, following the resignation of the Liberal MP Rhys Hopkin Morris. Evans held the seat until his sudden death, probably of heart failure, shortly before the 1945 general election. His death robbed him of becoming a Knight Bachelor; his appointment had been announced in the Dissolution Honours List published on 7 June 1945 but he died before he could be knighted. In public life in Wales he was a member of the Councils of the University colleges of Aberystwyth and Swansea, treasurer of the college at Aberystwyth and of the National Museum of Wales. He was also a governor and member of the Council of the National Library of Wales."

Russell first came to the Oregon Country in 1834 as a member of Nathaniel J. Wyeth's second expedition. He returned to the country in 1842 with the Elijah White party. He participated in the May 2, 1843 Champoeg Meeting, voting in favor of forming a government. In October of that year he was selected by the First Executive Committee to serve as the supreme judge for the Provisional Government of Oregon and served until May 14, 1844. In 1844, he was elected to the second Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon. He was allied with the group that planned to create an independent Republic of the Pacific and thus was unsuccessful in his run for governor of the Provisional Government in 1845, losing to George Abernethy. Russell eventually went to California. Although not published until well after the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, Osborne's Journal of a Trapper contains an early description of the Lamar Valley or Osborne's Secluded Valley in Yellowstone."

  "text" : "Sir Edward Owen Cox GBE (21 January 1866 – 30 July 1932), known as Owen Cox, was a Welsh-born Australian businessman and politician. Cox was born in South Wales, was educated at Christ's Hospital, and went to sea at the age of fourteen. He left his first ship at Auckland, New Zealand, however, and went into the banking business. After a few years he returned to Britain, but then sailed to Australia and settled in Sydney. He became chairman of Birt & Co and a director of the Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1922. For his war services, Cox was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1918 New Year Honours and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in the Dominion war honours of 1920. Cox died in Monte Carlo, aged 66, after an illness lasting several months."

  "text" : "Olive Crane is a Canadian politician and social worker from Douglas Station, Prince Edward Island. She was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island from 2007 to 2010 on an interim basis and 2010 to 2013 on a permanent basis. She was also leader of the Official Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 2007 to 2010 and 2010 to 2013. On December 5, 2012, Crane announced her resignation as leader of the party effective January 31, 2013. She is a member of the legislature representing District 7 Morell-Mermaid. On September 4, 2007 she was appointed the interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island, serving until her resignation in 2010. She is the fifth woman to serve as leader/interim leader of a PEI political party (after Leone Bagnall, Pat Mella, Catherine Callbeck and Sharon Labchuk). On May 26, 2010, Olive Crane resigned as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island and announced her intentions to seek the permanent leadership. On October 2, 2010, she won the leadership of the PEI Progressive Conservative Party on the second ballot, defeating her main opponent Jamie Ballem. On October 4, 2013 (over eight months after her resignation as PC party leader) Olive Crane was kicked out of the PEI PC Caucus by interim leader, Steven Myers. In an impromptu press conference, Myer's stated “Unfortunately promises were made that were broken yesterday. Olive contradicted a promise that she made to our caucus when she went in the media this morning… if you take it in terms of a hockey coach, you need to know that everybody that’s going on the ice is doing the same job.”  Myer's was referring to an interview Crane made with the Guardian on Thursday, October 3, 2013 on the subject of former Opposition Leader Hal Perry crossing the aisle to the Liberal Party where she believes Perry’s defection was the result of a group of party insiders who tried to oust her as leader last year, resulting in a year of internal struggles that have aired publicly and embarrassingly for the party. Myers says Crane’s interview with The Guardian Thursday broke a promise that was made during a caucus meeting earlier in the day that no MLAs would speak with media following a brief news conference held to offer reaction to Perry’s departure. “We had agreed as a caucus about how we would deal with Hal’s defection,” Myers said.“To have somebody go off on their own and do a private interview… we can’t have stuff like that as a party that is trying to rebuild.”Myers said this has been an ongoing concern with Crane and felt this was the last straw. Crane now sits as an Independent MLA. A native of Morell, Prince Edward Island, Crane is a graduate of Dalhousie University. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island on March 20, 2006 in the by-election for District #2, Morell-Fortune Bay, and re-elected to the Legislature on May 28, 2007 representing District # 7, Morell-Mermaid. Following the 2007 election, she was appointed the Opposition Critic for Health, Education, the Status of Women, and Communities, Cultural Affairs and Labour. She is a career civil servant, working as a social worker for the provincial government since 1979. She has worked in a variety of departments from Health & Social Services, Office of the Attorney General to Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture. Crane hasn't reoffered as a candidate for Morell-Mermaid, in 2015."

  "text" : "Tauveve O’Love Jacobsen is a Niuean politician and diplomat. She is currently Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand, after serving as a member of the Niue Assembly (national Parliament) and a minister in Toke Talagi's government. She was previously a long-standing leading figure in the informal parliamentary Opposition to Young Vivian's government. She was, from 2008 to 2011, Minister of Health, Minister of Public Works, Minister of Women’s Affairs, and Minister in charge of the Niue Power Corporation. She had previously been Minister of Education, Health, Environment, Training and Development. Additionally, Jacobsen is a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and Patroness of the Niuean Volleyball Association. Following the 1999 general election, she was a candidate for the post of Premier (head of government), who is selected by the national Assembly. She lost to Sani Lakatani, of the Niue People's Party, by six votes to fourteen. Following the 2005 general election, Jacobsen was Young Vivian's only opponent contending for the position of Premier. She was defeated by three votes to seventeen. Vivian thanked her for competing against him: \"That the selection was contested, thanks to Ekepule [member of the Assembly] O’love Jacobsen, confirms our determination under the Westminster system of government to adhere and uphold one of the fundamental principles of democracy.\" In February 2008, Jacobsen stated that landowners had been bullied into authorising the building of a hotel and golf course on their land, a project supported by the government and funded by Chinese investors. Premier Young Vivian rejected the allegation. In the lead-up to the 2008 general election, which saw her successfully retain her seat in the Assembly (as a common roll representative, Jacobsen was critical of the fact that several members of the Assembly would be re-elected unopposed. She accused Vivian of discouraging people from taking part in the election as Opposition candidates, and argued that a democracy requires voters being able to choose between several candidates in each constituency. \"If the principle of democracy is going to be upheld, then it is very important that people do need to go to the polls and not have them unopposed and become duly elected.\" Vivian rejected Jacobsen's criticism, and argued in return that candidates were chosen within the villages, in traditional ways. With such a practice, he said, \"there is no conflict, there’s peace and togetherness.\" A government news publication stated with thinly veiled criticism that Jacobsen \"saw herself as a self-appointed backbench champion of the masses\". Following the election, Jacobsen supported Toke Talagi's candidacy to prime ministership, against Vivian, and was appointed to Talagi's small Cabinet. In March 2011, she resigned from government and from the Assembly to be appointed Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand."

  "text" : "Olaf Bjerke (6 January 1893 – 21 September 1957) was a Norwegian trade unionist and politician for the Communist Party. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was arrested on 10 September 1941 after the milk strike. He was imprisoned at Møllergata 19, then in Grini concentration camp, then in Sachsenhausen concentration camp until the end of World War II. The communist inmates formed a caucus in the camp, and Bjerke was among the leading members along with Kristian Mugaas, Johan Strand Johansen, Olaf Skramstad, Halvor Sørum and Erling Heiestad. A railway worker, Bjerke was involved in the trade union Norwegian Union of Railway Workers. As former chairman Ludvik Buland died in a concentration camp in 1945, Bjerke came close to being elected chairman at the national convention later that year, but lost the vote to the Social Democrat Marius Trana. The electoral committee had been unified in its support of Bjerke, but reportedly Haakon Lie and Trygve Bratteli swayed the result in Trana's favor. He did become elected to the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions secretariat, as the only communist. He also entered the Communist Party leadership stratum. Bjerke served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway from Oslo during the term 1954–1957. He died in September 1957."

  "text" : "Osbeorn (died c. 1054), given the nickname Bulax, was the son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). He is one of two known sons — probably the older — of Siward. While it is normally assumed he was the son of Siward's Bamburgh wife Ælfflæd, it has been suggested by William Kapelle that Osbeorn's mother was not Ælfflæd. The nickname \"Bulax\" probably represents the Old Norse term for \"Poleaxe\". According to the most reliable sources, he died at the Battle of the Seven Sleepers, fought somewhere in Scotland between Siward and Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, King of the Scots, in 1054. Under this year, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recension D, related that: \"At this time earl Siward went with a great army into Scotland, with both fleet and a land-force; and fought against the Scots, and put to flight the king Mac Bethad, and slew all that were best in the land, and brought thence much war-spoil, such as no man obtained before;   And there were slain his son Osbeorn, and his sister's son Siward, and some of his housecarls, and also of the king's, on the day of the Seven Sleepers (July 27).\"   This battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, and is known variously as the \"Battle of the Seven Sleepers\" or the \"Battle of Dunsinane\". The location Dunsinane is not accepted as historical by modern historians, resting as it does on later medieval accounts. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle being the early 15th-century account by Andrew of Wyntoun. In recension C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the names of the slain are omitted, an omission repeated by the Chronicle of John of Worcester. Henry of Huntingdon related that Osbeorn had been sent to Scotland ahead of Siward:\"[Siward] sent his son to acquire Scotland. And when they reported to his father that he had been slain in battle, [Siward] said, 'Did he receive the mortal wound in front of his body, or behind?' The messengers said. 'In front'. And he replied: 'I rejoice wholly, for I would deem myself or my son worthy of no meaner death'. Siward therefore marched into Scotland and conquered the king battle ... \" Another legendary account, in the Vita et Passio Waldevi, a hagiography of Osbeorn's brother Waltheof, claimed that Osbeorn, called \"Osbert Bulax\", was killed by Northumbrians while his father was absent in Scotland. The accounts in Henry of Huntingdon and the Vita et Passio Waldevi are thought to be derived from a saga devoted to the life of Earl Siward. Geoffrey Gaimar's account related activity in 1053, an agreement made between Siward and Mac Bethad, but a death of Osbeorn is not mentioned. Osbeorn's death left Siward's legacy in danger. When he died the following year, his only son Waltheof was underage and thus did not succeed immediately to the whole territory ruled by Siward, Northumbria going instead to Tostig Godwinson."

He represented Shellbrook from 1934 to 1944 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Liberal. He was born in Ham-Nord, Quebec, the son of Alfred Demers and Rose Anna Dufresne, and was educated in Victoriaville. In 1912, his father and mother moved to Debden, Saskatchewan; they were one of the first families to settle in the area. They convinced Omer and his brother Adelbert to move to Debden. The two brothers arrived with a boxcar full of supplies and, soon after arriving, built a store which included living quarters. In 1914, Omer married Lucienne Larose. With his business going well, he soon built a larger store and residence. Demers helped open the first school in the town in 1915 and helped establish a Catholic parish. He also served as postmaster from 1912 to 1919. In 1920, Demers became the first mayor of Debden. He sold the store after his wife developed tuberculosis. After she recovered, she opened a women's clothing store in Debden. Demers took up ranching and then muskrat ranching; both ventures were not successful. He was defeated by Albert Victor Sterling when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1944. In 1945, Demers moved to British Columbia. He died in Esquimalt at the age of 75."

In the 2013 election, Othman ran for the UMNO-held federal seat of Jerlun. Jerlun was being vacated by Mukhriz Mahathir, who was seeking to move to state politics to become Kedah's Chief Minister. Othman defeated PAS's Ismail Salleh by 3,270 votes, winning election to the federal parliament."
