He was also a noted opponent of the far-right and the far-left, i.e. the Nazi Party and the Communist Party of Germany, during the Weimar Republic, and is famous for his description of the communists as \"red-painted Nazis.\" He spent over ten years in Nazi concentration camps, where he was severely mistreated."

  "text" : "Kazimierz Władysław Bartel (Polish pronunciation: [kaˈʑimjɛʂ vwaˈdɨswaf ˈbartɛl], English: Casimir Bartel; 3 March 1882 – 26 July 1941) was a Polish mathematician, scholar, diplomat and politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland three times between 1926 and 1930 and the Senator of Poland from 1937 until the outbreak of World War II. Bartel was appointed Minister of Railways between 1919 and 1920, in 1922–1930 he was a member of Poland's Sejm. After Józef Piłsudski's May Coup d'état in 1926, he became prime minister and held this post during three broken tenures: 1926, 1928–29, 1929–1930. Bartel was the Deputy Prime Minister between 1926–1928 and Minister of Religious Beliefs and Public Enlightenment, when Piłsudski himself assumed the premiership, however, Bartel was in fact \"de facto\" prime minister during this period as Piłsudski did not concern himself with the day-to-day functions of the cabinet and the government. In 1930 upon giving up politics, he returned to the university as professor of mathematics. In 1930 he became rector of the Lwów Polytechnic and was soon awarded an honorary doctorate and membership in the Polish Mathematical Association. In 1937 he was appointed the Senator of Poland and held this post until World War II. After the Invasion of Poland by the Soviets and subsequent occupation, he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical Institute. In 1940 he was summoned to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament. Following Operation Barbarossa, on 30 June 1941 the German Wehrmacht entered Lwów and began the persecution of the local intelligentsia. Bartel was imprisoned by the Gestapo two days later and offered to create a Polish puppet government with himself as the head. His eventual refusal of accepting the terms imposed by the occupant was considered as an act of treason against the German authorities. By the order of Heinrich Himmler Bartel was murdered on 26 July 1941, shortly after the Massacre of Lwów professors had ended."

  "text" : "Kenneth Sweigard (September 21, 1919 – July 11, 2005) was a Pentecostal evangelist from Grande Prairie, Alberta, and politician who led the Social Credit Party of Canada from 1983 to 1986. In the 1980 election, Social Credit's five remaining Members of Parliament (all from Quebec) were defeated. The party had not had any MPs from its old base of Alberta and British Columbia since 1968. Sweigard first ran as a Social Credit candidate in the 1980 federal election. Standing in Peace River, Alberta, he came in fifth place with 462 votes. He placed behind the three major parties and the candidate for the Rhinoceros Party of Canada. Sweigard first sought the party’s leadership in 1982, when he lost to Martin Hattersley. Sweigard attended the party's leadership convention dressed as U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, wearing a top hat and carrying a walking stick. His entourage, dressed in 1860s style, held placards reading \"Free the Slaves\" and chanted \"Free the economic slaves\", a reference to the social credit theory of monetary reform and opposition to the charging of interest on borrowed money. Hattersley resigned as leader in June 1983 when the party would not expel three outspoken party members from Alberta, including Jim Keegstra who had been accused of anti-Semitism. Sweigard, who described Keegstra as a \"fine Christian gentleman\", was elected interim leader by means of a telephone conference call of 17 party members, with 9 votes to 5 votes for party vice-president Richard Lawrence and three for Adrien Lambert. As leader, he ran in the 1984 election in Timiskaming, placing last with 151 votes. Nationally, under his leadership, the party suffered what was, at the time, its worst performance to date receiving only 16,659 votes nationwide. Sweigard attempted to win the leadership on a permanent basis at the party's national convention in 1986 but fared poorly, despite telling delegates that he had been visited by an angel who had endorsed his candidacy. Sweigard received only 9 of 114 votes, finishing well behind winning candidate Harvey Lainson and runner-up Jim Keegstra. After losing the leadership, he ran again in the 1988 election in Peace River, where he came in last in a field of six candidates with 354 votes. He died at Grande Prairie in 2005."

  "text" : "(In this Indian name, the name Ram Singh is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Karpal Singh.)(This article is about the Malaysian politician and lawyer. For the seaside promenade in Penang, see Karpal Singh Drive.)\nKarpal Singh s/o Ram Singh (28 June 1940 – 17 April 2014) (Punjabi: ਕਰਪਾਲ ਸਿੰਘ ) was a Malaysian lawyer and politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bukit Gelugor in the state of Penang since 2004. He was the former National Chairman of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), a position that he assumed in 2004. Born in Penang to an Indian Punjabi immigrant father, Karpal read law at the National University of Singapore. He was one of Malaysia's most prominent lawyers, and took up numerous high-profile cases, including drug trafficking charges against foreign nationals, and sodomy accusations against former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. Karpal was a staunch opponent of the death penalty, especially in relation to drug trafficking offences. In both courtrooms and parliament, he was known as a controversial figure. He was suspended from parliament numerous times, charged for sedition, and had been detained under Malaysia's internal security laws. His reputation as a lawyer and opposition politician earned him the nickname \"the Tiger of Jelutong\". Karpal's political career began in 1970 when he joined the DAP. He won a seat in the Kedah State Legislative Assembly in 1974. He was first elected to parliament in 1978 as the representative for Jelutong, Penang, and held the seat for more than 20 years until losing it in 1999. He returned to parliament in the next general election, and led the DAP to its strongest ever performance in the 2008 general election. A motor vehicle accident in 2005 left Karpal using a wheelchair and with neuromotor problems in his right arm. Despite this, he continued his legal and political careers. Karpal Singh died on 17 April 2014 after being involved in another motor vehicle accident. It was believed that the 73-year-old Bukit Gelugor MP was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Penang to attend a court hearing later in the morning when the accident occurred."

  "text" : "Karl Friedrich von Savigny (19 September 1814 – 11 February 1875) was a Prussian diplomat, politician, and a leading member of the Centre Party. His father was the jurist Friedrich Karl von Savigny, who was then privy councillor of the court of appeals, member of the Prussian council of State, and professor at the University of Berlin, and his mother was Kunigunde Brentano, sister of the poet Clemens Brentano. The father was a Protestant, but the mother was a Catholic, and the children were allowed to follow the religion of the mother. Karl Friedrich was first taught at home, then attended the French Gymnasium at Berlin, the Collegium Romanum at Rome, and the Collegium Sebastianum at Naples. He studied law at Berlin, Munich, and Paris. In 1836 he became an auscultator at Berlin; in 1837 he was a referendar in the court at Aachen, in 1840 secretary of legation at London and Dresden, in 1842 at Lisbon, in 1848 at London. In 1849 he was councillor of legations and member of the ministry of foreign affairs, and in 1850 ambassador at Karlsruhe. While here he was able to win over the Government of Baden for the Prussian policy, and, as Bismarck testified, \"by cautious and tactful bearing to win a commanding position at Karlsruhe for the Prussian government.\" From 1859 Karl Friedrich was Prussian ambassador at Dresden, from 1862 at Brussels, and from 1864 he was minister with full powers at the Diet of the German Confederation at Frankfort. In 1866 he offered at the Diet the Prussian motion for the reform of the German Confederation, and when it was rejected on 14 June, 1866, he declared the withdrawal of Prussia, upon which the Austro-Prussian war began. Later in connection with Bismarck he was plenipotentiary in making a treaty of peace with the states of southern Germany and Saxony. He was the presiding officer of the government conferences for the drafting of a constitution for the North German Confederation, and was a plenipotentiary at the Reichstag which decided the constitution. Thus he performed important services in national affairs. In 1868 he retired partially, and in 1871 entirely, from government positions in order to become one of the parliamentary leaders of the Catholics. From 1867 he was a member of the Lower House of the Prussian Diet, from 1868 a member of the Lower House of the Diet of the North German Confederation, and later of the German Reichstag, or Parliament of the German Empire. In 1871 he took part in the founding of the Centre Party. He was not particularly distinguished as a speaker, but his knowledge, distinguished personality, and connections were of much benefit to the Catholic cause. He believed that \"laws are not made but found\"."

  "text" : "Kris Hanna (born 1962) is an Australian politician, and former member for Mitchell in the South Australian House of Assembly from 1997 until 2010. Originally elected as a member of the Australian Labor Party, Hanna joined the SA Greens in 2003 before becoming an independent member in 2006. Before entering Parliament, Hanna practised law. He also served as a Councillor for the City of Marion from 1995 to 1997. He returned to practicing law in 2010 and, in 2014 was elected unopposed as Mayor of the City of Marion. Hanna is currently on the Board of Victim Support Service, and is Patron of numerous local sporting clubs. He was the longest-serving member of the Seaview High School Governing Council and had been President of Friends of Glenthorne and the Reynella Business & Tourism Association. While initially elected at the 1997 and 2002 elections as a member of the Labor Party, he moved to the Greens in early 2003. He ultimately resigned from the Greens on 8 February 2006 and ran in the 2006 election as an independent and won. His chances of retaining his seat in 2006 had been essentially written off by most commentators after his decision to become an Independent MP, but he won a narrow victory after a very low Liberal primary vote and an endorsement from popular Independent MP Nick Xenophon. He narrowly lost at the 2010 election despite an improved vote, due to finishing third after all non-major party preferences had been distributed. Hanna sought to have his 2010 election loss overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, saying he fell victim to \"misleading and defamatory\" leaflets and posters distributed by the Labor Party. The court ruled the leaflets - labelling Hanna \"soft on crime\" - were defamatory and not factual, yet there was a right to express such opinions. The court dismissed Hanna's case. Hanna unsuccessfully re-contested the seat of Mitchell at the 2014 election. Some of the local issues Hanna was known to campaign for were: upgrading the Oaklands rail crossing, making Glenthorne a forested recreational park, and turning the old O’Halloran Hill TAFE site into a high school."

  "text" : "Karl Albert Staaff (21 January 1860 – 4 October 1915) was a Swedish liberal politician and lawyer. He was chairman of the Liberal Coalition Party (1907–1915) and served twice as Prime Minister of Sweden (1905–1906 and 1911–1914). Staaff was active in the Swedish movement for universal suffrage, and as the Liberal party's Prime Minister he presided in 1905 over an attempt to introduce universal and equal suffrage for men. His successor as party leader, Nils Edén, eventually managed to carry this further into universal suffrage in 1918–19, including for women. Due to conservative intervention, Staaff's proposal for first past the post was ultimately scrapped for a proportional system. In 1912, the period of leave that women were allowed following a child’s birth was extended to 6 weeks, and in 1913 a tax-financed pension scheme was introduced. Staaff ran into sharp conflict with the conservative Swedish establishment, and became a hated figure in the Conservative, pro-Monarchic and anti-Democratic establishment. An intense smear campaign was launched against him, picturing him as the destroyer of Swedish tradition and society: wealthy Stockholmers could even buy ash-trays shaped as his head. His staunch anti-military politics created the greatest fundraising in the Swedish history until that time, the 12 M kronor coastal battleship HMS Sverige where the funds where raised in a few months in 1912. Staaff had to bite the lemon, and the ship was ordered. In 1914 Staaff stepped down from government in protest, after Conservatives had summoned a farmers' demonstration at the Royal castle's court in Stockholm, where King Gustaf V – who according to the law was supposed to stay out of politics – denounced Staaff's defence policies. The contemporary Swedish Liberal party The Liberals counts him as the first among the more prominent leaders of Swedish 20th century liberalism, followed by such parliamentarians as Nils Edén, Carl Ekman, Nobel Prize laureate Bertil Ohlin, Gunnar Helén, Per Ahlmark and Bengt Westerberg."

  "text" : "Baron Clas Eriksson Fleming (Finnish: Klaus Fleming) (1535, Pargas, Sweden (now Finland); 13 April 1597, Pohja, Sweden (now Finland)) was a Finnish-born member of the Swedish nobility and admiral, who played an important role in Finnish and Swedish history during the rise of Sweden as a Great Power. He was a trustee of Swedish kings John III and Sigismund Vasa. In 1569 Fleming became a member of the Privy Council, in 1571 he was made Lord High Admiral and in 1590 Lord High Constable. As the Governor of Finland and Estonia he carried the duties of the highest authority of Finland and Estonia for the Swedish realm, next only to the king of Sweden. He was a strong supporter of the legitimate king of Sweden Sigismund Vasa and therefore an enemy of Sigismund's paternal uncle, duke Charles of Sudermania, who had also laid claim to the Swedish throne. Fleming's father – a grandson of Björn Ragvaldsson – was the Councilor of State Erik Fleming (1487–1548), also a remarkable man and King Gustav Vasa's favourite. Fleming's sons were executed in the Åbo Bloodbath of 1599. When studying Swedish history of the time it is noteworthy to know there were many persons in similar position with the name Clas Fleming at the time. Clas Eriksson Flemming should not be confused with Claes Larsson Fleming (1592–1644), admiral and advisor to the king, or Klas Fleming (1649–1685), nobleman and politician."

  "text" : "Karl Jaffary (born 1936) is a Canadian former municipal politician in Toronto, Ontario. Jaffary was born in New Orleans and moved to Toronto with his family in 1940. He went to school in Toronto and attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute and University of Toronto Schools. He went to the University of Toronto and graduated from the Faculty of Law. He practised with Blake, Cassels & Graydon before starting his own firm in 1968. After several years of practice at Houser Henry Loudon and Syron, Jaffary joined Gowlings in 1992 before continuing his municipal planning law practice as a sole practitioner near the turn of the century. Jaffary was active with the federal New Democratic Party and served as vice-president from 1969 to 1973. Jaffary became active in local politics in 1968 when he became president of the Ward 2 Residents' Association in the Cabbagetown area. The association fought the city's plans to tear down housing for urban renewal. In the 1960s, Cabbagetown was a run down area of town. Since then many of the houses have been renovated and the neighbourhood is now gentrified and upscale. Jaffary ran for Toronto City Council and became alderman for Ward 7 in 1969. As senior alderman, he sat on both the city and Metro Toronto councils. He was re-elected in 1972 but decided not to run in the 1974 election. During his tenure, he was active in the reform wing of city council along with John Sewell. He was interested in civic organization and administration and became involved in city housing policy."

Appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (1956), and awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Sydney (1952), Sir Kenneth became lieutenant-governor and administered the State several times. Farewelled in court in December 1959, he retired from the bench on his seventieth birthday. In 1951 he was appointed a knight of grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. He married Jessie Street, social reformer. They had four children including Sir Laurence Street who also attained the position of Chief Justice. His daughter Philippa married the Australian Test cricketer and journalist Jack Fingleton. Street died on 15 February 1972 and was accorded a state funeral. His youngest son Sir Laurence achieved in 1974 the rare distinction of occupying the same office of chief justice as had his father and grandfather."

  "text" : "Kenneth Marks (15 June 1920 – 13 January 1988) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. Marks was Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester Gorton from a 1967 by-election to 1983. From 1975 to 1979, he was a junior Environment minister. Before his by-election success he served as a Labour councillor on the Denton Urban District Council, representing Denton West. Although reselected to fight Manchester Gorton at the 1983 general election, boundary changes substantially altered the constituency boundaries, with the largest part of the constituency, Denton and Audenshaw in Tameside Metropolitan Borough, merging with Reddish in Stockport Metropolitan Borough to form a new Denton and Reddish constituency. Gorton was included with much of the former Manchester Ardwick constituency, which was renamed Manchester Gorton. As there were potentially three Labour MPs contesting two new seats, Marks, who was the senior of the three, stood down, allowing Stockport North's Andrew Bennett to inherit Denton and Reddish and Gerald Kaufman to move across from Ardwick to the new Gorton seat."

  "text" : "Karl Rudolf Friedenthal (September 15, 1827 – March 7, 1890) was a Prussian statesman. Friedenthal was born in Breslau (Wrocław), Prussian Silesia, as a nephew of Markus Bär Friedenthal, the author, and later became a convert to Christianity (1832). He attended the gymnasium at Neisse (1839–44), studied law at Breslau, Heidelberg, and Berlin, and became (1854) Kammergerichtsassessor. He also made himself practically acquainted with agriculture in the management of his property. In 1856 Friedenthal was elected district deputy from Neisse (Nysa), and in 1857 deputy to the Prussian Landtag. In 1860 he published the pamphlet \"Salus Publica Suprema Lex,\" urging the reorganization of the army. Elected to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation in 1867, he joined the \"Altliberalen,\" but after the following election he became a Free Conservative. Successively member of the Zollparlament and of the imperial Reichstag, Friedenthal was prominent in the proposal and passage of many bills. During the Franco-Prussian War he took part, on Otto von Bismarck's invitation, with Moritz Karl Henning von Blanckenburg and Rudolf von Bennigsen in the deliberations at Versailles on the constitution of the German Empire. He was elected to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in 1870, and became in 1873-74 its second vice-president. In 1874 he was appointed minister of agriculture; and in 1879 the Department of Domains and Forests, till then under the minister of finance, was put in his charge. From October 1877 to March 1878, during the absence of Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg, he was head of the Ministry of the Interior. In 1879, being unable to accept Bismarck's new economical policy, he resigned, declining a patent of nobility. In the same year he was elected member of the Upper House, but in 1881 resigned, and retired to the management of his estate, Giesmannsdorf, near Neisse. Besides his doctor dissertation, \"De Rerum Litigiosarum Alienatione ex Jure Romano\" (1845), Friedenthal published \"Reichstag und Zollparlament\""

  "text" : "Kevin Yates is a Canadian politician, who served as an MLA in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1999 to 2011, for the constituency of Regina Dewdney. Born February 17, 1963 in Carmichael, Saskatchewan, he moved to Regina in 1983. Before Yates was elected the MLA for Regina Dewdney he was employed by the Saskatchewan provincial government as a social worker and corrections worker for 15 years. He was the chief negotiator for the public service bargaining unit of SGEU for six years. Yates was first elected to the Saskatchewan Legislature in a 1999 by-election for Regina Dewdney. He was re-elected in 2003. In 2006 Yates was named to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Corrections and Public Safety and Deputy Government House Leader. On September 15, 2006, Yates stepped down from his position as the Minister of Corrections and Public Safety for \"personal reasons\", which he declined to name, beyond explaining that he was not stepping down for health-related issues. Some media sources, along with Saskatchewan Party Opposition Leader Brad Wall, speculated that his \"resignation\" was the result of insubordination to Saskatchewan Premier Lorne Calvert. Following a May 31, 2007 cabinet shuffle, Yates returned to cabinet as Minister of Community Resources and Minister Responsible for Disability Issues."

The member being Karpal Singh who is from the opposition Democratic Action Party. To top it up, he is one of the seven member of parliaments from the MIC, making him a minority within a minority. Growing up, Nijhar recollects the times he had to stay in a kampung house without any basic amenities and had to depend on wells for water, and Hindu temples for free meals because of poverty. While a student at St Xavier's Institution in Penang, he used to earn money as a ball boy at clubs with tennis courts. But this did not stop him from excelling in school. He topped the school examinations between 1947 and 1954. “My passion to serve the community exceeds my desire to make money in the business world,” he said, adding that he had saved the Selangor MIC building from being auctioned off, and had also refinanced two of his cars to organise a national economic congress in 1980. In the Malaysian parliament, he sits on the Public Accounts Committee. He had also served on the National Unity Committee. Nijhar was dropped as a candidate for the 2008 general elections. The Barisan Nasional candidate for the constituency, S. Murugeson was defeated by the candidate from the Justice Party, Sivarasa Rasiah."

  "text" : "Andre Kasongo Ilunga (allegedly born 20 October 1972) was identified as the Vice-President of the UNAFEC party and Minister for Foreign Trade of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite doubts being cast on whether or not he actually exists as a real person. Although a member of the UNAFEC party selected by Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga, he failed to appear at the opening of the new Government, and never claimed his office. As a result, Kasongo Ilunga is now considered by the local media and the international community to have been an imaginary person, most likely created by Kisimba Ngoy, leader of the UNAFEC party, as a part of a plan to win the lucrative role for himself. Under government rules, a party must provide a shortlist of at least two candidates for any ministerial role, with the Prime Minister making the final choice from the list. The only two candidates put forward for the Foreign Trade post were Kasongo Ilunga and Kisimba Ngoy, with the list being compiled by Kisimba himself. However, Kisimba had been a vocal supporter of Mobutu Sese Seko, someone whom Antoine Gizenga had once strongly opposed, likely causing him to choose the unknown Ilunga over Kisimba. Kisimba denied these charges, claiming that Ilunga later declined the role for personal reasons, and that he had sent a signed letter to the Prime Minister tendering his resignation. Despite this, Gizenga refused to accept the resignation unless Ilunga resigned in person. Kasongo Ilunga is a common name in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and at least three people claimed to be him. However, all of these people were denounced as impostors, as none of them had the correct background. The event damaged the reputation of the government, the first to be democratically elected in over 40 years, leading to the dismissal of Kisimba from the UNAFEC and the emergency election of a new party president."

She voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty and sided with Éamon de Valera. She was re-elected at the 1922 general election, this time as an Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin TD. In accordance with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy of the time, she did not take her seat in the 3rd Dáil. She lost her seat at the 1923 general election."

  "text" : "K. Parthiban is a Malaysian politician of Indian (specifically Tamil) descent. He is a member of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), a component party of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, and has been the party's Tanjung Karang division secretary since 2002. In 2003, he was appointed as a special officer to the incumbent Tanjung Karang MP, Datuk Noh Omar. Parthiban was born in Ladang Raja Musa, Kuala Selangor district, Selangor. He attended the Seri Kota Teachers' Training College in Kuala Lumpur before enrolling in the University of Malaya, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree and later a Master of Education (M.Ed.) in Education Management. Parthiban was as a teacher from 1994 to 2006 at various schools in Tanjung Karang and Kuala Selangor prior to entering politics. On 16 April 2007, despite being a relative novice in politics, Parthiban was chosen as the BN candidate in the 2007 Ijok by-election. Parthiban eventually defeated Khalid Ibrahim of Parti Keadilan Rakyat in a straight fight. In the 2008 Malaysian general elections, K. Parthiban contested in the N10 Bukit Melawati, Selangor State Legislative Assembly and eventually lost to Muthiah a/l Maria Pillay from Parti KeADILan Rakyat by a slim majority of 297 votes."

As Minister for Agriculture 1957-1964, he had only limited success in resisting the pressure for structural development of the sector resulting in the abandonment of many small farms. Back then small farmers constituted an important part of the Social Liberal electorate. As party leader, Skytte was eventually sidelined by Hilmar Baunsgaard who had a much stronger TV appeal. When the latter formed his cabinet in 1968, Skytte became Speaker of Folketinget. He retired from Danish politics in 1978."

  "text" : "Kevin Joseph Moss (born 1 February 1946) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1986 to 2003, representing the electorate of Canterbury. Moss was born in Sydney, and was educated at St Pauls Convent School in Dulwich Hill and St Patrick's Church Hill. He was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1973, and served as deputy mayor in 1976 and 1979 before being elected by his colleagues as mayor in 1980. He served as mayor until the year after his election to parliament, and was employed as a staffer at the party's head office during his period. Moss won Labor preselection to contest the state seat of Canterbury in 1986 when the appointment of former Labor minister Kevin Stewart as the state's Agent-General in London created the need for a by-election. Canterbury was considered a safe seat for the Labor Party, and Moss was elected with over 53% of the primary vote. He was re-elected four times as the member for Canterbury, and served as a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr government. Moss retired at the 2003 election, and was succeeded by Labor member Linda Burney."

  "text" : "Koji Kakizawa (柿澤 弘治 Kakizawa Kōji, November 26, 1933 - January 27, 2009) was a Japanese politician who served as Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1994. After his death, he had been conferred as Junior Third Rank, Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. After graduating from the University of Tokyo, Faculty of Economics, Kakizawa worked as a bureaucrat within the Ministry of Finance before entering politics. During his enrollment in the ministry, Kakizawa was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Economic Planning Agency. He was first elected to the House of Councillors in 1977 as a member of the New Liberal Club (NLC), which is now defunct. He moved to the House of Representatives of Japan beginning in 1980. Kakizawa then left the NLC in order to join the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In 1994, Kakizawa defected from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in order to help found the now defunct Liberal Party that same year. He held the post of Foreign Minister of Japan for about two months in 1994 within the coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hata's government had excluded the LDP from power. Kakizawa rejoined the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 1995. Kakizawa unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Tokyo in the 1999 election after being expelled from the LDP. He continued to serve a total of seven terms within the Japanese House of Representatives until his retirement in 2003. Koji Kakizawa died of esophagus cancer on January 27, 2009, at the age of 75 at a hospital in Tokyo. His son Mito Kakizawa became a member of the Diet later that year."

First elected in 1989, he was the head of the Parliamentary Criminal Justice Commission, and then was promoted to cabinet, in a junior ministerial role in Emergency Services and Consumer Affairs. A close race in the 1995 state election resulted in him winning by just 16 votes. The result was overturned by the Court of Disputed Returns on 8 December 1995, and Davies, running as an Independent after being disendorsed by the ALP, lost in the subsequent by-election. From 1998 to 2005 he served as general manager of the Kyogle Council in northern New South Wales. but was dismissed from the role after being criticised for living in Brisbane and commuting to Kyogle."

  "text" : "Raja Bahadur Kamakhya Narain Singh (10 August 1916 – 1970) of Ramgarh, Jharkhand was the zamindar of Ramgarh Raj and later a politician. He was educated at Rajkumar College, Raipur and at Mayo College, Ajmer. He became the Raja of Ramgarh in 1919 upon death of his father, Raja Lakshmi Narain Singh. He served as the Vice-President of the Bihar Landholder's Association and the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha. He was also Member of the Managing Committee and General Council of Rajkumar College; Member of the Executive Body of the Bihar War Committee. He served as president of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha in 1943 and 1953. He was married to Maharani Lalita Rajya Lakshmi Devi, daughter of Supradipta Manyabara Lt.Gen. Maharajkumar Singha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal in 1936. They had a son, Indra Jitendra Narain Singh. He entered politics in 1946 following the formal accession of the Ramgarh state into the Indian Republic. In 1952 Bihar Assembly elections, he contested from Dhanbad as a candidate of Swatantra Party but was defeated by a noted freedom-fighter and labor rights leader, Purushottam K. Chauhan. Later in the Bihar Assembly Elections of 1967, serious opposition was offered by the Raja Bahadur's Swatantra Party to the ruling Congress government. The Raja Bahadur and his younger brother, Dr. Basant Narayan Singh, became Cabinet Ministers in the government headed by Chief Minister of Bihar, Mahamaya Prasad Sinha. He resigned from the party because he was not made the Deputy Chief Minister. In late 1960s, Kamakhya Narayan Singh was popularly an aspirant for Rajput supremacy in Bihar against Rajput stalwart, Sri Satyendra Narain Singh (then known as \"Coming Chief Minister of Bihar\") but was outmanoeuvred. His party later merged with the Janata party. Many of his family members became important political functionaries and legislators."

Sacilotto owned Professionals Darwin and had worked in Residential & Commercial real estate prior to her political career, and was also Vice President of the REINT. Sacilotto was one of the surprise victors of Labor's 2005 landslide election win, defeating the Country Liberal Party incumbent Sue Carter. Although Carter had suffered a 10-point swing in 2001, there was little hint that she was in any serious danger of losing what had long been the safest CLP seat in Darwin. However, in a shock result, the count remained on a knife-edge for several days after the election. On the final count, Sacilotto unseated Carter by 73 votes on a swing of 8.4 percent, just barely enough to take the seat off the CLP. She served one term in the Assembly before John Elferink regained Port Darwin for the CLP."

In March 1997, Anwer was elected as a member of the Senate of Pakistan for a term of six years. Anwer has an experience of thirty eight years as a court advocate and legal expert and argues cases relating to constitutional matters in the Supreme Court, as well as commercial issues. In 1993, he played an instrumental role in persuading the Supreme Court to restore the deposed federal government back into office and in 1996, convinced the Supreme Court that the previous government's dismissal was lawful. While in office as the law minister, he sought assistance of the Asian Development Bank for a complete re-haul of Pakistan's entire legal system. Currently, he runs a Karachi-based law firm called Khalid Anwer & Co."

He was a member of Lok Sabha from Domariyaganj, Uttar Pradesh.Founder of ONGC, Shri KD Malaviya ji is beyond a shadow of any doubt, the unqualified father of the hydrocarbon sector of this country.Undeterred by strong western skepticism about the viability or, even the potential, of the country’s hydrocarbon capabilities which was largely a propaganda driven by the western oil companies, Mr. Malaviya, the original one among the rich lineage of visionaries of the country’s oil & gas industry of which there has been quite a few, was undaunted in his vision and unrelenting in his pursuit of a country that was energy-secure.However, with support from Jawaharlal Nehru, Malaviya launched a crusade for the formation of a national oil company with formation of ONGC in 1956. In fact, most of what Mr. Malaviya achieved, with the unstinted support of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, in those early days of Nehru’s national project of modernizing the nation and making it industrially competent has, over the years, provided and continues to provide a strong foundation to the economic success story that India is today. His commitment to India's progress for gaining self-reliance in energy sector was a shining example of the patriotism for the younger generation and a source of strength to the scientific community. Clear in his thoughts and supremely purposeful in his action, he was an inspiration for the younger generation of that era to come together in the hunt to find oil and secure the country’s future."

  "text" : "Kathleen D'Olier Courtney was born the youngest of five daughters and the fifth of seven children of Lieutenant (later Major) David Charles Courtney (1845-1909) of the Royal Engineers (a native of Milltown, County Dublin, Ireland), and his wife, Alice Margaret (née Mann) at 1 York Terrace, was born in Gillingham on 11 March 1878. Courtney attended and became educated at the private the Anglo-French College in Kensington and the Manse boarding-school in Malvern before spending seven months in Dresden studying the German language. In January 1897 she went to Lady Margaret Hall to study modern languages. The Courtney family were extremely wealthy and never had to worry about finances and in that case, she decided to devote her life to good causes where she was able to help people. In 1908 she was appointed secretary of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. One of its members, Helena Swanwick, later revealed that Courtney arrived in Manchester \"with a big reputation\" as an outstanding organizer. In 1911 she moved to London where she worked closely with Millicent Fawcett, an English feminist, intellectual, political and union leader, and writer as honorary secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. A suffragist and Honorary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she abandoned her active campaigning for women's suffrage and devoted her life to studying international politics and trying to build bridges towards international cooperation. In April 1915, Aletta Jacobs, a suffragist in the Netherlands, invited suffrage members all over the world to an International Congress of Women in The Hague. Some of the women who attended included Kathleen Courtney, Mary Sheepshanks, Jane Addams, Alice Hamilton, Grace Abbott, Emily Bach,de:Lida Gustava Heymann, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Emily Hobhouse, Chrystal Macmillan, Rosika Schwimmer. At the conference the women formed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WIL). Kathleen Courtney ultimately was elected as chairperson of the British section. In 1928, she was named a member of the Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union. In 1939 (the year WWII would begin) she was elected Vice-Chairman. From 1949 to 1951 she served as Chairman. Courtney continued to be involved in the campaign for women's suffrage. She helped establish the Adult Suffrage Society in 1916 and as joint-secretary she lobbied members of the House of Commons for extension of the franchise until the Qualification of Women Act was passed in 1918. The following year she became vice-president of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. As well as advocating the same voting rights as men, the organisation also campaigned for equal pay, fairer divorce laws and an end to the discrimination against women in the professions. Kathleen Courtney died at her home, unmarried with no children, at 3 Elm Tree Court on 7 December 1974 at age 96. A memorial service was held on 11 April 1975 at St Martin-in-the-Fields."
