  "text" : "Belukha Mountain (Russian: Белуха, lit \"whitey\"; Altai: Muztau or Üç Sümer), located in the Katun Mountains, is the highest peak of the Altai Mountains in Russia. It is part of the World Heritage Site entitled Golden Mountains of Altai. Belukha is a three-peaked mountain massif that rises along the border of Russia and Kazakhstan, just a few tens of miles north of the point where this border meets with the border of China. There are several small glaciers on the mountain, including Belukha Glacier. Of the two peaks, the eastern peak (4,506 m, 14,784 ft.) is higher than the western peak (4,440 m, 14,567 ft.). Belukha was first climbed in 1914 by the Tronov brothers. Most ascents of the eastern peak follow the same southern route as that taken in the first ascent. Though the Altai is lower in elevation than other Asian mountain groups, it is very remote, and much time and planning are required for its approach."

  "text" : "The Brocken, also sometimes referred to as the Blocksberg, is the highest peak of the Harz mountain range and also the highest peak of Northern Germany; it is located near Schierke in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt between the rivers Weser and Elbe. Although its elevation of 1,141 metres (3,743 ft) is below alpine dimensions, its microclimate resembles that of mountains of about 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The peak above the tree line tends to have a snow cover from September to May, and mists and fogs shroud it up to 300 days of the year. The mean annual temperature is only 2.9 °C (37.2 °F). It is the easternmost mountain in northern Germany; travelling east in a straight line, the next prominent elevation would be in the Ural Mountains in Russia. The Brocken has always played a role in legends and has been connected with witches and devils; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe took up the legends in his play Faust. The Brocken spectre is a common phenomenon on this misty mountain, where a climber's shadow cast upon fog creates eerie optical effects. Today the Brocken is part of the Harz National Park and hosts a historic botanical garden of about 1,600 alpine mountain plants. A narrow gauge steam railway, the Brocken Railway, takes visitors to the railway station at the top on 1,125 m (3,691 ft). FM-radio and television broadcasting make major use of the Brocken. The old television tower, the Sender Brocken, is now used as hotel and restaurant. It also has an observation deck, open to tourists."

  "text" : "Brasstown Bald is the highest point in the state of Georgia. Located in northeast Georgia, the mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah. The name in English is derived from a mistaken translation of the term for a former Cherokee village nearby, located along the upper Brasstown Creek (named in English from the same error) feeding the Hiawassee River. Across the North Carolina state line, immediately North of the mountain, are other places named in that error of English settlers: Brasstown, a community in the Brasstown township of Clay County, North Carolina. Brasstown Bald is partly in both Towns and Union counties, the peak being divided by the county line. The mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains (part of the Appalachian Mountains), and within the borders of the Blue Ridge Ranger District of the Chattahoochee National Forest. The mountain consists mostly of soapstone and dunite. On a clear day, it is possible to see the tall buildings of Atlanta, Georgia from the summit. The U.S. Forest Service has webcams atop the observation tower, and a RAWS weather station further down the mountain. The public can drive to the top via Georgia state route 180 Spur."

Though not particularly high, compared to other peaks within Scotland, the mountain is very prominent, owing to its isolation and the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain, and dominates the skyline from several viewpoints. The peak that stands out the most visually is Mither Tap (518 m, 1699 feet) and from its top there are good views of the county to the north and east. Most of the tops lie along an east / west ridge, with the exception of Millstone Hill (409 m) an outlier or spur which is separated from and to the south of the main ridge. Mither Tap has an Iron Age fort on its summit. Unlike with many other hilltop forts in the area, there are no signs of vitrification in the stone. Bennachie is visible from a number of distant points; to the north it is visible from Longman Hill, a point considerably to the north."

  "text" : "Ballard Down is an area of chalk downland on the Purbeck Hills in the English county of Dorset. The hills meet the English Channel here, and Ballard Down forms a headland, Ballard Point, between Studland Bay to the north and Swanage Bay to the south. The chalk here forms part of a system of chalk downlands in southern England, and once formed a continuous ridge between what is now west Dorset and the present day Isle of Wight. Old Harry Rocks, just offshore from the dip slope of the down, and The Needles on the westernmost tip of the Isle of Wight, are remnants of this ridge. The scarp slope of the down faces south, over Swanage, meeting the sea as Ballard Cliff. The down was an area of calcareous grassland for up to 1000 years until World War II, when there was a sudden rise in the need for arable agricultural land. The down is now owned by the National Trust, and has largely been returned to grassland. The National Trust allows grazing on the down to prevent it becoming a natural beech woodland climax community. The obelisk at Ballard Down commemorates the provision of a new supply of drinking water for Swanage in 1883. It was taken down in 1941 as it was a landmark that might have aided enemy aircraft during World War II, but was re-erected in 1952. Ballard Down forms the easternmost part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, which stretches for 155 kilometres (96 mi), from Orcombe Point near Exmouth, in the west, to Old Harry Rocks. The coastal exposures along the coastline comprise a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning about 185 million years. The Jurassic Coast includes a large range of important fossil zones."

  "text" : "Belknap Crater is a shield volcano in the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon. Belknap volcano is a Holocene example of the process which built the High Cascade Platform during the Pleistocene. It is a small shield volcano with a capping cinder cone. A number of other eruptions also occurred in the general area during roughly the same time period. About 1,300 years ago (1,330 14C years B.P.) a series of small spatter cones formed between Belknap and Blue Lake. North of these, a phreatic explosion blasted out the crater which is today occupied by Blue Lake. To the south are several cinder cones and associated lava flows, including Collier, Four-in-One, and Yapoah cones. Four-in-One Cone has been dated at about 1,900 years old (1,980 14C years B.P.) while Collier is dated at about 1,500 years old (1,600 14C years B.P.)"

  "text" : "Box Hill is a summit of the North Downs in Surrey, approximately 30 km (19 mi) south-west of London. The hill takes its name from the ancient box woodland found on the steepest west-facing chalk slopes overlooking the River Mole. The western part of the hill is owned and managed by the National Trust, whilst the village of Box Hill lies on higher ground to the east. The highest point is Betchworth Clumps at 224 m (735 ft) above OD, although the Salomons Memorial (at 172 metres) overlooking the town of Dorking is the most popular viewpoint. Box Hill lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and forms part of the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest. The north- and south-facing slopes support an area of chalk downland, noted for its orchids and other rare plant species. The hill provides a habitat for 40 species of butterfly, and has given its name to a species of squash bug, now found throughout south-east England. An estimated 850,000 people visit Box Hill each year. The National Trust visitors' centre provides both a cafeteria and gift shop, and the panoramic views of the western Weald may be enjoyed from the North Downs Way, a long-distance footpath that runs along the southern escarpment. Box Hill featured prominently on the route of the 2012 Summer Olympics cycling road race events (the men doing nine circuits and the women doing two circuits)."

The mountain was nameless until it was discovered to be higher than Hyndman Peak, previously regarded as the state's highest point. In February 1934, the U.S. Geological Survey named it for William Borah, the prominent senior U.S. Senator from Idaho, who had served for nearly 27 years at the time and was dean of the Senate. An outspoken isolationist, the \"Lion of Idaho\" ran for president two years later in 1936, but did not win the Republican nomination, and died in office in 1940."

  "text" : "Ben Lomond (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laomainn, 'Beacon Mountain'), 974 metres (3,196 ft), is a distinctive mountain in the Scottish Highlands. Situated on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, it is the most southerly of the Munros. Ben Lomond lies within the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, property of the National Trust for Scotland. Its accessibility from Glasgow and elsewhere in central Scotland, together with the relative ease of ascent from Rowardennan, makes it one of the most popular of all the Munros. On a clear day, it is visible from the higher grounds of Glasgow and across Strathclyde; this may have led to it being named 'Beacon Mountain', as with the equally far-seen Lomond Hills in Fife. Ben Lomond summit can also be seen from Ben Nevis, the highest peak in Britain, over 40 miles (64 km) away. The West Highland Way runs along the western base of the mountain, by the loch. Ben Lomond's popularity in Scotland has resulted in several namesakes in the former British colonies of Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Trinidad and the United States – see this list. The mountain is mentioned directly in the popular folk song The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond."

  "text" : "Barbeau Peak is a mountain in Qikiqtaaluk, Nunavut, Canada. Located on Ellesmere Island within Quttinirpaaq National Park, it is the highest mountain in Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic. The mountain was named in 1969 for Dr. Marius Barbeau (1883-1969), a Canadian anthropologist whose research into First Nations and Inuit cultures gained him international acclaim. Barbeau Peak is characterized by deep and long crevasses, razor thin ridges and highly variable and volatile weather. Barbeau Peak is the highest mountain within the British Empire Range as well as the Arctic Cordillera, as well as in all of eastern North America. Barbeau Peak was first climbed on 7 June 1967 by British geologist/glaciologist Geoffrey Hattersley-Smith as part of a joint Defence Research Board/Royal Air Force field party. The party both named the peak and determined its height. The second ascent was by an eight-man American team in June 1982 (Errington,Trafton AAC 1983) via the north ridge. Subsequent ascents have been made in 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2002, though as of 2006 only seven successful summits have been attained."

  "text" : "The Breithorn (German for \"broad horn\"; 4,164 m) is a mountain range of the Pennine Alps with its highest peak of the same name (but also called Breithorn (Western Summit)), located on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It lies on the main chain of the Alps, approximately halfway between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and east of the Theodul Pass. Most of the massif is glaciated and includes several subsidiary peaks, all located east of the main summit: the Central Breithorn, the western Breithorn Twin (or Eastern Breithorn), the Gendarm (or eastern Breithorn Twin) and the Roccia Nera. The main summit is sometimes distinguished by the name Western Breithorn (German: Breithorn (Westgipfel), Italian: Breithorn Occidentale). The nearest settlements are Zermatt (Valais) and St-Jacques (Aosta Valley). The Breithorn is considered the most easily climbed 4,000 m Alpine peak. This is due to the Klein Matterhorn cable car which takes climbers to over 3,820 m (12,700 ft) from Zermatt for a starting point. The standard route (SSW flank) is from the Italian side of the mountain (the south side) and continues over a glacial plateau before climbing to the summit on a 35 degree snow slope. However, inexperienced mountaineers may run into severe difficulty if caution is not taken near cornices or in bad weather. For experienced climbers wanting more of a challenge, the half traverse of the Breithorn crest is another option. The Breithorn was first climbed in 1813 by Henry Maynard (climber), Joseph-Marie Couttet, Jean Gras, Jean-Baptiste Erin and Jean-Jacques Erin."

  "text" : "Bear Mountain, is a prominent peak of the southern Taconic Mountains. It lies within the town of Salisbury, Connecticut, in the United States, and is the highest mountain summit in the state of Connecticut. The highest point in the state, however, is located on the south slope of Mount Frissell 1.3 miles (2.1 km) to the west at 2,379 feet (725 m). Much of the mountain is protected as part of the viewshed and corridor of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, which crosses the summit grounds. From the summit the view includes Twin Lakes and cultivated fields to the east, the Catskills and nearby Taconic peaks to the west, and Massachusetts' Mount Everett and Mount Race to the north. Though the mountain's elevation is commonly reported at 2316', the elevation near its stone monument tower, the proper summit lies approximately 125 feet northwest of the tower, accessible by a herd path following the mountain's abandoned Bee Line Trail to the Northwest Camp owned by the Connecticut Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club. The mountain is noted for its old growth scrub forest of pitch pines, birch, oak and other short-statured trees, much like its neighbors, Mounts Everett and Race, for its numerous wild blueberry bushes which produce in late July and early August, and for its rattlesnakes, which in summer are sometimes seen sunning themselves on the mountain's numerous open rocks of mica, schist and gneiss."

Baula is characterized by its almost perfect cone and by its little sister nearby, the Litla-Baula, where rare columnar strands of rhyolite are found. Together, Baula and Litla-Baula have often been described as Iceland's most beautiful pair of mountains. Some other good examples of similar \"intrusions\" in Iceland include the mountains Mælifell in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Hlíðarfjall, near lake Mývatn in the north of the country."

  "text" : "Beinn Eighe is a complex mountain massif in the Torridon area of the Highlands of Scotland. It forms a long ridge with many spurs and summits, two of which are classified as Munros. The name Beinn Eighe comes from the Scottish Gaelic meaning File Mountain. Unlike the neighbouring hill Slioch it has a cap of Cambrian basal quartzite which gives the peaks of Beinn Eighe a distinctive light colour. Its complex topography has made it popular with both hillwalkers and climbers and the National Nature Reserve on its northern side makes it an accessible mountain for all visitors."

Its highest elevation is 5,705 feet (1,739 m) in Colorado. The highest point of Black Mesa within New Mexico is 5,239 feet (1,597 m). In northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma, Black Mesa reaches 4,973 feet (1,516 m), the highest point in the state of Oklahoma. The plateau that formed at the top of the mesa has been known as a \"geological wonder\" of North America. There is abundant wildlife in this arid prairie environment, including mountain lions, butterflies, and the Texas horned lizard."

  "text" : "Beinn Dearg is the 4th highest of the Torridon mountains in the highlands of Scotland. Beinn Dearg offers all the typical features of a Torridon hill, with steeply terraced rocky sides dissected by near vertical gullies. The summit ridge is an airy crest that offers some easy scrambling; alternatively this can be avoided by following a path that traverses the terraces on the southern side. Unlike its higher neighbours, the hill just misses out on the magic height of 3,000 ft, and therefore lacks any peaks of Munro status. For this reason, if no other, it is climbed far less than the three major mountains surrounding it. In 2007, the Munro Society commissioned CMCR Ltd to survey Beinn Dearg in order to ascertain the precise height of the summit, and determine whether it might in fact be correctly categorised as a Munro. The summit was found to be 2.42 ft short ."

  "text" : "Black Mountain is the highest mountain peak in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, USA, with a summit elevation of 4,145 feet (1,263 m)  above mean sea level and a top to bottom height of over 2,500 feet (760 m). The summit is located at approximately 36°54′51″N 82°53′38″W﻿ / ﻿36.91417°N 82.89389°W in Harlan County, Kentucky near the Virginia border, just above the towns of Lynch, Kentucky and Appalachia, Virginia. It is about 500 feet (150 m) taller than any other mountain in Kentucky. Route 160 east of Lynch, Kentucky and west of Appalachia, Virginia crosses the mountain. The summit is reached by a narrow road that turns off to the right (coming from Lynch, KY or to the left, if coming from Appalachia, VA) at the Kentucky-Virginia line (the gap that is the highest part of Route 160) and leads past an FAA radar dome. There is a one lane dirt road to the left not far past the radar dome that leads to the summit. The summit is marked with an abandoned metal fire lookout tower (the cab and wooden steps are missing from the tower). There are also multiple radio towers along with transmitter buildings around the summit and a National Geodetic Survey benchmark is located on a large rock over the hill to the left of the fire tower. This benchmark is 6 feet below the highest point;  a second is directly under the old lookout tower, marking the latest survey of the highest natural point. The FAA Radar dome is nearby, but below the summit. Trees on both sides of the radar dome have been cleared, so views of other mountains are visible. On a clear day the Great Smoky Mountains on the Tennessee and North Carolina border are clearly visible. Black Mountain's history is intimately tied to the coal mining of the surrounding region. Lynch, Kentucky, was once one of the largest coal mining towns in the nation. In 1998, Jericol Mining, Inc., petitioned to use mountaintop removal methods in the area of Black Mountain. Though the summit itself was not directly threatened, many people protested this action due to the peak's status as the state's highest point. In 1999, Kentucky purchased mineral and timber rights to the summit and prevented future large scale mining. Coal companies have alleged that mined coal veins converge beneath the summit of Black Mountain and that the summit is prone to collapse. A coal company named Penn Virginia Resources of Radnor, Pennsylvania owns the summit, but allows public access with the completion of a waiver."

The mountain was first climbed May 30, 1954 via the south ridge by Colin Todd and Geoff Harrow of a New Zealand expedition led by Sir Edmund Hillary. Accessing the mountain is usually gained from the South, where climbers can ascend Mera Peak to acclimatise before moving up the valley to Baruntse base camp. It is recorded that 19-time M. Everest summiter Chhewang Nima died in 2010 on an expedition to Baruntse. He was hit by an avalanche at an altitude of about 7 km (23,114 feet) above sea level."

  "text" : "Ben Macdui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mac Duibh) is the second highest mountain in the United Kingdom after Ben Nevis, and the highest in the Cairngorms. After the defeat of Domnall mac Uilliam in 1187, Donnchad II, Earl of Fife, acquired Strathavon, territory stretching from Ballindalloch to Ben Macdui; because the mountain marked the western boundary of Donnchad's territory, historian and place-name scholar Professor G.W.S. Barrow suggested that the mountain took its name from Donnchad's family, the Mac Duibh. Ben Macdui lies on the southern edge of the Cairn Gorm plateau, on the boundary between Aberdeenshire and Moray. Probably the easiest route of ascent is from the Coire Cas car park at the foot of Cairngorm Ski Centre by way of a path that leads up over slowly rising moorland. This route is about 7 km (4 mi) long; a somewhat longer route allows one to also climb Cairn Gorm. One possible alternative route follows the path coming up from Loch Etchachan. This loch may be reached from Loch Avon to the north or by coming up from Glen Derry to the South. Other routes include coming over Derry Cairngorm, or via the Lairig Ghru pass, which lies to the west of Ben Macdui. Nearly all these routes are long days by Scottish standards. When coming from the south it is common to use a bicycle to cover the 4 km (2½ mi) separating the road end at Linn of Dee from Derry Lodge at the southern end of the massif. Before the production of accurate maps of Scotland in the nineteenth century it was not known for certain that Ben Nevis was the highest point in Britain, and it was often thought that Ben Macdui might be the higher. After Ben Nevis was confirmed as the higher some locals planned to build a cairn on the top of Ben Macdui to make its height greater than the Lochaber peak, but these plans did not come to fruition. The summit of the mountain has a direction indicator erected in 1925 by the Cairngorm Club of Aberdeen in memory of a past president, Mr. Alexander Copland. The indicator shows the direction of the most important hills that can be seen from the summit in clear weather. Snow-patches have been known to persist at various locations on Ben Macdui, most notably Garbh Uisge Beag."

  "text" : "Beacon Hill, near Loughborough, in Leicestershire, England, is a popular country park. It is one of several beacon hills in the United Kingdom. The park consists of over 135 hectares (330 acres) of grassland and woodland and offers recreational walking, and some short climbs. With a maximum height of 248 metres (814 ft), it is the second highest point in Leicestershire after Bardon Hill. An extinct volcano, in Whitwick, 4 miles (6 km) to the west, was responsible for the fine-grained igneous rocks that the hill consists of. Beacon Hill was the site of a Bronze Age hill fort. Today a toposcope indicates landmarks which can be seen from the summit. These include Lincoln Cathedral and the hills of the Peak District. Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station is aligned so that, seen from the summit, only two of its eight cooling towers are visible. On a clear day Belvoir Castle can be seen as well as the hills in the Peak District. Derby, Nottingham, and the tower of Lincoln Cathedral can be seen with a pair of binoculars. Loughborough is seen below the hill as is Beaumanor Hall. You can also hear and see steam trains on the Great Central Railway which has stations at Loughborough, Quorn and Woodhouse. It was featured on the 2005 TV programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the Midlands. There are some very interesting rocks on the summit. Nearby are two small woods both accessible to the public. Jubilee Wood is 2 miles (3 km) north-west of the lower Beacon hill car park on the Woodhouse Eaves to Nanpantan road and the Outwoods which is adjacent to Jubilee Wood. The park has been awarded the Green Flag Award."

  "text" : "Brading Down is a chalk down southwest of Brading, Isle of Wight. It is a prominent hill which overlooks Sandown Bay, with spectacular views across the bay towards Shanklin, and Culver Down. It is a Local Nature Reserve. Parts of the down are private, including an area used as a covered reservoir, and some for agriculture. But much of the down, some 35 hectares (86 acres), is open to the public and is owned by the Isle of Wight Council. The main area of Brading Down is fenced and grazed but access on foot and for horse riders is available from the many pathways entering the area, and the car parks bordering the main Newport to Brading Road. The thin chalk soils to the east of the site support a typical downland plant community with pyramidal orchids being a particular feature in the summer. In recent years a programme of scrub clearance has been undertaken. The area is good for butterflies including common blue, chalkhill blue, small, large and dingy skippers, marbled white, gatekeeper, and meadow brown. In addition to the wildlife interest of chalk downland, the ancient field system on Brading Down is a Scheduled Monument. The finest surviving ancient field system on the Island is to be found on the down. This is likely to be of late Iron Age or Roman date and highlights the last time the fields were ploughed. The views over Brading Roman Villa and Sandown Levels reinforce the historical significance of the area. Further down the slopes, first world war practice trenches and former chalk pits show evidence of more recent archaeological interest."

  "text" : "Braeriach (Scottish Gaelic: Bràigh Riabhach/Am Bràigh Riabhach) is the third-highest mountain in the British Isles, surpassed only by Ben Nevis and Ben Macdui. It is the highest point in the western massif of the Cairngorms, separated from the central section (containing Ben Macdui and Cairn Gorm) by the pass of the Lairig Ghru. The summit has a crescent shape, with several corries. In the north-facing corrie of Garbh Coire Mor the snow has completely melted just 5 times in the last century: 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003 & 2006  and the patches that linger there are the longest-lying snow patches in Scotland. Probably the most commonly used route up Braeriach starts from Sugar Bowl car park, on the road leading the Cairn Gorm ski area. From here a path leads over the hillside to a steep-sided rocky ravine known as the Chalamain Gap, before descending around 100 metres to the Lairig Ghru. After crossing this pass the route heads for the summit via Braeriach's north ridge, crossing a subsidiary peak, Sròn na Lairige. The summit is about 9 km from the car park by this route."

The pass is noted as the site of the first official mountain climb in the Tour de France on 11 July 1905, the first rider to the top of the climb being René Pottier and the stage being won by Hippolyte Aucouturier. Stage 9 of the 2005 Tour crossed this pass on the centenary of the original climb. Ballon d'Alsace features Alpine and Cross Country skiing tracks. The mountain is part of the so-called Belchen System, a group of mountains with the name \"Belchen\" (in German) that may have been part of a Celtic sun calendar."

  "text" : "Ben Lomond, just north of Ogden, Utah, is a peak in the northern portion of the Wasatch Mountains. A popular trail passes over its summit (elevation 9,716 feet (2,961 m)), accessible from four different trailheads to the north, south, and east. It is often referred to by locals as Ben Lomond Peak, Mt. Ben Lomond, and Ben Lomond Mountain. The USGS has it labeled as Ben Lomond on maps. Ben Lomond stands out along the Wasatch Front because the mountain range appears to run east and west along the Wasatch Range, while most mountains appear to run south and north. Two miles northwest of Ben Lomond is Willard Peak, with an elevation of 9,764 feet (2,976 m). Northwest of Willard Peak is Inspiration Point. A dirt road travels 14 miles (23 km) from Mantua, Utah to Inspiration Point. The road is usually not passable until July due to deep snow that resists melting due to the area's northern exposure. Atop Inspiration Point on a clear day, one can see Salt Lake City to the south, Willard Bay and the Great Salt Lake to the west, and the city of Logan, Utah to the northeast. From Inspiration Peak one can hike or bike to the summit of Ben Lomond, and then continue east to a trailhead on North Ogden Pass. The trail is listed as one of the top mountain bike rides in Utah. The distance from the North Ogden trailhead to the summit of Ben Lomond is approximately 9 miles (14 km). Ben Lomond was named after the mountain Ben Lomond in the Scottish Highlands. Mary Wilson Montgomery an early settler thought the mountain range resembled the Munro. According to some sources, the Paramount Pictures logo, known as Majestic Mountain, was modeled after Ben Lomond. It is said that William W. Hodkinson, the founder of Paramount and a native of the Ogden area, initially drew the image on a napkin during a meeting in 1914."

Made of Carboniferous Limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills. Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320–350 million years ago. The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple. At the seaward end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. Brean Down is now owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to both the geology and presence of nationally rare plants including the white rock-rose. It has also been scheduled as an ancient monument."

  "text" : "Bogoslof Island or Agasagook Island (Aleut: Aĝasaaĝux̂) is the summit of a largely submarine stratovolcano located in the Bering Sea in the U.S. state of Alaska, 31 miles (50 km) behind the main Aleutian volcanic arc. It has a land area of 173 acres (0.70 km2) and is unpopulated. The peak elevation of the island is 490 feet (150 m). It last erupted in 1992. It is 1.76 kilometres (1.09 mi) long and 540 metres (0.34 mi) wide. The stratovolcano rises about 6,000 feet (1,800 m) from the seabed but the summit is the only part that projects above sea level. The first known emergence of the island above sea level was recorded during an underwater eruption in 1796. Since then, parts of the island have been successively added and eroded. About 2,000 feet (610 m) north west of Bogoslof a small volcanic dome extruded in 1883 from the same stratovolcano emerges from the water as a stack rock known as Fire Island. At the southwest side of Bogoslof another dome erupted in 1796 and is now called Castle Rock. Other eruptions have occurred in 1796-1804, 1806-1823, 1883-1895, 1906, 1907, 1909-1910, 1926-1928 and 1992. The island is uninhabited by humans but is a breeding site for seabirds, seals and sea lions. About 90,000 tufted puffins, guillemots, red-legged kittiwakes and gulls nest here, and there is an expanding rookery for fur seals while a sea lion rookery which once housed 5,000 individuals has reduced in size. In 1909 President Theodore Roosevelt designated Bogoslof and neighboring Fire Island a sanctuary for sea lions and nesting marine birds. Together, as the Bogoslof Wilderness, they are now part of the Aleutian Islands unit of Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. In November 1967, the island was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. The islands were added to the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1970."

  "text" : "Ben More (Scottish Gaelic: A' Bheinn Mhòr, meaning \"the great mountain\") is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, near Crianlarich. It is the highest of the so-called Crianlarich Hills to the south-east of the village, and there is no higher land in the British Isles south of Ben More. It is separated from Stob Binnein by the Bealach-eadar-dha Beinn, meaning \"col between two hills\". The simplest ascent starts from Benmore Farm on the A85. Initially one should follow the path leading up Benmore Burn, before leaving this path and heading up the northwest ridge of Ben More. The ridge is unrelentingly steep, rising 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) in about 2.5 miles (4.0 km). The north-east ridge may prove a preferable alternative, being craggier and less steep. To reach this the walker should follow the burn of Allt Coire Chaorach, before striking for the ridge of Sròn nam Fòirsairean once clear of the forestry that cloaks the lower slopes of this side of Ben More. This route is around 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) long. Ben More is often climbed in conjunction with Stob Binnein by descending to the Bealach-eadar-dha Beinn and then on to the second peak. Descent may be made from the col direct to Benmore Burn. Ben More's north side contains a long-lasting snow patch, which – uniquely in the Southern Highlands – is named on a 1:25000 Ordnance Survey map, and is called the Cuidhe Chrom (crooked wreath), on account of the shape it forms in late spring/early summer. This patch frequently lasts until well into June and sometimes July. The similar name Cuidhe Cròm appears as a summit near Lochnagar. In the event of an incident, Killin Mountain Rescue Team are on duty. A webcam located at the eastern edge of Crianlarich captures Ben More. It provides updates every 10 minutes. See"

  "text" : "Black Hill is a hill in the Peak District, England. It is the highest point in the historic county of Cheshire, but now lies on the border between the boroughs of Kirklees in West Yorkshire and High Peak in Derbyshire, reaching 582 metres (1,909 ft) above sea level. The top is peaty and thus very boggy after rain. The area surrounding the summit itself had virtually no vegetation and was very dark, giving the hill an appropriate name. However, recent restoration work has eliminated much of the exposed peat. Black Hill is crossed by the Pennine Way whose now-paved surface allows walkers to reach the top dry-shod even in the wettest of weather. The hill can be visited by a number of routes, including along the Pennine Way from Crowden via the Laddow Rocks cliffs; bogs permitting, a return can be made over Westend Moss (the pre-1966 route of the Pennine Way) to create a pleasant circular walk. Another popular approach is from the junction of the A635 and the Wessenden Head Road (to Meltham), known locally as the 'Isle of Skye' (after a former hotel). This provides access to a paved section of the Pennine Way southwards to Black Hill. Black Hill can also be reached easily from Holme Moss via access land, but this route requires the use of map reading and possible a compass as although the ground is level it becomes trackless and confusing in places. South of Crowden, the Pennine Way next visits Bleaklow and Kinder Scout (both of which are slightly higher, just over 2,000 feet (610 m), and so are Hewitts). The triangulation column (\"trig point\") and highest point on Black Hill (and the highest point in West Yorkshire) is on a small elevated mound, called Soldiers' Lump. According to Wainwright the support timbers for the Ramsden theodolite, used by the Royal Engineers in the original Ordnance Survey which began in 1784, were still to be found here many years later."

  "text" : "Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne. It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain. Ben Lui is the highest and most famous of a group of four Munros that lie south of Glen Lochy, and about 10 km north of the top end of Loch Lomond. The other three peaks in the group are Beinn a' Chleibh, Ben Oss and Beinn Dubhchraig. The Ben Lui range of peaks is designated as a National Nature Reserve. The cliffs and rocky outcrops are particularly moist, with lower than normal levels of acidity in the soil. This leads to an unusually lush growth of mountain plants, with saxifrages, mosses and lichens being especially evident. The simplest and shortest ascent of Ben Lui may be made from Glen Lochy, near the point where the burn of Eas Daimh flows into the Lochy. A path leads up through an area of forestry and then onto the northwest ridge, reaching the summit in just over 3 km. Descent may be varied by visiting Beinn a’ Chleibh, which lies 2 km to the south west. An approach from the east allows for appreciation of the mountain's most celebrated feature, the rocky circular bowl of Coire Gaothaich. One may either start from Tyndrum Lower station or Dalrigh in Strath Fillan; tracks from both starting points merge, and follow Glen Cononish to the foot of Ben Lui. From here the route follows the northern ridge of the mountain, Stob Garbh, to the summit, the distance being about 9 km. This route is particularly treacherous in winter, even as late as April, when the final third of the ascent is often extremely icy. Furthermore, it can be extremely difficult to navigate through the crags around the upper rim of the Coire Gaothaich in poor visibility. By descending via the south east ridge the walker may elect to include Ben Oss (and possibly Beinn Dubhcraig) in the route before returning to the start. If transport can be arranged a reasonably fit hillwalker can traverse all four Munros of the Ben Lui group in a day. Ben Lui stands at the Head of Glen Fyne. A lochan on the slopes of Ben Lui has been identified as the source of Scotland's longest river, the Tay."

  "text" : "The Brendon Hills are a range of hills in west Somerset, England. The hills merge level into the eastern side of Exmoor and are included within the Exmoor National Park. The highest point of the range is Lype Hill at 1,388 feet (423 m) above sea level with a secondary summit several kilometres to the southeast at 1,350 feet (411 m). Both points are marked by Ordnance Survey trig points and are located within enclosed farmland. Early versions of the name include Brunedun and Brundon reflecting an original name of Bruna or Brune, meaning 'brown one'. Dun is a common Old English word for a fairly flat and extensive hill. This name is not connected with the village of Brendon in Devon, the name of which has a different origin. The terrain is broken by a series of deeply incised streams and rivers running roughly southwards to meet the River Haddeo, a tributary of the River Exe. The hills are quite heavily cultivated unlike their neighbouring upland areas of Exmoor and the Quantock Hills. The Brendon Hills are largely formed from the Morte Slates, a thick faulted and folded sequence of Devonian age sedimentary rocks. An east-west aligned anticline/syncline pair known as the Brendon Anticline and Brendon Syncline folds these rocks. The fold couplet is itself offset by displacement of the rocks on the NNW-SSE aligned Timberscombe Fault System. Over the centuries they have been mined for minerals, notably ironstone from which iron is extracted for making steel. During the 19th century this activity reached a peak with the West Somerset Mineral Railway, including an 800 feet (244 m) incline, being built to take the ore to Watchet from where it was sent to Ebbw Vale for smelting. The main mining operations ended when the mines were worked out towards the end of the 19th century. The hills are on the route of the Coleridge Way and are also crossed by the Samaritans Way."

The hill is geologically part of the Cotswolds and lies within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, although as the result of erosion over millions of years it now stands isolated in the Vale of Evesham At the summit, adjacent to Kemerton Camp, is a small stone tower called Parsons Folly (or the Banbury Stone Tower) which stands at GPS coordinates (52.059963, -2.064606). The tower was built in the mid-18th century for John Parsons, MP (1732–1805), squire of Kemerton Court and intended as a summer house, from which a more extensive view of the surrounding countryside could be seen. The 981 feet natural height of the hill contributes to the final height of the tower, whose top now reaches 1000 feet. A similar tower on Leith Hill increases the overall height from 965 feet to 1029 feet. The folly became a well-known county landmark, and was believed to have inspired the building of Broadway Tower. The current owners, Overbury Estate, lease out the tower as a mobile phone base station, and a number of large aerials have been fitted to its exterior."

It is a complex mountain, with many ridges and subsidiary peaks, one of which, Stob Coire Sgreamhach, is classified as a separate Munro. The most noticeable features of Bidean nam Bian are the famous Three Sisters of Glen Coe, three steeply-sided ridges that extend north into the Glen. Two of the sisters, Gearr Aonach (Short Ridge) and Aonach Dubh (Black Ridge) converge at Stob Coire nan Lochan, a 1,115 m (3,658 feet) subsidiary peak of Bidean nam Bian that lies about 1 km to the northeast of the actual summit. The final, most easterly sister, Beinn Fhada (Long Hill), joins the Bidean nam Bian massif at the summit of Stob Coire Sgreamhach. Beinn Fhada is separated from Gearr Aonach by a glen known as Coire Gabhail. This can translate to Glen of Capture, however the glen is more normally known as the Hidden or Lost Valley, as it has a wide flat area concealed from Glen Coe by the landslip which blocked the entrance and allowed a loch to form. The valley was used by Clan Macdonald to hide their livestock from raiders, or hide cattle they themselves had stolen. The steep rough path up from Glen Coe skirts a wooded ravine, and is a popular short walk (around 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) in total), though it involves a river crossing and some rocky sections."

  "text" : "Buachaille Etive Beag (Scottish Gaelic: Buachaille Eite Beag), is a mountain located between Glen Coe and Glen Etive, on the edge of Rannoch Moor in the Scottish Highlands. Viewed from the south in Glen Etive it forms a twin with Buachaille Etive Mòr (the 'Great Herdsman of Etive'), from which it is separated by a bealach at a height of about 480 metres. The mountain is often known affectionately as the \"wee Buachaille\", which is a literal translation of its Gaelic name. Buachaille Etive Beag forms a ridge about 3 km in length that runs in a southwest–northeast direction. It has two peaks of Munro status: Stob Dubh and Stob Coire Raineach. The latter became a Munro in the 1997 revision of Munro's Tables, in which all tops with a topographic prominence of more than 500 feet (152.4 m) were promoted to full Munro status. The most common route on the mountain starts from the A82 at the head of Glen Coe. A cairn and a sign mark the existence of a right-of-way to Glen Etive, following the through the Lairig Eilde that separates Buachaille Etive Beag from Bidean nam Bian. This route is followed for around 1.5 km, at which point most hillwalkers simply head up the hillside to reach the bealach between the two summits, which is at a height of around 750 m. From here Stob Coire Raineach lies about 0.5 km to the northeast, whilst Stob Dubh is about 2 km to the southwest. After bagging both tops, most walkers simply descend by their route of ascent. One may also reach (and descend from) the bealach by means of the Lairig Gartain, which separates Buachaille Etive Beag, from its larger sibling, Buachaille Etive Mor. An alternative route would be to start from Glen Etive, thus allowing for a traverse of the ridge. The southwest ridge is unrelentingly steep, and one would be obliged to arrange transport back to Glen Etive or walk an additional 4 km to return via the Lairig Eilde or Lairig Gartain."

Bangor Mountain is much less precipitous on its southern side. Along a substantial part of the crest of the mountain is Bangor Golf Club—more properly St Deiniol's Golf Club. Because of the shape of the mountain, the golf course is linear and crosses some lanes and minor roads. There are several rocky outcrops at high points on the mountain providing panoramic views of the city centre, the Menai Strait and over to the east of Anglesey, including the town of Beaumaris. This is probably the best location from which to see the buildings of the Bangor University and the cathedral—as shown in the image below. Along the side of the high street, the scarp slope is nearly vertical and clothed with trees. The slope is so severe and the mountain so close, that much of the High Street does not receive direct sunlight between November and March. Bangor Mountain has a diverse ecology with a variety of mixed woods, open grassland and extensive areas of gorse although biodiversity appears to be significantly reduced within the confines of the golf course. Around the rocky outcrops and alongside some of the many paths that weave their way around the mountain are large deposits of litter (paper, cans and plastic bags). The extensive groves of gorse are often set alight by arsonists in dry summers producing a blaze that can be seen for many miles around. Whilst this may benefit the gorse and the ecosystem based around gorse, the fires often spread into other areas of established woods where considerable damage is caused. These fires can also threaten gardens and outbuildings lining the base of the hill. Bangor Mountain provides the main southern watershed for the River Adda, the principal river flowing through Bangor. However, as the river has now been culverted throughout its whole length in the built up area of the city, it is little known to the city's population. Part of Bangor Mountain was removed to provide car parking for a new discount supermarket. As a result the footpath in this area now approaches very close to a precipitous edge protected by two-metre high railings topped with saw tooth edging. The placement of the carpark has occasionally led to vandals damaging parked cars by means of throwing rubble down from the footpath."

  "text" : "Brahmagiri, is a mountain range in the Western Ghats of south India. It is situated on the border between Kodagu district in Karnataka state in the north and Wayanad district of Kerala state on the south . Brahmagiri Hill, at 1608 m height, is a scenic tourist attraction. The top of Brahmagiri Hill is well forested and has a lot of wildlife. Thirunelli Temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, lies on the Kerala side of Brahmagiri. This temple is known as Dakshina Kasi or the Kasi of the South. The temple was constructed in an ancient style and includes 30 granite pillars. According to legend, the temple was constructed by Lord Brahma himself. Pakshipathalam at an altitude of 1740 m is another attraction on the Kerala side. Pakshipathalam has a cave that is said to have been used by rishis in ancient times. On the Karnataka side it is also known by the name of Munikal cave. Iruppu (or Irpu or Lakshmana Tirtha) Falls of the Lakshmana Tirtha River lies on the Karnataka side of Brahmagiri. According to legend, when Rama and Lakshmana were searching for Sita, they became thirsty. Lakshmana shot an arrow into the Brahmagiri from which the river sprang. Rama is said to have dedicated a Shiva Kshethra known as Rajeshwara Temple on the banks of river Lakshmana Tirtha. The Lakshmana Tirtha river eventually flows into the Kaveri River."

  "text" : "Butser Hill is a chalk hill and one of the highest points in Hampshire. It is also the highest point on the chalk ridge of the South Downs and the second highest point in the South Downs National Park after Blackdown in the Western Weald. Although only 271 metres (889 ft) high, it qualifies as one of England's Marilyns. It is located within the borders of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, situated about three miles south of the historic market town of Petersfield, Hampshire. The name Butser comes from the Old English Bryttes Oran meaning Briht's slope. Oran or Ora is Old English for flat topped hill and/or steep slope. The flat summit is surrounded by a number of spurs. Iron Age ditches and banks divide the spurs from the summit although the purpose of these earthworks is unclear. There are aerial masts on the hill. The hill was purchased by Hampshire County Council in 1966. Prior to the purchase the summit was used for growing wheat but now the only farming activity is grazing. Most of the park, including Butser Hill, is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and since 1998 as a National Nature Reserve. At 2.312 square kilometres (0.893 sq mi) this is large when compared against other lowland terrestrial SSSIs and is the second largest area of calcareous grassland in Hampshire. Butser Hill SSSI has been proposed by the Government as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), recognising its importance from a European perspective. This is due to the rich variety of flora and fauna located upon the hill. Butser Hill is in the top twenty Hampshire chalk grassland sites for its rich vascular flora, and is the richest chalk grassland site in Hampshire in terms of its bryophyte (125 species) and lichen (82 species) flora. As well as this, over 30 species of butterfly have been recorded, including populations of Duke of Burgundy and the Silver-spotted Skipper, making the area an important conservation area for many butterfly species. Butser Hill has also hosted entertainment events. Since 2007 it has hosted butserfest and has hosted various country fairs in the past. There is an annual Fell Run called the Butser Hill Challenge that involves running up and down the hill three times."

  "text" : "Beinn a' Bheithir (Scottish Gaelic pronunciation: [peɲ ə ˈvehəɾʲ], 'Mountain of the Thunderbolt') is a mountain lying to the south of Ballachulish, on the south side of Loch Leven in the Scottish Highlands. It boasts two Munro summits: the higher peak Sgorr Dhearg (Scottish Gaelic pronunciation: [skuːrˠ ʝɛɾak]) lies about 2 km (1.2 mi) east of Sgorr Dhonuill (Sgurr Dhòmhnaill). The mountain forms a horseshoe shape, with ridges pointing north enclosing the corrie of Gleann a' Chaolais (Glenachulish). The lower slopes on this side are cloaked in conifer plantations. To the south the mountain forms a steep ridge forming the northern wall of Glen Duror, which is also forested. There are several routes up Beinn a' Bheithir. One of the simplest is to head through the forestry up Gleann a' Chaolais, reaching the 757 m (2,484 ft) high bealach between the two summits. Both summits can be bagged from here, and the walker may descend by the route of ascent. Other routes on include the north and northwest ridges of Sgorr Dhearg, or a steep ascent from Glen Duror."

It is 261 metres high and has one of England's most well known hill forts on its slopes, visible from the main A34 road which passes close by. From there, outstanding views of the surrounding area and much of Hampshire may be obtained. The site is open to the public and managed by Hampshire County Council.

It has several summits, the highest, some distance inland, reaching approximately 1,260 feet (384 m) above sea level. The southern face of the peak is remarkable for its striking cliffs, the result of quarrying in past years.Lying within Hudson Highlands State Park, it offers many stunning views of the river and region and is quite popular with hikers, to the point that a rail flag stop has been established on the Metro North line which runs right by the base of the ridge along NY 9D. Until the early 20th century, the mountain was also known as St. Anthony's Face or Turk's Face, after a facelike stone formation on the southern cliffs that was destroyed by quarrymen in 1901."

The plateau and steep cliffs extend for over 6 miles across the peninsula of Magilligan and dominate the skyline over the villages of Bellarena, Downhill, Castlerock and Benone beach. The area has been classified as both an Area of Special Scientific Interest and as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The total area of the AONB is 138 km². The Bishops Road, named after the Bishop of Derry, extends across the plateau. Notable features include the Mussenden Temple and a cliff top viewing area on the Bishops Road giving good views over Lough Foyle and County Donegal."

  "text" : "Ben Wyvis (from the Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Uais meaning \"Hill of Terror\") is a mountain located in Easter Ross, Ross and Cromarty, Highland, in northern Scotland, north-west of Dingwall. It forms an undulating ridge running roughly north-south for about 5 km, the highest summit of which is Glas Leathad Mòr. Geologically, the ridge is composed of Moine pelitic gneiss. The summit ridge is carpeted with the woolly hair moss Racomitrium lanuginosum, rather than the heather or grass found on most other Scottish mountains, whilst the lower slopes support dwarf shrub heath and boglands. The heath and bogland is home to a variety of plants, including dwarf birch, cloudberry, dwarf cornel and alpine bearberry. The site is an important breeding ground for the Eurasian dotterel, and represents at least 2.4% of the breeding population in Great Britain . The site is designated as both a National Nature Reserve and a Special Protection Area. It is usually climbed from the west, as that side is easy of access from the A835 road. The lower slopes are forested, and owned by the Forestry Commission. The summit ridge itself is a National Nature Reserve. Ben Wyvis stands on the northern edge of the Clan Munro country. By tradition, the Munros hold their land from the Crown. The King declared that they held their lands on condition of furnishing a snowball at midsummer if required. This condition they could easily fulfil, as snow was to be found in some of the mountain corries of their property all year round."

  "text" : "Bluff Knoll is a peak in the Stirling Range in the Great Southern region of Western Australia (WA). It is 1,099 metres (3,606 ft) above sea level, and is one of only a few places to experience regular snowfalls in Western Australia, with some snow reported in most years. The last heavy snowfall was on 6 October 1992 when 20 centimetres of snow was recorded and light snow was seen at the base, 450 metres (1,480 ft). Although Bluff Knoll is sometimes claimed to be the highest point in WA, the highest peak is actually Mount Meharry in Karijini National Park in the Hamersley Range, which is 1,249 metres (4,098 ft) above sea level. Local Aboriginal people, from the Qaaniyan and Koreng groups (or tribes), who wore kangaroo skin cloaks in cold weather, called the mountain Pualaar Miial, meaning \"great many-faced hill\". The mountain is often shrouded in a mist which curls around the peaks and floats into the gullies. Local people believed this to be a spirit named Noatch (literally meaning \"dead body\" or \"corpse\"). Climbing Bluff Knoll, a round trip of about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi), takes three to four hours, and can be achieved by anyone with a reasonable level of fitness. It is important to be well prepared for the trek, especially in the colder months as many people have been exposed to the cold weather during climbs. Water is essential during summer as dehydration is a common problem for hikers. Many rescues have been performed by local State Emergency Service (SES) units. Hikers who fall and injure themselves may be unable to return to the base unaided. They may also become fatigued or fall victim to the elements. It is possible to ascend the face of the bluff with rock climbing equipment, or abseil down it, though it is very dangerous and preparation is vital. The view from the summit encompasses the Stirling and Porongurup mountain ranges, as well as the coast near Albany."

  "text" : "Not to be confused with Billinge Hill, Blackburn. Billinge Hill, also known as Billinge Lump, is the highest point in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens in North West England. It is also the highest point of Merseyside. It lies in Billinge, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. It is one of the 176 hills graded as a Marilyn in England. A beacon tower is at the summit. Built as a summerhouse to Winstanley Hall in the 18th century, it was used for the Year 2000 celebrations. Most fireworks displays for miles around can be seen from the summit and people often gather there in small numbers to watch displays over the towns of Wigan and St Helens and the local village of Rainford. Over the years it has been covered in graffiti which was recently cleaned off and the metal panels restricting access to the inside of the beacon have been painted black. Nearby to the north-west are several large transmitter masts which take advantage of the height and relative isolation of the land. The views are fairly extensive, notably to the south-west where, when clear, the mountains of Snowdonia, in Wales, can be seen and to the north-east Winter Hill can be seen. Looking east one sees Manchester and the Derbyshire Peak District. On a clear day, it is possible to see Blackpool Tower over thirty miles away, the town of St. Helens and the Widnes - Runcorn bridge. Depending on the conditions and direction it is facing, the telescope at Jodrell Bank can be seen to the south-east too. Billinge Hill was also used by the Royal Observer Corps, and there was a bunker at the site, 60 yards (55 m) West of and below Beacon. The Beacon itself was used for aircraft observation during and after the war. The bunker would have been used to monitor the location of nuclear blasts and the resulting fallout over Lancashire in the event of nuclear war. The post opened in January 1960 and closed in October 1968."

  "text" : "Biokovo (pronounced [bîɔkɔʋɔ]) is the second-highest mountain range in Croatia, located along the Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic Sea, between the rivers of Cetina and Neretva. It is sometimes referred to as Bijakova, especially among inhabitants of the eastern side of the mountain. Its highest peak is Sveti Jure (Saint George), at 1762 m.a.s.l. It shows a typical karst landscape. Atop the peak there is a powerful FM and DVB-T transmitter. The 196 km2 of its area is protected as a nature park with over 1,500 plant and animal species, some of which are endemic. Biokovo is one in a line of Dinaric Alps stretching along the Dalmatian coast - northwest of it is Mosor and southeast of it are Sutvid and Rilić. In the east, the Šibenik runs in parallel. When the weather is very clear, from the top of Biokovo it is possible to see Monte Gargano in Italy, which is 252 km (157 mi) away. To aid the hikers, there is the Biokovo Nature Park Visitor Center in downtown Makarska. However, Biokovo can be perilous if hiking unprepared - tourists erroneously imagine peaks to be closer than they are and, oblivious to the danger, have been known to go hiking wearing flip-flops, without water, wearing shirts with military camouflage patterns making them harder to spot for search and rescue teams. From 1976 to 2007 24 hikers have died on Biokovo, while 37 had to be rescued."

  "text" : "Beinn Mheadhoin is a mountain in Scotland. By some counts it is the thirteenth-highest mountain of Great Britain. It lies in the very heart of the Cairngorm mountains, and is one of the most remote hills in the region. The summit is broad and flat. It is noted for its summit tors; large boulders left by retreating ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The highest point of the hill is, in fact, the top of one of the largest tors, and an easy scramble is required to reach it. The mountain is remote; the shortest route is to climb over the main Cairn Gorm plateau in order to ascend Beinn Mheadhoin. The shortest route of ascent is from the Coire Cas car park at the foot of the Cairn Gorm ski area, initially heading for the ridge of Fiacaill a' Choire Chais. From the head of the ridge the walker then descends to Loch Avon via Coire Raibert. The route then goes round the head of the loch, passing the famous Shelter Stone, before rising again to reach Loch Etchachan. From here the route heads northeast onto the summit ridge. This route is about 20 kilometres (12 mi) in length, with 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) of ascent required. Beinn Mheadhoin may also be climbed from the south, via Glen Derry. This route is much longer, though a bicycle can be used on the track to shorten the time taken. An ascent from this direction could conceivably be combined with an ascent of Derry Cairngorm."

It lies southeast of Laxford Bridge and northwest of Loch More along the A838 road, and just west of Loch Stack. It is regarded as a moderately easy walk for walkers and hikers due to its overall height and its accessibility from the A838 road. It is most commonly climbed from the southeast, following the long eastern ridge of Leathad na Stioma. A slightly steeper alternative comes from the northwestern side, starting from near Lochstack Lodge. These starting points are both located on the A838 road, thus a traverse is possible. On 6 August 2005 former U.K. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook died after collapsing with a heart attack whilst walking down from the summit."

The highest feature on the plateau is the unimposing summit of Legges Tor, at 1572 m, on the northern aspect of the plateau. The southern end of the plateau is dominated by Stacks Bluff, 1,527 metres (5,010 ft), which is an imposing feature that drops away to a cliffline 600 metres (2,000 ft) above the surrounding foothills. The prominent outlier peaks of Ragged Jack (1,369 metres (4,491 ft)), Mensa Moor (1,358 metres (4,455 ft)) and Tower Hill (1,122 metres (3,681 ft)) surround the plateau. Ben Lomond is east of Launceston in the Ben Lomond National Park. Tasmania's premier Alpine skiing operations are located at Ben Lomond with downhill skiing facilities in the State. Its accessibility from Launceston, together with the existence of a ski village on the plateau make Ben Lomond an all year round favourite for tourists and hikers. Access to the village and summit can be made via several walking tracks or via a zig-zag road known as \"Jacobs Ladder\"."

The south west side of Blue Bell Hill is a Site of Special Scientific Interest as it harbours several rare plant species. A picnic area serves as a rest point for walkers on the North Downs Way which runs along the top of the hill whilst the prehistoric trackway of the Pilgrims' Way skirts its foot. A modern crematorium also surmounts the hill. The A229 dual carriageway follows the route of a former Roman road and climbs the hill, today linking the M2 and M20 motorways. High Speed 1 also runs beneath the hill, via the North Downs Tunnel, and archaeological work in advance of it uncovered a Neolithic long house on its slopes. The Bluebell Hill transmitting station is located on the hill."

  "text" : "Bazman (Persian: بزمان‎‎, also known as Kuh-e Bazman) is a stratovolcano in a remote desert region of Sistan and Baluchestan Province in south-eastern Iran. A 500-m-wide crater caps the summit of the dominantly andesitic-dacitic volcano, the flanks of which are covered by monogenetic centres especially to the northwest. Bazman is a geologically young volcano which was made in the Quaternary, with the oldest dated rocks being 11.7 million years old and the youngest 0.6 million years. Although no historic eruptions have been reported from Bazman, it does contain fumaroles. Thus Bazman may be regarded as dormant, rather than extinct. Its satellite cones have been the source of basaltic lava flows. Bazman volcano is part of a volcanic arc in southeastern Iran, the Makran volcanic arc. At this arc, shallow subduction has generated an arc of volcanic activity which includes Bazman, Taftan and Koh-i-Sultan volcanoes. The volcano has been affected by heavy erosion. The flanks of the volcano are covered with debris coming from the volcano. A Cretaceous pluton is also associated with Bazman and has been investigated for the possibility of mining."

  "text" : "Ben Avon (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Athfhinn) is a mountain in the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland. The highest point of the massif, known as Leabaidh an Dàimh Bhuidhe (bed of the yellow stag) is classified as both a Munro and a Marilyn. Ben Avon is a very large and complex mountain sprawling over more than 30 km². The summit plateau is dominated by granite tors, one of which forms the summit. From the broad summit plateau ridges lead in almost every direction, allowing access from Glen Avon to the north, from Beinn a' Bhùird to the west and from Gleann an t-Slugain in the south. To the west of the summit lies the massive corrie, Slochd Mòr, with its rocky cliffs, and the approaches from the south and west take you close to the corrie rim. The most common ascent route is via the path in the deep glen that separates Ben Avon and Beinn a' Bhùird, or from Beinn a' Bhùird itself. The summit tor itself must be climbed in order to \"bag\" the mountain, though it is an easy scramble."

These monadnocks are peculiarly shaped results of volcanic activity, formed before the period wherein Pannonia was an active geologic unit. Badacsony is the central part of the Badacsony wine region. On the Badacsony mountain, poet Sándor Kisfaludy lived and first met his wife, Róza Szegedy. This event is commemorated by a small exhibition in a house on the mountain, the Róza Szegedy house, whilst the former house of Kisfaludy himself is now a restaurant. Badacsony has a ferry landing, with regular departures to Fonyód via a catamaran ferry the \"Badacsony\"."

  "text" : "Black Combe is a fell in the south-west corner of the Lake District National Park, just four miles from the Irish Sea. It lies near the west coast of Cumbria in the borough of Copeland and more specifically, in the ancient district of Millom. It is 1970 feet (600m) high and stands in isolation, some 10 miles away from any higher ground; this factor offers an excellent all-round panoramic view of land and sea; weather permitting. Black Combe is a Marilyn and, at 600m, it is only 10m short of being a Hewitt. Sub-tops include White Combe, Stoupdale Head, Swinside Fell and Stoneside Hill. The first two but not the last two are included in the index of Wainwright's The Outlying Fells of Lakeland and thus in lists of \"Outlying fells\". (All four sub-tops are shown on Wainwright's map of the fell in that book The view from Black Combe is unique, a result of its isolated position to the south and west of the main Lake District fells. William Wordsworth claimed that \"the amplest range of unobstructed prospect may be seen that British ground commands.\" Half the view is the glittering sea, with the Isle of Man seen clearly to the west, and the hills of Wales and Scotland seen as shadowy silhouettes. On the seaward side views extend from the Cumbrian coast, and from Criffel, 49 miles to the north, a mountain on the Scottish coast near Dumfries, round to the Isle of Man, 45 miles due west, then round to Snowdon which may be seen on days of exceptionally good visibility, 85 miles to the south, to the coast of Lancashire. On the landward side; views include the Scafell Group and the Coniston Group of fells in the Lake District National Park, including four 3000-foot mountains: Skiddaw, Scafell, Scafell Pike and Helvellyn. To the east and south the Pennine Hills, the Forest of Bowland and Blackpool Tower are visible. Closer by, there are also good views over the Duddon Estuary, Millom and the new wind farm just offshore. Black Combe is easy to see across Morecambe Bay as the most westerly outlying fell of the Lake District National Park. The name of the Cumberland View public house in Morecambe reflects the fact that Black Combe used to stand in the historical county of Cumberland. It can also be seen from the top end of the Wirral peninsula, between the turbines of the new Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm. Clearly visible in views of Black Combe from the south and east is the large, dark-coloured glacial corrie, known as Blackcombe, from which the fell's name is derived. Such corries are often known as combes in English place names, a word cognate with the Welsh word cwm. Adjacent to Blackcombe is a lighter-coloured corrie called Whitecombe. Black Combe was one of the five stations in Cumberland used by the Ordnance Survey to measure the angles of Principal Triangles for their initial survey of Britain in the years up to and including 1809. The other stations were \"Dent Hill\", Scilly Banks (on the outskirts of Whitehaven), High Pike and Cross Fell. The Black Combe Walking Festival takes place annually in June and the Black Combe fell race takes place in early March. The Swinside, or Sunken Kirk, stone circle is on the eastern flanks of Swinside Fell, in the north east of Black Combe."

Although included in Sir Hugh Munro's original list of Scottish mountains over 3000 feet, subsequent surveys showed it to be significantly shorter than the 914.4 m cut-off limit required to count as a Munro. Nonetheless, it remains a popular mountain, and is often quoted as an example of an interesting mountain below 3000 feet to show that there is more to mountaineering in Scotland than just Munro-bagging. Beinn an Lochain is usually climbed from the car park at Butterbridge, on the A83 road, at the head of Glen Kinglas. From there, the summit is reached after a 2.5 km walk along the mountain's north-east ridge, climbing over 700 m."

Its forests were once used as a major source of timber for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's rail ties. For this reason, the Winchester and Western Railroad was constructed through the Capon Valley in the 1920s to haul the timber harvested in the region to Winchester, Virginia for railroad tie production. The communities of Capon Lake and Intermont lie at the foot of Baker Mountain on the Cacapon."

It is located about 50 km (30 mi) northeast of the town of Chitral, and about 50 km (30 mi) east of Tirich Mir (7,708 m), the highest peak in the Hindu Kush. In 1957, the New Zealanders W.K.A. Berry and C.H. Tyndale-Biscoe accomplished the first ascent of the Main Peak of Buni Zom from the steep razorlike north ridge The second ascent was in 1975 by Japaneses Masao Okabe, Hideo Sato and Shigeru Tabe and third ascent was in 1979 by Americans Joe Reinhard and Richard J. Isherwood both from south face. The Buni Zom group has many other peaks, some of which have been climbed. There are 12 peaks over 6,000 m (19,700 ft) in the Buni Zom group which are unclimbed Himalayan Index."

For perhaps hundreds of years, and since at least the early 20th century, mysterious illuminations known as the Brown Mountain Lights have been seen there. The lights are small balls that appear irregularly over Brown Mountain. There are literally hundreds of eyewitness accounts of the lights, and they have merited two investigations by the United States Geological Society. It is known that they have been seen by residents of the surrounding area since at least the 19th century, but the Cherokee Native Americans of the area may have been seeing the lights as early as the 13th century. When present, the Brown Mountain lights can be seen from as far away as Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and have been reported to rise to a fair height above the ridge, before disappearing in a 'silent explosion' like a Roman candle. The lights are best seen from Wiseman's view or Linville Falls."

The nature reserve on the hill is internationally renown as a major hang gliding and paragliding site. It was on the beach below Bald Hill that Lawrence Hargrave, an Australian pioneer of flight, experimented with box kites in the early part of the 20th century.

The B6277 road between Alston and Middleton-in-Teesdale passes within 2 km of the summit, thus providing the easiest route of ascent. The hill may also be climbed from Weardale as part of high-level circuit of Burnhope Reservoir. The highest point of the hill lies in Cumbria, some 200 m west of a trig point on the border. There are some ski-tows on the northwest slopes of the hill - this forms the Yad Moss ski facility, which has recently been upgraded by Sport England. The entire area is designated \"access land\" under the terms of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000."

The chalk hill is part of the scarp of Dorset Downs, which form the western end of the Southern England Chalk Formation. Part of the hill is used for arable agriculture, but most is calcareous grassland. The hill overlooks the Blackmore Vale, and offers views of Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire and Devon. Rawlsbury Camp, a five acre Iron Age hill fort, is situated on a promontory of the hill. Little remains of the camp except the twin embankments and intermediate ditch which surrounded it. The hill gets its name from the several barrows that adorn the hill. Additionally, a medieval trackway crosses the ridge. A more recent addition is the twin radio transmitter towers used by the emergency services. The hill is a popular launch site for paragliders. The TV presenter Jack Hargreaves who died in 1994 had his ashes spread on Bulbarrow Hill above his home, Raven Cottage."

  "text" : "Beinn Narnain (sometimes anglicised as Ben Narnain) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, near Arrochar. It forms part of a group of hills known (unofficially) as the Arrochar Alps, and is a Munro. The name Beinn Narnain means \"hill of notches\", and describes the mountain's notched profile. Beinn Narnain is usually climbed from Succoth at the head of Loch Long. The most commonly used route starts by climbing directly up the hillside, following a line of concrete blocks that were originally supports for a cable railway used during the construction of watercourse diversions forming part of the Loch Sloy hydro-electric scheme (Until the construction of new path, this was also the route towards The Cobbler). At one point the path crosses a level track, and one must continue by climbing some exposed rock immediately opposite - this appears to be part of the stream bed and not the path. Where the concrete blocks cease, the path continues up Beinn Narnain's craggy south ridge. There are several mild scrambling sections, which provide an enjoyable experience for the casual walker. The route bypasses some impressive and, when shrouded in mist at least, apparently almost impassable crags - \"The Spearhead\" - by means of a steep gully immediately before the summit. The final stages of the climb include some mild exposure, but this should not intimidate a hillwalker of even limited experience. Beinn Narnain's northern ridge drops down to the Bealach a' Mhàim, a three-sided bealach with other ridges leading to The Cobbler and Beinn Ìme. An ascent of Beinn may thus easily be extended to give a longer day on the Arrochar Alps."

  "text" : "Bukhansan, or Bukhan Mountain, is a mountain on the northern periphery of Seoul, South Korea. There are three major peaks, Baegundae 836.5 meters (2,744 ft), Insubong 810.5 meters (2,659 ft), Mangyeongdae 787.0 meters (2,582.0 ft). Because of its height and the fact that it borders a considerable portion of the city, Bukhansan is a major landmark visible from most city districts. The name \"Bukhansan\" means \"mountain north of Han River\", referring to the fact that it is the northern border of the city. During the Joseon era, the peaks marked the extreme northern boundary of Seoul. Bukhansan is the highest mountain within Seoul city boundaries. Apart from Bukhansan, there are seven other mountains including Dobongsan and Suraksan that are over 600 meters high within the city. Popular throughout the year, Bukhansan, and Bukhansan National Park, which was formed in 1983, are renowned for birdwatching, hiking and rockclimbing. Bukhansan attracts a large number of hikers; around 5 million per year."

  "text" : "Big Four is a mountain in the Cascade Range, located about 20 miles (32 km) east of Granite Falls, Washington. Debris piles on the mountain's northern flank form as a result of avalanche activity. These fields of disturbed snow are able to remain year round in the shadow of the mountain. During the summer months snow-melt streams flow beneath the debris piles and cause caves to form in the ice. The caves vary in size from season to season and are unpredictably dangerous. The mountain is open to the public and a large snowfield can be reached by a short trail, but the snowfield itself is off-limits due to cave-ins and slides which have killed hikers in incidents in 1998, 2010, and 2015."

  "text" : "Beinn Dearg (one of a number of Scottish hills of that name) is a mountain in the Inverlael area of the Highlands of Scotland. It is most frequently climbed by following the River Lael up Gleann na Sguaib. Starting from near the head of Loch Broom a path follows the glen to a bealach about a kilometre north of the summit. From this bealach, the neighbouring peaks of Con a' Mheall and Meall na Ceapraichean may also be climbed. Eididh nan Clach Geala, which lies about 3 km north of Beinn Dearg is also added in to complete a round of 4 Munros. During early 2005, strong winds caused much damage to trees in the Inverlael Forest, almost completely blocking the route described. Beinn Dearg is designated as a Special Protection Area. The area encompasses a diverse range of habitats, including woodland, mire, open water, dwarf-shrub heath, and cliffs. Most significantly, the summit areas support specialist montane birds such as breeding dotterel Charadrius morinellus and golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos."

Until 1950, when it was renamed in honour of Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev, the peak was called Yumrukchal (Юмрукчал, from Ottoman Turkish Yumrukçal, 'a fist-like peak'). A weather station and a radio tower (opened on 10 July 1966) that covers 65% of the country are located on Botev Peak. The average temperature is −8.9 °C (16.0 °F) in January and 7.9 °C (46.2 °F) in July. \"Botev Peak\" is the main facility of Bulgarian FM and TV broadcasting network. The situation at the top near the geographical center of Bulgaria contribute to national radio broadcasts and television broadcast here to cover more than 65% throughout the country, also in parts of Romania and Turkey."

Although lying mostly within Zimbabwe, the mountains extend north-east into Mozambique.

  "text" : "Beinn Ghlas is a mountain in the Southern Highlands of Scotland. It lies on the north shore of Loch Tay and is part of the Ben Lawers Range. It lies on the popular path to Ben Lawers from the National Trust for Scotland car park, with the result that many walkers traverse the summit of Beinn Ghlas without realising it. The popularity of the path meant that it suffered from severe erosion, but it has been reconstructed in recent years. The Gaelic name is translated as 'grey-green mountain', which refers to the colour of the mica-schist that makes up the bulk of the mountain and that falls as a scree on its south-western side. The path up the mountain leads past outcrops of this rock that also reveal large garnets. As mentioned above, the usual route to the summit leaves from the car park, follows Edramucky Burn, and climbs to the south-western ridge of the mountain. The deep corrie of Coire Odhar (the dun-coloured corrie) lies to the north. Walkers who continue on to Ben Lawers can avoid the 100 metre re-ascent of Beinn Ghlas on their return by taking the path that runs west of the summit, down to Coire Odhar."

Black Down is an open-access area mostly consisting of moors, with dense cover of associated vegetation such as heather and bracken. According to a local organization's newsletter, the name \"Black Down\" comes from the Saxon word 'Blac' or 'Bloec' meaning bleak, 'Dun' meaning down or fort."

It is the home of Blue Mountain coffee and their famous tours. It is located on the border of the Portland and Saint Thomas parishes of Jamaica. The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile (10 km) hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot (1,000 m) increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance. Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort. This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the peak."

  "text" : "Black Butte is a stratovolcano (not a cinder cone) 5.5 miles (8.9 km) west of Sisters, Oregon in Deschutes National Forest. Black Butte looks young, as it is barely eroded (except for little gullies a little bit above the base that were carved by long-gone streams). Mount Washington, which is visible from the summit of Black Butte, looks much more eroded, and older, than Black Butte. However, Black Butte is significantly older than Mount Washington which was eroded by glaciers, but Black Butte is east of the Cascade crest and does not receive enough precipitation to support glaciers, so erosion is minimal. It is an extinct volcano composed of basaltic andesite. The cone rises 3,076 feet (938 m) over the surrounding plateau. Black Butte is a striking feature just north of US Highway 20, which descends from the east flank of the Cascades. It is nearly symmetrical,with no marks of glaciation. Even though it is older than the High Cascades mountains visible to the west, which are heavily scoured by ice-age glacier activity, Black Butte receives less snow at its lower elevation and location east of the High Cascades. The headwaters of the Metolius River flow from Metolius Springs near the northern base of Black Butte. The spring flows at a consistent rate of 45,000 to 50,000 US gallons (170 to 190 m3) per minute. In the local indigenous tongue, the mountain is called Turututu, but records show settlers calling it Black Butte as early as 1855. Forest Service road 1110 climbs halfway up the mountain and a hiking trail continues to the summit.At the summit, there are two fire lookout towers, one that was built in 1934 and is condemned, and another that was constructed in 1995 to replace the older one. The older is the taller of the two."

  "text" : "Big Hatchet Peak is the high point of the Big Hatchet Mountains, a small but rugged range in the southwest corner (the \"Bootheel\") of New Mexico, in the United States. The mountains are located in southeast Hidalgo County, about 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Deming. The range runs roughly northwest-southeast, and is about 12 miles (19 km) long; the southeastern edge of the range is within 3.5 miles (6 km) of the border with Mexico. They lie primarily on BLM land. The peak rises steeply out of the Playas Valley, to the west, and the Hachita Valley, to the east of the range. The summit stands about 4,000 feet above the valley floors. Also, the north and west faces of the peak are particularly steep, making for an impressive mountain. There are a few other minor summits in this small range, but most are not named, except for New Well Peak with a summit elevation of 6,284 feet (1,915 m) and which anchors the southeast end of the mountains. Geologically this range is part of the Basin and Range Province which spans much of the southwestern U.S. and parts of northern Mexico. It is a fault-block range made up of Paleozoic limestone and Cretaceous shale and sandstones. Ecologically, the Big Hatchet Mountains lie near the Chihuahuan Desert and the Sonoran Desert, but their large relief provides many ecological niches more in keeping with the mountains to the north. Notable inhabitants include bats, raptors, bighorn sheep, and javelina. The Big Hatchet Mountains are far from population centers, and have no paved road access or developed recreation sites; they therefore see little recreational activity. However the standard route on the peak, along the South Ridge from Thompson Canyon, is straightforward."

The mesa extends in a north-southerly direct with a length of 23 kilometres (14 mi) and a width of 11 kilometres (6.8 mi). Billingen is divided into two parts by an east-west valley between Skövde and Varnhem. The mesa plateau is covered with vast forests and moorlands, including the nature reserve Blängsmossen with its unique flora. The limestone at Billingen has been quarried for a long time for concrete manufacturing; diabase is also still quarried there; The mesa, located between the two great lakes Vänern and Vättern, is also a popular nature resort with several nearby hotels, and an annual orienteering tournament is held here. The town of Skövde is built partially on the slopes of Billingens and the town center lies at the foot of the mesa. Some additional local points of interest are Jättadalen (a dramatic ravine with a waterfall), Silverfallen, and the \"caves of Ryd\" which are better described as free-standing pillars of diabase."

  "text" : "Baltoro Kangri (also known as the Golden Throne) is a mountain of the Karakoram mountain range in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. Baltoro Kangri is the 82nd highest mountain in the world with an elevation of 7,312 metres (23,990 ft). It lies to the south of the Gasherbrums and east of Chogolisa Peak (7,665 m). The huge Baltoro Glacier (which is one of the largest glaciers outside polar regions) rises from the foot of Baltoro Kangri. In the north of Baltoro Kangri is the Abruzzi Glacier. In 1963, a Japanese expedition made the first ascent of Baltoro Kangri. The expedition consisted of nine members from the Tokyo University Alpine Ski Club, which was led by Seihei Kato."

  "text" : "Baring Mountain, or Mount Baring, is a peak in the central part of the Cascade Range of Washington, United States. It lies about 2 miles (3 km) northeast of the Skykomish River and US Highway 2, at the western edge of the Cascades in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. It is about 6 miles (9.7 km) east of Mount Index and Barclay Lake at its base is accessible via Forest Road 6024 and a 2.2-mile (3.5 km) hike. Baring Mountain was previously known as Mount Index before being renamed in 1917. The peak currently named Mount Index was known as West Index Mountain until that time. Like Mount Index, Baring Mountain is a dramatic peak, because of its steep rise above low footings, the Skykomish River is at an elevation of only 760 feet (230 m), and particularly because of its large, sheer Northeast Face, which drops about 750 m (2,460 ft) in only 250 m (820 ft) and drops another 1250 ft at a lower angle to Barclay Lake. The first recorded ascent of Baring Mountain was on July 28, 1897 by John Charlton and Albert H. Sylvester. However given the nontechnical nature of the easiest ascent route a much earlier Native American ascent is possible. The standard route on the mountain is the Northwest Ridge Route, involving hiking (off-trail, some of it through brush) and a small amount of scrambling at the top. The northeast aspect of the peak is home to several routes of great length and technical difficulty (up to Grade V, 5.10). The northeast face was first climbed on July 13, 1960 by Ed Cooper and Don Gordon Claunch. The first BASE jump off Baring Mountain was done by Todd Higley and Josh Whipple, in August 2001. Michael McMurtrey, of Seattle, was the first to jump from Baring using a wingsuit, in June 2004. \n* BASE Wingsuit Picture: First BASE wingsuit jumps off Baring Mountain (June, 2004) \n* BASE Wingsuit Picture: First BASE wingsuit jumps off Baring Mountain (June, 2004) \n* BASE Wingsuit Picture: Recent BASE wingsuit jump off Baring Mountain (September, 2010)"

Its two summits rise above the Hudson River behind the city and can easily be seen from Newburgh across the river and many other places in the region. The more accessible northern peak, at 1,531 feet (467 m) above sea level, has a complex of radio antennas on its summit; the 1,610-foot (491 m) southern summit has a fire lookout tower. Beacon Reservoir, the city's main water source, is located between North Beacon and neighboring Scofield Ridge, the highest peak in Putnam County. Since much of the land on the mountains and up to the county line is owned by the city to protect the watershed, an extensive system of roads and trails makes it a popular hiking area. Both summits afford extensive views of the mid-Hudson region, and on clear days New York City is visible from the fire tower."

A hunting party drove the bull over the hill. In an attempt to flee the mountaineers, the bull plunged out into space and fell down. Its broken and shapeless mass on the rocks was memorialized in the name of the mountain the bull used to haunt. While not as well known as neighboring Breakneck Ridge or Storm King Mountain across the river, it too is part of Hudson Highlands State Park and has an extensive trail system and offers hikers sweeping views of the river and neighboring peaks from rock outcrops near its wooded 1,420-foot (433 m) summit, higher than both neighbors."

The mountain is a popular hike for locals, as it offers an unimpeded view of the prairies. A lookout was built by Alberta Forest Service on the summit in 1929, and was in service until 1959. Black Rock Mountain was named in 1958 for its black appearance, particularly from the east."

The vast summit plateau is home of one of Britain's highest bodies of standing water, Lochan a' Garbh Coire. It is the 25th highest Munro, and due to its remote location, one of the less frequently visited. Situated 19 km from Dalwhinnie and 15 km from Corrour railway station, it is commonly climbed in a two-day expedition, usually taking in its lower neighbour, Beinn Bheoil. There are two bothies near to the mountain: Culra Lodge to the northeast and Ben Alder Cottage to the south, both potentially providing shelter for walkers in the area. Ben Alder Cottage is reputed to be haunted by the ghost of a ghillie who hanged himself from the rafters. If a mountain bicycle is used on, or permission is obtained to drive on the track along the north west shore of Loch Ericht, Ben Alder is one of six Munros that a fit climber may be able to summit on a single late spring or early summer day."

  "text" : "Bickerton Hill refers to two low red sandstone hills that form the southern end of the Mid Cheshire Ridge in Cheshire, north-west England. The high point, Raw Head, lies on the northerly hill and has an elevation of 227 metres. Parts of the southerly hill are also known as Larkton Hill. There is evidence of settlement on the hills dating from the neolithic or Bronze Age. The earthworks of an Iron Age hill fort, Maiden Castle, are located on the summit of the southerly hill; they are a Scheduled Monument. The hills have been quarried and mined for copper since the 17th century, and a grade-II-listed engine house chimney remains as a remnant of the mining industry. Several caves occur in the sandstone, some of which have a history of habitation. The Sandstone Trail, a long-distance footpath, runs along the ridge, and the area is popular with walkers. A large area of the southerly hill is protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its biological importance; much of this hill is owned by the National Trust. Its summit plateau has an extensive area of lowland heath, a rare habitat in Cheshire, and one that is particularly important for reptiles. A substantial population of Lobed Maidenhair Spleenwort, a fern that is rare in Britain, is found here. Nationally scarce species observed in the area include the bleached pug and alder kitten moths, and the Malthus frontalis species of soldier beetle. The western escarpment of the northerly hill has also been designated an SSSI for its exposed Triassic sandstones."

  "text" : "Bear Mountain is one of the best-known peaks of New York's Hudson Highlands. Located partially in Orange County in the town of Highlands and partially in Rockland County in the town of Stony Point, it lends its name to the nearby Bear Mountain Bridge and Bear Mountain State Park that contains it. Its summit, accessible by a paved road, has several roadside viewpoints, a picnic area and an observatory, the Perkins Memorial Tower. It is crossed by several hiking trails as well, including the oldest section of the Appalachian Trail (AT). As of 2015, the AT across Bear Mountain is continuing to be improved by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference to minimize erosion and improve accessibility and sustainability as part of a project to rebuild and realign the trail that began in 2006. The steep eastern face of the mountain overlooks the Hudson River. The eastern side of the mountain consists of a pile of massive boulders, often the size of houses, that culminate in a 50-foot (15 m) cliff face at approximately the 1,000-foot (300 m) level. A direct scramble from the shore of Hessian Lake to Perkins Memorial Drive on the summit requires a gain of about 1,000 feet (300 m) in roughly 0.8 miles (1.3 km). From the summit, one can see as far as Manhattan, and the monument on High Point in New Jersey."

  "text" : "Ben Venue (Scottish Gaelic: A' Bheinn Mheanbh) is a mountain in the Trossachs area of Scotland. The name Ben Venue is derived from the Scottish Gaelic words meaning \"the miniature mountain\". The summit lies approximately 2 kilometres south-west of the pier at the southern end of Loch Katrine. At the foot of the mountain close to the shore of Loch Katrine is Bealach nam Bò meaning the \"pass of the cattle\", a reference to the lawless days when Highland cattle \"lifters\" used the pass to drive stolen herds to their land. Ben Venue is a popular walk and can be accessed from either Ledard farm track at Loch Ard or from the car park at the head of Loch Achray: both routes are approximately 5 km in length. A sign in the forestry warns that the mountain should not be approached or descended directly to or from Loch Katrine, as the slopes on this side are very steep and littered with dangerous cliffs. Several indistinct paths do exist on this side of the hill however. Ben Venue has two summits a short distance apart. The triangulation pillar on the eastern summit has a height of 727 m above sea level, and this height is often given as the height of Ben Venue as a whole. However the western summit is shown to be slightly higher, 729 m, on the Ordnance Survey's 1:25000 map. From (either) summit on a clear day the view extend to the Firth of Forth, the Clyde and Isle of Arran and the Paps of Jura. Good views can be seen along Loch Katrine, Ben A'an, Ben More, Stob Binnein, Ben Lomond and the Arrochar Alps."

Most climbers approach the mountain from either the Bietschhornhütte or the Baltschiederklause. It was first climbed on 13 August 1859 by Leslie Stephen, with guides Anton Siegen, Johann Siegen and Joseph Ebener. An account of this first ascent was published by Leslie Stephen in his book The Playground of Europe (1871)."

  "text" : "Bobotov Kuk (Cyrilic: Боботов Кук) is a peak in northern Montenegro. At 2,523 m (8,278 ft), it is the highest peak in the Durmitor mountain range and had been thought to be the highest point in Montenegro. New surveys have shown there are three higher peaks on the border with Albania. Most Montenegrin mountains are visible from Bobotov Kuk, among them Lovćen (above the Adriatic Sea), Kopaonik and Tara (in Serbia), Maglić (in Bosnia and Herzegovina). The first recorded ascent of Bobotov Kuk was in 1883 by an Austrian cartographer, Oscar Baumann. The first organized mountaineering group from Zagreb came to Durmitor in 1926. In 1931 two Austrians completed the first winter ascent from Bezimeni Vrh."

  "text" : "Ben Vane (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mheadhain) is a Scottish mountain situated in the southern Highlands. The underlying geology almost entirely comprises the Beinn Bheula Schist Formation - Psammite and Pelite with a Siluro-Devonian Dyke prominent round the northern and eastern face. It is one of the Arrochar Alps and stands slightly separate from the other mountains of the group being connected on its western side to the neighbouring Beinn Ìme by a low col at 492 metres. Ben Vane itself just qualifies as a Munro reaching a height of 915 metres (3002 feet) and is characterised by steep and rugged slopes which fall away to the Inveruglas Water to the east and the Allt Coiregroigan to the south; to the north the descent is more undulating going over the subsidiary top of Beinn Dubh before falling to the valley at the north end of Loch Sloy. Dense forestry cloak the mountain on its lower southern slope in Allt Coiregroigan. Also on these southern slopes by the Allt Coiregroigan is a disused quarry which provided crushed stone used for the construction of the Loch Sloy dam in the late 1940s. The dam wall lies two km to the north of the quarry and a conveyor belt was constructed to carry the crushed stone over the lower slopes of Ben Vane to the batching plant beside the dam. The direct route up the mountain starts from the car park at grid reference NN322098 opposite the Loch Sloy power station on the banks of Loch Lomond and follows the private tarmac road by the Inveruglas Water up to the Loch Sloy hydro dam for two kilometres before striking steeply up the mountain's eastern ridge. Initially there is some boggy ground and some crags to avoid higher up but the top is easily reached after a few false summits on the way. Ben Vane can also be climbed in conjunction with some of the other Arrochar Alps especially Beinn Ìme and Beinn Narnain. The summit of the mountain is a small plateau crowned by a cairn. The highlights of the view from the top of Ben Vane are Ben Vorlich and Loch Sloy to the north east and the rest of the Arrochar Alps to the south west, A' Chrois looks especially fine across the deep glen of Allt Coiregrogain. The vista to Lochs Arklet and Katrine to the east is very good."

  "text" : "Ben Donich or Beinn Dòmhnaich is a mountain located in the Arrochar Alps, near Loch Goil in Argyll and Bute. It is a Corbett and part of the Ardgoil range with its sister The Brack. The closest settlement to Ben Donich is the village of Lochgoilhead. At 847 metres Ben Donich, is the highest mountain on the Ardgoil peninsula. It is a fairly extensive mountain, essentially a square pyramid with its summit at the centre of four ridges. Ben Donich can be accessed by any of its four ridges, but is almost entirely surrounded by forestry plantations in its lower slopes which makes access difficult. To the north-west a ridge runs down to Gleann Mòr, whilst a further ridge kicks off to the south of the summit, dropping down into the wooded glen containing the Donich Water river. By far the most frequented ridge is the south-east ridge which connects Ben Donich to The Brack via Bealach Dubh-lic at 384 metres where a footpath crosses over the ridge from Glen Croe to Lochgoilhead. A further insignificant ridge leads off the summit ridge to the north-east overlooking Glen Croe and the \"Rest and be Thankful\" summit on the A83. The slopes are moderate, and terrain is mainly grass with some rocky outcrops on steeper slopes. The summit (847 metres) of Ben Donich, at grid reference NN218043, also boasts an Ordnance Survey trig point."

The Scottish composer Ronald Stevenson composed a work for full chorus, chamber chorus, symphony orchestra and chamber orchestra based on MacIntyre's poem, entitled Moladh Beinn Dobhrain (In praise of Ben Dorain) in 2007. In this lyrical, tonal work, Stevenson used the original text and Hugh Macdiarmid's English translation of the verse. It was premiered on 19 January 2008 in Glasgow with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Scottish Opera Chorus, Glasgow University Chapel Choir and The Edinburgh Singers."

They were among the largest Holocene eruptions in Papua New Guinea. Both were explosive eruptions with a Volcanic Explosivity Index of at least 5. The 1580 AD ± 20 years eruption produced pyroclastic flows and probably formed its caldera. The ignimbrite deposit from that eruption, which had a VEI of 6, extends 22 kilometres (14 mi) from the caldera to the coast, and its volume is around 10 cubic kilometres (2.4 cu mi)."

  "text" : "Binnein an Fhidhleir, one of the Arrochar Alps, is a mountain in southern Scotland. It is located above Butterbridge on the north side the A83 road facing Beinn an Lochain to the south. The mountain has several tops, including Creag Bhrosgan (711 m); Stob Coire Creagach, which replaced Binnein an Fhidhleir as the Marilyn in April 2006  at 817 m; one without any name at all at 748 metre; and Binnein an Fhidhleir itself, further to the west, at 811 m. Although Stob Coire Creagach is the highest summit, the name Binnein an Fhidhleir is generally used for the whole mountain. The shortest route of ascent is directly up the hillside above Butterbridge, where there is a carpark. A number of small crags must be avoided, and the route is steep and unrelenting. Alternatively, the hill may be ascended from further up Glen Kinglas by way of Binnein an Fhidhleir's northern ridge: although longer this route is considerably less steep."

The fell is above Beacon Tarn and can be accessed from quiet paths off the main road from Water Yeat to Torver. Wainwright describes an ascent from Brown Howe, passing over the summit and down to Beacon Tarn (also visited on his Woodland Fell walk) before returning on the western slopes on the line of the Cumbria Way. Although it is relatively low, it has panoramic views of the Coniston Fells, Coniston Water and Morecambe Bay. It should not be confused with Beacon Fell in Lancashire."

  "text" : "Beinn Damh is a Scottish mountain situated in the wild mountainous area between Upper Loch Torridon and Glen Carron, 25 kilometres north northeast of Kyle of Lochalsh. Beinn Damh is classed as a Corbett reaching a height of 903 metres (2,962 feet) failing to qualify as a Munro by eleven metres, despite this it is a fine mountain with a four kilometre long undulating summit ridge with three tops, it has steep slopes and crags with its eastern face being especially dramatic with huge buttresses and cliffs. The mountain has the conspicuous “Stirrup Mark” just to the south west of the summit, this is a semi circular area of white quartzite surrounded by grey rock which stands out when the mountain is viewed from the south west. The mountains translated name of “Hill of the Stag” is apt because it stands in the middle of the Ben Damh deer estate."

  "text" : "Brammah is a mountain massif in the Kishtwar Himalayas of Jammu and Kashmir, India, east of the town of Kishtwar and near the border with Himachal Pradesh. It comprises four peaks, listed in order from west to east: \n*  Brammah I, 6,416 m (21,050 ft), first ascent 1973 \n*  Flat Top, 6,103 m (20,023 ft), first ascent 1980 \n*  Brammah II, 6,485 m (21,276 ft), first ascent 1975  \n*  Arjuna, 6,230 m (20,440 ft), first ascent 1983 Note that Brammah II is the highest of the group, contrary to usual practice. While Brammah I is not the highest, it is the most dramatic, as it is situated at the western end of the massif, above a low base. Brammah I is particularly notable both for its huge rise above local terrain and for its being the site of the first successful major climb in the Kishtwar Himalaya. British mountaineer Chris Bonington, along with Nick Estcourt, and aided by the Indian Institute of Skiing and Mountaineering, made the first ascent of Brammah I in 1973 via the Southeast Ridge. Estcourt notes that \"it is not the highest peak in Kishtwar, but it is the most obvious and elegant.\" The second ascent of Brammah I in 1978 was also made by a British group, comprising Paul Belcher, Duncan Nicholson, Jon Scott, and Anthony Wheaton. Unfortunately Nicholson and Scott perished on the descent. Anthony Wheaton returned to the sister mountain, Brammah's wife in 1979 and made the first British ascent with Richard Hester on September 16, 1979."

The mountain lies in the east of Assynt, set apart from the area's better known and more dramatic (but lower) mountains such as Suilven. It is hidden from the traveller on the A837 road by the adjacent Munro of Conival, and the best views of it are obtained from nearby summits. The higher slopes of the mountain are capped by light coloured quartzite boulders, giving it a distinctive appearance. Over 90 km² of land around Ben More Assynt have been declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) because of their geological interest and rare plant species."

Its composition is mainly of sandstone, limestone and shale. At its highest point, Benaughlin is 373 metres (1,224 ft) above sea level. A section of the Ulster Way passes around the side of the mountain, within 300 m of the summit. The name Benaughlin comes from the Irish: Binn Eachlabhra which means \"peak of the speaking horse\". Legends tell of a large, white horse (An Chopail Bán) which would appear on the slopes of the mountain each year on the last Sunday of July, and talk to local people. The mountain is also known as Bin Mountain to local residents. The blanket bog which covers the mountain was used as a source of fuel for the wealthy landowners in the area who lived in the nearby stately home of Florence Court. A path known as the Donkey Trail meanders up the side of the mountain; this was the route used for bringing the turf down off the mountain side."

  "text" : "Bald Eagle Mountain – once known locally as Muncy Mountain – is a stratigraphic ridge in the Allegheny Mountains of central Pennsylvania, USA, running east of the Allegheny Front and northwest of Mount Nittany. It lies along the southeast side of Bald Eagle Creek, and south of the West Branch Susquehanna River, and is the westernmost ridge in its section of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. The ridge line separates the West Branch Susquehanna Valley from the Nippenose and White Deer Hole Valleys, and Bald Eagle Valley from Nittany Valley. Bald Eagle Mountain lies in the central portion of Centre County, the southern portion of Clinton County, the southern portion of Lycoming County, and the ridge line forms part of the border between Blair County and Huntingdon County. It runs from the water gap formed with Brush Mountain by the Little Juniata River at Tyrone, to the bend in the West Branch Susquehanna River just east of Williamsport, a distance of approximately 60 miles (100 km). The Julian and Unionville Pikes are paved roads that cross the ridge near State College, along with and U.S. Route 322 and Interstate 99 which pass through the now enlarged wind gap known as \"Skytop\". Most other major road crossings are through gaps, including Interstate 80 which passes through the Curtin Gap east of Milesburg, Pennsylvania. There are water gaps in the ridge formed by Spring Creek in Milesburg and Fishing Creek in Mill Hall (where U.S. Route 220 crosses). U.S. Route 15 crosses south of Williamsport near Bald Eagle Mountain's eastern end. Bald Eagle Ridge is popular with soaring birds and glider pilots ridge soaring along its slopes. This ridge is part of a chain of ridges that stretch south to Tennessee. The Ridge Soaring Gliderport lies at the foot of this ridge between Julian and Unionville. A mature oak and hickory forest covers the Bald Eagle Mountain.It is one of the best sites in the eastern United States for viewing the migration of the golden eagle."

The western ridge line separates the Logan Valley from the Sinking Valley. Brush Mountain lies entirely in Blair County. It runs from the water gap formed with Bald Eagle Mountain by the Little Juniata River at Tyrone, south to the Sinking Valley anticline fold near Altoona then north to the Canoe Valley syncline fold, where the ridge becomes Canoe Mountain, a distance of approximately 30 miles (44 km). No major roads or rivers cross the ridge or run through gaps. Kettle Reservoir collects surface runoff from a small area in the fold, and the dam was made by filling in a small ravine. Kettle Road, a secondary road, also runs through the ravine near the dam to the Sinking Valley. A major power transmission line crosses the ridge twice, midway between the folds. The Brush Mountain Ridge is popular with soaring birds and glider pilots ridge soaring along its slopes. This ridge is part of a chain of ridges that stretch south to Tennessee. The fold at the south end of Brush Mountain forms a gap in the chain, with the continuation of the ridge line 10 km south on Dunning Mountain.

It lies within the boundaries of the Ansel Adams Wilderness; at the foot of the peak lie Garnet Lake, Lake Ediza, and the famous Thousand Island Lake. Banner Peak is near the town of Mammoth Lakes; from there, climbers can hike to the foot of the mountain where various routes reach the summit, the easiest of which is a class 2 from the west end of Thousand Island Lake and then the saddle between Banner Peak and the slightly taller Mount Ritter. Other nearby lakes include Lake Catherine and Shadow Lake. The peak was named in 1883 by USGS topographer Willard D. Johnson who observed a banner cloud streaming from the summit."

  "text" : "Black Mountain is a large hill which overlooks the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The mountain is one of the most prominent features of the city, towering above most of west Belfast. It reaches a height of 1,275 ft and is composed of basalt with limestone underneath, as is Cavehill further north. There have been flint finds in the area, which also contains raths, deserted farms and overgrown paths joining the fields and homesteads and trails scattered over the mountain. On a clear day there are views of Strangford Lough, the Mournes and the Sperrins, as well as Scotland and Donegal. There is a well-known field located on the Black Mountain, this is called the 'Hatchet Field', it is so called because it is in the shape of an old-fashioned hatchet. Also located on top of the mountain (Wolfe Hill) is a police barracks belonging to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Black Mountain transmitting station which is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility. One way to proceed up the mountain is by the 'Mountain Loney,' a path leading up the mountain and across the 'Hatchet Field'. This path is found adjacent to Dermot Hill, a housing estate in west Belfast, and is popular with walkers and tourists. For many years people have lobbied for the preservation of the Belfast Hills, hoping to bring an end to many years of quarrying. The quarry is steep and deeply excavated and the basalt from it is used mostly for road stone."

  "text" : "Beinn Fhada (Scottish Gaelic: long mountain) or Ben Attow is a mountain in the Scottish Highlands. The finest route up Beinn Fhada is from Morvich to the north-west. There is a direct line up a grassy, and rather boggy slope, from the east side of the River Croe. This leads eventually to a craggy and undulating ridge, which begins in a southerly direction over Sgurr a' Choire Ghairbh and then turns east across the wider expanse of the Plaide Mhòr to the summit. There is one short tricky section of downward scrambling on this ridge. An easy line of descent can be found, north-westwards from the summit, into Gleann Choinneachain. Total distance from Morvich is about 7 km, with around 1100 metres of ascent, including undulations. Beinn Fhada has been dismissed by some guide writers as boring. It has two remarkable features: the Plaide Mor is the largest extent of ancient (preglacial) land surface to survive in the western Highlands, and is of Cairngorm character. And its SW slopes into Gleann Lichd are seamed for 3 km with trenches reaching 10m high and 800m long, a slope deformation which is the largest 'rock slope failure'in the Highlands.

  "text" : "Besna Kobila (Serbian Cyrillic: Бесна Кобила, pronounced [bɛ̂ːsnaː kɔ̌bila], meaning \"mad mare\") is a mountain in southeastern Serbia and small ski center. Its eponymous highest peak has an elevation of 1,923 m. It lies 35 km to the east from the city of Vranje. There is a mountain chalet Besna Kobila from where it takes an hour to hour and a half to reach the summit on foot. It is known for its stormy weather, so the best months for climbing are during the warmer part of the year. Besna Kobila has 9 months of snow a year, which makes it suitable for ski tourism. As of 2010, there is only the mountain chalet, which has been used for accommodation of students. The \"skyway\" (nebeski put) – road running over the vast pastures on the highland – lies at the altitude of 1800 m and is suitable for mountain biking, safari bus and off-roading. There are ambitious plans to build a bigger ski center on the mountain, and the municipality is searching for foreign investors."

It is located directly adjacent to Interstate 5 at milepost 742 between the city of Mount Shasta and Weed, California. The highway crosses a 3,912 ft (1,192 m) pass, Black Butte Summit, at the western base of the lava domes. The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of Shastina following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000–10,000 years ago. A United States Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in the 1930s, but destroyed during the Columbus Day Storm of 1962. A new lookout was built in 1963 and operated until 1973. The building was moved by helicopter to a new location in 1975 and only the concrete foundation remains today. A 2.5-mile (4.0 km) long trail leads to the summit from a trailhead accessible by dirt roads off the Everitt Memorial Highway.The summit boasts an outstanding view of the southwest side of Shasta and Shastina, and on clear days Mount McLoughlin is easily visible 70 miles (113 km) to the north in Oregon."

Its summit, Lad Law, is 1,696 ft (517 m) above sea level, and commands views over Pendle Hill, the Forest of Bowland, the Yorkshire Dales and the South Pennines. On an exceptionally clear day it is possible to see Scafell Pike and Helvellyn to the north, Ferrybridge power station to the east, High Peak to the south and the Big One roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach to the west. The Brontë Way and the Pendle Way both pass along the slopes of Boulsworth Hill, providing routes of ascent from Nelson and Wycoller. A further possibility is to climb from Trawden, the nearest town to the summit, and it was originally intended that Boulsworth Hill would be a highlight of the Pennine Way, which instead passes to the east of the hill. Following the CRoW Act, Boulsworth Hill can now also be legally climbed from the Yorkshire side, near Hebden Bridge. The underlying rock is Millstone Grit, which is seen outcropping in several places and forming a steep scarp face along the summit. The hill is covered by acidic grassland, which provide a valuable breeding ground for red grouse, twite, golden plover and other birds. It lies just inside Lancashire, although the county boundary with the West Yorkshire district of Calderdale passes just a mile to the southeast of Lad Law."

The peak of Belknap Mountain is the highest point in the county. Although of only modest elevation, the isolation of the Belknap Mountains gives Belknap Mountain 1,850 ft (560 m) of relative height above the low ground separating it from the White Mountains, making it one of the fifty most topographically prominent peaks in New England. Belknap Mountain is flanked to the northwest by Gunstock Mountain, the site of the Gunstock Mountain Resort ski area. The summit of Belknap Mountain features an active fire tower. Belknap Mountain stands within the watershed of the Merrimack River, which drains into the Gulf of Maine in Massachusetts. The east and northeast sides of Belknap Mountain drain into Poorfarm Brook, thence into Lake Winnipesaukee, the Winnipesaukee River, and the Merrimack. The west side drains into Gunstock River, thence into Lake Winnipesaukee. The south side drains into Manning Lake, thence into Crystal Lake, the source of the Suncook River, and thence into the Merrimack River."

At 491 m, it is the highest of the seven 'Marilyn' hills on Islay, and the highest point on the island. It is located in the south east of Islay in the Ardtalla Estate. One possible approach is from Ardtalla: Start by following the path north towards Proaig, then turn west towards Beinn Bheigier. Once some height is gained turn northwest to walk around the hill towards Bealach Corrach. Walk west towards the bealach, then steeply climb up to reach the summit. A trig point marks the summit. On a clear day views include the Isle of Jura with the Paps of Jura, Kintyre, the Isle of Arran and most of Islay."

It was in a bog in the northern foothills of Bera Mawr, at a place called Nanhysglain, that Prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd and his family were betrayed and captured in June 1283 during the Conquest of Wales by Edward I. In October, Dafydd was executed at Shrewsbury on the orders of Edward I.

  "text" : "Big Jay is a 3,786 ft (1,154 m) mountain in the northern Green Mountains of Vermont, located on the border of Franklin and Orleans counties. The summit of Big Jay is the highest point of Franklin County. Big Jay is flanked to the south by Little Jay (3,182 ft or 970 m), and to the northeast by Jay Peak (3,865 ft or 1,178 m), the highest summit of the Jay Peak complex.Jay Peak is named for John Jay (1745–1829) of New York, one of the \"founding fathers\" of the United States. Big Jay stands within the watershed of the Trout River, a tributary of the Missisquoi River, which drains into Lake Champlain, thence into Canada's Richelieu River, the Saint Lawrence River, and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.The east and southeast sides of Big Jay drain into Jay Brook, which joins the South Branch Trout River in Montgomery to form the Trout River. The southwest and western sides of Big Jay drain into Hannah Clark Brook, and thence into the Trout. The northern end of Big Jay drains into Black Falls Brook, and thence into the Trout. There is no official hiking trail on Big Jay, although there is a herd path to the summit from Jay Peak. There is also a summit register. In the summer of 2007 two men cut an illegal ski trail several hundred yards down the eastern side of the protected habitat. The offense carries a maximum $5,000 fine and five years in jail. Hikers and skiers have been encouraged to stay away from the scar caused by the vandalism so that the area can recover."

  "text" : "The Barn Bluff is a mountain located in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania, Australia. The mountain is situated in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park at the junction of the eastern most points of the Murchison and Mackintosh river catchments. At 1,559 metres (5,115 ft) above sea level it is the fourth highest mountain in Tasmania, exceeding the height of the more famous Cradle Mountain by 14 metres (46 ft). The Barn Bluff is frequently snow-covered, sometimes even in summer. This mountain is perhaps the most prominent peak of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park and is visible from most areas and stands on its own, well away from other peaks. It is a popular venue for bushwalkers and mountain climbers, accessible via a side trip from the Overland Track. The path is moderate to difficult and has very steep sections, with boulder scrambling toward summit. The route is marked by cairns. The mountain was formed by glacial action and erosion and is characterised, for the most part, by the dolerite slabs and boulders typical of the alpine regions of the state. Many of the summits in Tasmania are rather obscure tors perched only slightly higher than the alpine plateau on which they sit. Barn Bluff, like Cradle Mountain, presents a classic summit. The mountain’s nearest neighbours are quite distant and, therefore, the 360 degree panorama from the summit is uninterrupted and spectacular."

  "text" : "Black Cap is a mountain located in the town of Conway, New Hampshire, United States. It is located between Kearsarge North Mountain and Peaked Mountain. The rocky summit provides views of Maine and New Hampshire's White Mountains. Cranmore Mountain Resort is located on its western subpeak, Cranmore Mountain. Black Cap is part of a north-south-trending ridge known as the Green Hills. The next summit to the north on the ridge (towards Kearsarge North) is 2,100-foot (640 m) Hurricane Mountain, and to the southwest is 1,857-foot (566 m) Middle Mountain. Black Cap is located entirely in the watershed of the Saco River, which flows to the Gulf of Maine (Atlantic Ocean) near Saco, Maine. Tributaries of the Saco that flow off the mountain include Artist Brook to the west, Mason Brook to the south, White Lot Brook to the southeast, and Weeks Brook to the east. Along the trail that leads to the top of Black Cap from Hurricane Mountain, there is a mountain biking trail created by NEMBA (New England Mountain Bike Association) called the Red Tail Trail. This trail descends further down Black Cap and Hurricane Mountain. It lets out near the intersection of Kearsarge Street and Hurricane Mountain Road (on the western side of Hurricane Mountain.)"

The peak is the second highest in the range after Cloud Peak, which is only 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the south, and the summit is located in the Cloud Peak Wilderness of Bighorn National Forest. The sharp dark profile of the mountain resembles a dark tooth or fang, hence the name. Because of the steep terrain, Black Tooth Mountain is one of the hardest mountains to climb in the Bighorns. Many of the trails up the mountain are unmarked which adds to the difficulty of reaching the summit. Mount Woolsey is an adjacent summit only .20 mi (0.32 km) to the southeast. Another high peak of the Bighorns known as Hallelujah Peak is situated along a knife-like ridge known as an arête .64 mi (1.03 km) to the northeast. Several tiny remnant glaciers can be found on the north slopes of Black Tooth Mountain."

  "text" : "Blacktail Butte (7,688 feet (2,343 m)) is a butte mountain landform rising from Jackson Hole valley in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. Blacktail Butte was originally named Upper Gros Ventre Butte in an early historical survey conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey. Most of Blacktail Butte is densely forested with a mixed fir forest of lodgepole pine, Douglas fir and Engelmann spruce, with scattered pockets of aspen. There are several large sedimentary rock outcroppings, which are used by rock climbers. This butte is a principal landmark in Jackson Hole, with much of the Jackson Hole valley floor and many portions of the Teton Range visible from its hillsides. Contrary to claims on some websites, black-tailed deer do not inhabit the region. Bighorn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, and bison are commonly found in the area, along with grizzly bears and gray wolves. Most notably, many thousands of elk cross through the area during their annual migration to and from their winter feeding grounds on the National Elk Refuge. \n* View of Blacktail Butte from the northeast \n* View of Blacktail Butte from the south Local lore claims that the name reflects the fact that the north face and ridge lines are so heavily wooded that they appear black, as compared to the other slopes, which have sage brush, scrub grass, and fewer trees. There is also a scenic overlook nearby with the same name, Blacktail Pond. At the base of the butte is Mormon Row, a popular place for photographers and tourists, with the photogenic Moulton Barn and herds of bison."

  "text" : "Black Balsam Knob, also known as Black Balsam Bald, is in the Pisgah National Forest southwest of Asheville, North Carolina, near milepost 420 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. It is the second highest mountain in the Great Balsam Mountains. The Great Balsams are within the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are part of the Appalachian Mountains. It is the 23rd highest of the 40 mountains in North Carolina over 6000 feet. The top of the mountain is a grassy bald that affords a panoramic view. The origin of grassy balds in southern Haywood county is a result of extensive clear-cut logging and locomotive fires in 1925 and 1942. These fires burned deep down into the mineral-rich topsoil slowing reforestation or stopping it altogether. Examples of this cannot only be found on Black Balsam knob, but many of its neighboring peaks and ridges. These unique features contribute greatly to the area's popularity, but the heavy amount of foot traffic also does further damage to this already fragile ecosystem. The Art Loeb Trail follows the grassy ridge of Black Balsam Knob. Visible peaks from Black Balsam Knob include: \n*  Shining Rock in the Shining Rock Wilderness (3 miles northeast) \n*  Looking Glass Rock (5 miles southeast) \n*  Cold Mountain (6 miles north) \n*  Mount Pisgah (9.5 miles northeast) \n*  Mount Mitchell. On exceptionally clear days, Mount Mitchell, the highest point in the Eastern United States, is visible 45 miles north east."

  "text" : "Basin is the ninth-highest peak of the High Peaks Region in the Adirondack Park in New York, United States. The peak was named by Verplanck Colvin for several basins formed between knobs on its slopes. It is located in the High Peaks Wilderness Area. A basin is an area of land enclosed by higher land. Basin Mountain is one of the highest peaks in the Great Range. Basin Mountain can be climbed from many trailheads in the Adirondacks. The shortest route to the peak starts at The Garden trailhead west of the village of Keene Valley. An excellent hike would be starting at the Roostercomb Trailhead in Keene Valley and climbing along the entire Great Range. There are very steep sections of open rock in the Great Range which make this very challenging. Also, the mileage and vertical rise are considerable, which would make this best be done as an overnight trip or a day trip with very light packs. The trail climbs up to a junction below the summit of Roostercomb. That is a four way intersection with a spur trail leading to Roostercomb and another leading to the Snow Mountain and the Ausable Valley. Straight ahead leads further up the Range toward Hedgehog Mountain. The side trips to Snow and Roostercomb should definitely be taken since those are nice open rocky peaks. Then continuing to Hedgehog and down the other side, there is probably the best camping area. The next day will be longer because the route takes you up Lower Wolf Jaw, Upper Wolf Jaw, Armstrong, Gothics, Saddleback, and Basin. The next day the trail would take you up and over Haystack to Panther Gorge and then up so Four Corners where Skylight and Marcy can be climbed. Other peaks after this can be climbed depending on the ending trailhead and the amount of time. Peaks in the area would include Gray, Redfield, Cliff, Colden, Allen, Phelps, Tabletop, Marshall, Iroquois, Algonquin, and Wright. Of course doing all those peaks would be pretty hard on top of the entire Great Range."

  "text" : "Big Slide is the twenty-seventh highest peak of the High Peaks Region of the Adirondack Park in New York. The peak was named for the prominent steep cliff that rises to its summit. It is located in the High Peaks Wilderness Area. Because it is relatively close to trail heads and because it offers a close view of the nearby Great Range, Big Slide is a popular day hiking destination. The most popular approach is via the Brothers, a set of rocky crags which offer several views on the way to the summit. It can also be climbed via the Slide Mountain Brook Trail from the Phelps trail in Johns Brook Valley, or combined with Yard Mountain via the Klondike Notch trail (Yard's elevation is 4018 feet, but it is not one of the High Peaks as it is too close to Big Slide)."

Local lore claims she was laid to rest atop the mountain so that she may forever face the land of her birth. An alternative version of events suggests the monument was dedicated to \"a gigantic woman in the days of Fingal\". Thomas Pennant climbed the hill while staying with Mackinnon of Corriechatachan (or Corry); Samuel Johnson and James Boswell did not."

It is a well-known feature, in part because of its height, but especially because of its bald summit (hence the name). Before aerial surveillance was extensively used, a hut was maintained on the summit for fire-spotting in the remote north-central part of the province. A very similar hut was maintained on Mount Carleton, the province's highest peak. Triangulation among these huts and other fire towers allowed the locations of wildfires to be determined quickly and easily."

  "text" : "Binnein Beag is a Scottish mountain situated at the eastern end of the Mamores range seven kilometres north north-east of Kinlochleven. It is a relatively small, conical peak which is connected to its larger neighbour, Binnein Mòr, by a bealach at 750m. Despite being overshadowed by Binnein Mòr, it is listed as a Munro with a height of 943 m (3094 ft). It is commonly climbed from Kinlochleven in combination with Binnein Mòr. Its summit gives good views of Ben Alder to the east, the Grey Corries to the north, and the vast bulk of Binnein Mòr to the south-west."

  "text" : "Ben Chonzie, also known as Ben-y Hone, (Gaelic Beinn a' Chòinnich, meaning \"mossy mountain\") is a Scottish mountain situated eleven kilometres northwest of Crieff. It stands at 931 m (3054 ft) and is therefore listed as a Munro. It is the highest point of a large area of moorland and rounded hills between Loch Earn and Loch Tay, and with a broad, flat summit and relatively few distinguishing features, it is often regarded as one of Scotland's least interesting Munros. It is most often climbed from Invergeldie (Comrie) to the southwest; however it can also be climbed from the southeast by way of Glen Turret. The latter is longer but presents walkers with a more interesting and scenic ascent, having an array of buttresses and cliffs which can be tackled by those who feel brave, or passed by on either side. Mountain hares (Lepus timidus, sub species Lepus timidus scoticus) can be seen around the plateau area if walkers are quiet and observant. There are also many other animals on the approaches to the Ben, including Buzzards, other birds of prey, and frogs and newts in the pools alongside the landrover track that runs up the eastern aspect of the loch. Deer may be seen on the slopes to the north of the Ben."

The western side of the hill is a fairly uniform steep, heathery slope, while the eastern side has a series of large, grassy corries and has been described as having more character. Numerous ascents of Ben Klibreck are possible. It can be climbed from Crask to the south or Altnaharra to the north, but the easiest and most popular route is from the A836 to the west, by way of Loch nan Uan and up steep slopes to the summit ridge, which is then followed to the summit."

The northwest side of Blake Peak drains into the East Branch of the Ausable River, between Upper and Lower Ausable Lakes. The Ausable River drains into Lake Champlain, which in turn drains into Canada's Richelieu River, the Saint Lawrence River, and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The southeast side of Blake Peak drains into the West Inlet of Elk Lake, thence into The Branch of the Schroon River, the Hudson River, and into New York Bay. Blake Peak was formerly thought to have an elevation of at least 4,000 ft (1,219 m), so it was included on the list of 46 Adirondack High Peaks. More recent surveys show Blake and three other peaks fell slightly short, but they remain on the list."

The base of Brandon Hill on the side of the River Barrow and the hill running to Graigue is composed of schist rock. This blackish siliceous schistus, sometimes containing grains of quartz and when it is broken it has a shivery texture and is hard enough to scratch glass.There are a few beds of marble and limestone gravel near the foot of the mountain. Evidence regarding the early settlement of the Brandon Hill upplands came to light as a result of a ground and aerial survey directed by Michael Gibbons, archaeologist with the Board of Works,in 1989. The survey indicated that the slopes of Brandon were settled in excess of four thousand years ago and that the cairns, house sites, field systems and a large ritual enclosure identified on its slopes are part of the prehistoric remains there. Two Norman moated sites, with long rectangular buildings attached - probably granges or farms attached to Duiske Abbey and thought to be about 600 years old - were also identified on the lower slopes in the Ballyogan townland area during the survey."

Most of the mountain is publicly owned, managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as part of the state Forest Preserve, part of the Big Indian-Beaverkill Range Wilderness Area in the Catskill Park. The summit is on a small corner of private land. As one of the High Peaks it is a popular destination for hikers, especially peakbaggers seeking membership in the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club, since along with Slide, Panther and Blackhead it is one of four peaks that members must climb twice, at least once in winter. The Pine Hill-West Branch Trail (PHWB) crosses its summit; hikers usually approach from either side via the Oliverea-Mapledale Trail, which intersects the PHWB south of the summit, and make the ascent from there. The northwestern approach makes a loop route possible via the Mine Hollow Trail; the southeastern ascent, from McKenley Hollow, has the steepest stretch of trail on any ascent of a Catskill High Peak."

  "text" : "Barva Volcano is an andesitic volcanic shield complex in central Costa Rica, 22 km north of San José, in Heredia Province. On the eastern side of the mountain it has a lake in what was the volcanic crater, called \"Laguna de Barva\", and in the western side it has three hills on the top which are called \"Las Tres Marías\". It is located in the small agricultural community of Sacramento. Barva has a dozen different eruptive spots in the summit and some parasitic cones on the flanks of the mountain. Its three principal summits visible from the Central Valley give it the common local name of Las Tres Marías (The Three Marys). Four pyroclastic cones are present within the 2 x 3 km caldera at the central and northwestern part of the summit. The southwestern peak contains four cones, one of which has a crater lake. The last confirmed eruptive activity at Barva Volcano has been dated to 8,050 years ago. There were reports of eruptions in the 1760s and in 1867, but investigations at the summit did not find evidence to confirm the reports."

  "text" : "Balsam Lake Mountain is one of the Catskill Mountains, located in the Town of Hardenburgh, New York, United States. It is the westernmost of the range's 35 High Peaks. Its exact height has not been determined, but the highest contour line on topographic maps, 3,720 feet (1,130 m), is usually given as its elevation. Located within the Balsam Lake Mountain Wild Forest management unit of the Catskill Park Forest Preserve, in the late 19th century its summit became the site of the first fire lookout tower in the state, operated by members of a nearby sportsmen's club. It was later taken over by the state's conservation agencies, which built several improved towers on the site, one of which remains, along with its accessory buildings and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, although it has not been used for fire detection since 1988. The summit is also the site of a rare sphagnum bog that has been affected by acid rain since a mid-20th century windstorm blew down many of the trees sheltering it at the time. The tower and the views it commands, as well as its ease of access by the old truck road to the tower, have made it a popular attraction for hikers despite the mountain's remote location. Many are peakbaggers aspiring to membership in the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club, for which Balsam Lake is a required peak."

The mountain is a bald, notable for its grassy summit and expansive views of the Hudson River Valley to the west. The 35 mi (56 km) Taconic Crest Trail traverses the mountain. Several other hiking trails approach the summit from the east. Much of the upper slopes and summit are within protected conservation land. Historically the lower slopes of the mountain were farmed heavily throughout the 19th Century. In addition to agriculture, there are several remants of charcoal kilns located on the mountain that produced fuel for iron smelting ."

Its 2,311-foot (704 m) main summit is located in New York; it is the highest point in that state's Dutchess County. The New York and Massachusetts portions of the mountain are within protected areas; Taconic State Park and Mount Washington State Forest respectively. The Connecticut portions are privately owned and conserved. It is a challenging yet popular hike since its summit, along with 2,304-foot (702 m) subpeak South Brace Mountain, are along the 15.7 mi (25.3 km) South Taconic Trail. Hikers approach the mountain either from the New York side on the west via the South Taconic or from another trail following the Connecticut-Massachusetts state line on the east, a route that allows them to visit both the tristate marker and the highest point in Connecticut, near the summit of Mount Frissell, along the way. Brace's bald summit, marked by a large cairn, offers views in all directions, particularly to the Hudson Valley and Catskills to the west. It has become a popular site for launching hang gliders and paragliders."

The summits are mostly wooded with northern hardwood forest species, but also support a 65-acre (260,000 m2) field of wild azaleas. A microwave tower stands on the east peak. A park loop automobile road and a campground, maintained for summer use, are located just to the north of the summits. Berry Pond, 2,150 feet (660 m), presumed the highest natural pond in the state of Massachusetts, is located on the ridge between Berry Mountain and Berry Hill to the north. The west side and summits of Berry Mountain are located within Hancock, Massachusetts; the east slopes are located within Pittsfield. The ridgeline continues south from Berry Mountain as Pine Mountain and Tower Mountain; it continues north as Berry Hill. Berry Mountain is bordered by West Hill to the west across the Wyomanock Creek valley. The west side of the mountain drains into Berry Pond Creek, then Wyomanock Creek, thence into Kinderhook Creek, the Hudson River and Long Island Sound. The east side drains into Lulu Creek and Parker Brook, thence into Onota Lake, the Housatonic River, and Long Island Sound."

  "text" : "Berry Hill, 2,200 feet (670 m), is a prominent mountain in the Taconic Mountains of western Massachusetts. The mountain is located in Pittsfield State Forest and is traversed by a short spur trail from a park automobile road. The Taconic Crest hiking trail and the multi-use Taconic Skyline Trail are located nearby. The mountain is known for its wild azalea fields. Its slopes are wooded with northern hardwood forest species. A park loop automobile road nearly encircles the summit, and a campground, maintained for summer use, is located just to the south of the summit. Berry Pond, 2,150 feet (660 m), presumed the highest natural pond in the state of Massachusetts, is located on the ridge between Berry Hill and Berry Mountain to the south. The mountain is located within Hancock, Massachusetts. The ridgeline continues south from Berry Hill as Berry Mountain; it continues north as Honwee Mountain. Berry Hill is bordered by West Hill to the west across the Wyomanock Creek valley. The west side of the mountain drains into Berry Pond Creek, then Wyomanock Creek, thence into Kinderhook Creek, the Hudson River and Long Island Sound. The east side drains into Lulu Creek, thence into Onota Lake, the Housatonic River, and Long Island Sound."

  "text" : "Balerdi (1,195 m), also called Mallozarra, is a mountain of the Aralar massif closing the mountain range at its northern end as well as standing last in the imposing ridge-line called the Malloak (a term used by locals to refer to them, translating roughly as 'jagged ridge') looming over the valley Araitz. It lies on the border between Gipuzkoa and Navarre as most of Aralar forms the border between both Spanish provinces. Despite its descending shape from the higher mount Artubi, the summit is popular with locals and hikers for its characteristic outline of limestone walls and the tricky access to the summit at the end of a narrow rocky stretch with cliffs on either side. As a result, there have been many fatal accidents. The main access points are in the villages at the foot of the mountain, i.e. Gaintza (388 m) and Azkarate (460 m) on the Navarrese side. The trail rises west in a zigzag to the pass of Astunalde (1,203 m), the ascent being steep. It takes no more than to 2 hours on foot. Another approach starts in the Gipuzkoan town of Amezketa and leads through the highland valley of the quarries (Minak). It takes 2½ hours to reach the top of Balerdi from there and the paths are signposted clearly all along."

The first part was completed in Autumn of 1939 with money that was collected mainly by the members of the Mountaineering Club, but also other affiliated associations. Paths begin from the shelter leaving in all directions, which can offer small and easy walks of half and one hour or long and difficult walks for the fitter. Access to the refuge is from the street that goes up Parnitha to the casino “Mont Parness”, or from a marked path which begins from the car park of the cable car and via the ravine of Choynis, leading to the shelter. Also, Bathis Square buses of line 714 of OASA leave for the Casino of Parnitha. Today, the refuge is open all year round, it has organised cooking and it offers homemade food, refreshments and drinks. It provides the possibility of overnight stay, with three dormitories of 10, 20 and 30 places, three rooms with four beds, and one room in the loft of the shelter with two beds. During the winter there is central heating."

The mountain stretches out in a north-east to south-west disposition, starting at the pass of Azkorte (hermitage) on to a quarry at the southern end, by the neighbourhood Buruntza in Andoain. The mountain rises opposite to Adarra (E) and stands in turn to the east of the mountain Andatza (562 m). There is a big cross fixed at the summit. The Oria River flows north along Buruntza's north-west face over a close valley run by the N-1 E-5 E-80 main road on both banks of the river. Actually, this tract was a race-car circuit between 1923 and 1935, its sinuous layout bearing witness to that origin. On the south-eastern side (Urnieta, Andoain), the outer reaches of the Urumea valley extend out south-east as a corridor, leaving the prominence of Buruntza towering right in the middle as a perfect vantage point over all the surroundings."

  "text" : "Brukkaros Mountain is an extinct volcano in ǁKaras Region, Namibia. Measuring 1,590 metres at its peak, Brukkaros is located about 15 kilometres northeast of the primarily Nama town of Berseba. It is over 600 metres taller than the surrounding area. The mountain is a large extinct volcano, in the form of a ring mountain (a so-called tuff ring) with a diameter of about 4 km and has been formed by an explosion when rising magma met groundwater and superheated it. It is formed of an indistinctly bedded red-brown microbreccia, composed of finely fragmented rocks of the Nama System that were blown out of a volcanic vent about 80 million years ago. The breccia layers slope inwards (unlike the slope around a volcanic crater), and removal of the softer upper layers by erosion has created the central hollow. The hollow is drained by a stream which runs southwards through the ring mountain in a narrow valley. The route into the interior of the mountain is along this valley. At its head is a dry waterfall, over which the stream plunges down some 45 m after rain, and the river bed directly below the fall is the principal source of water."

The mountain is a solid rock and is one of the most famous mountains in the Caucasus, known for its mythical stories. It is a sacred place for regular visitation by pilgrims. Tide marks on the mount attest to meltwater inundation from the northern glacial ice caps and date back to the end of the last ice age. The tidelines confirm the theory of a Holocene outflow of meltwater from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, rather than a direct incursion of sea water into the Black Sea as a result of global sea level rise. Estimates of the increase in Caspian Sea level height are between + 20 and 30 meters."

It stands above and to the west of the village of Cofton Hackett, and is part of the Lickey Hills Country Park. The three hilltops comprising The Lickeys - Bilberry Hill, Rednal Hill and Cofton Hill - form the northern extremity of the Lickey Ridge, a formation of hard quartzite. Views over Birmingham and the surrounding countryside can be seen from the top of these hills. The hill is named after the tracts of Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) bushes that cover the hill, between the pathways. Local people have been cropping the bushes of their fruit each autumn for hundreds of years to make jams, preserves or apple and bilberry pies."

Its height is 2,884 m which ranks it on third place in Pirin after Vihren and Kutelo. To the south-east of Banski Suhodol on the main ridge is located Kutelo peak and the two peaks are linked by the Koncheto ridge — a dizzy karst ridge which on some places is only 70 cm wide. On the main ridge to the north-west is situated a nameless peak from which to the north-east deviated the secondary karst ridge Koteshki Chal. From there the main ridge runs in west-northwest direction to the nearby Bayuvi Dupki peak. The north-eastern slope of Banski Suhodol is a vertical 300-meter marble wall that lowers down to the cirque of the same name. There are a lot of places in the cirque where the snow remains the whole year, several karst caves have been discovered there. The south-western slope drops down to the valley of the Vlahina river at 70°. Although that slope is not so steep as the north-eastern one, the displacement between the peak and the valley below is around 1,000 m and forms a dramatic view. In that direction there is a view to the main summit Vihren and the second in rank — Kutelo, the granite Hvoinati Vrah and Muratov Vrah as well as the secondary Sinanishki ridge with its cirques and ridges and the Vlahini Lakes with the marble peak Sinanitsa in the distance."

  "text" : "Big Schloss is a peak in the Great North Mountain range of the Ridge and Valley Appalachians, with an elevation of 2,964 feet (903 m). The peak is located in George Washington National Forest on the border of Virginia and West Virginia, though according to Topozone, the actual summit is in Virginia. The trail is part of the Lee Ranger District. It features a rocky outcropping of white sandstone with expansive views into Trout Run Valley in West Virginia and Little Schloss Mountain in Virginia. German settlers gave Big Schloss its name. Schloss means castle in German, and it is reference to the rocky outcrop. German was the common language in the area for several years. A number of hiking trails lead to Big Schloss. Hikers may ascend from Wolf Gap via the Mill Mountain trail, or a circuit hike coming from FDR Rt. 92. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club maintains the trails leading up to Big Schloss. A bridge provides access to the Big Schloss rock outcropping. In the Fall of 2010, the bridge was replaced with new stairs, 20' of new handrails, and two new concrete abutments."

Located approximately midway between the towns of Lillooet (NE) and Pemberton-Mount Currie, the mountain's very high prominence separates it from the adjoining Cadwallader Range by the pass between Blackwater Creek and Birkenhead Lake. The mountain was named by Hudson's Bay Company explorer and trader A.C. Anderson on an exploration of the route in 1842 in honour of the crew of HMS Birkenhead; nearby Seton Lake was named in honour of one of its crew who was his school-friend. The community of Birken is located at its southwest foot, Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park and the lake of the same name are on its northwest. It is framed on its north side by Blackwater Creek, a tributary of the Gates River, and on its southwest by the valley of the Birkenhead River."

  "text" : "The  is a prominent hill in Stuttgart, Germany. At an elevation of 511m, it is the highest point in the city centre of Stuttgart and is almost 300m higher than the river Neckar on which the city lies. It is in part a Schuttberg, an artificial hill built from the ruins and rubble from World War II. During the war, 53 Allied bombing missions destroyed over 45% of Stuttgart, and nearly the entire city center. Between 1953 and 1957, 1.5 million cubic meters of rubble were cleared and moved to the hill, which resulted in an increase in height of around 40 meters. At the summit there are many recognizable facades from ruined buildings. The locals colloquially call the Birkenkopf \"Monte Scherbelino\", which roughly translates as \"Mount Shards\" but in an expression alluding to Italian. One of the pieces of rubble has a plaque attached to it, which says: Dieser Berg nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg aufgetürmt aus den Trümmern der Stadt steht den Opfern zum Gedächtnis den Lebenden zur Mahnung. This translates roughly as: This mountain piled up after World War II from the rubble of the city stands as a memorial to the victims and a warning to the living. From the summit the whole city center can be seen, and on a clear day the view extends to the Swabian Alb, to the Black Forest, and the lowlands of Württemberg. On the summit there is a steel cross, which in 2003 replaced the original 1953 wooden cross. In the summer, early morning services are held on Sundays here."

The volcano lies in Tawau Division, Sabah, Malaysia across Cowie Harbour from the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan, and is the only volcano in the country. The low volcanic cone is located north of Sebatik Island and has a roughly 300-m-wide crater breached to the south. Two young lava flows extend almost to the coastal plain. The flows were considered younger than a lava flow radiocarbon dated at about 27,000 years before present, and the extrusion of basaltic lavas possibly continued into Holocene time. This marks the only known area of possible Holocene volcanism on Borneo. It is also known to be Malaysia's highest volcanic point."

The lower slopes are steep on all sides, but the extensive heath around the summit is relatively flat. Although access from the north is obstructed by an RSPB sanctuary, the summit is easily accessible from its south side, where tracks and paths lead through the forest and up onto the summit heath. From the summit, there is a small path used by locals from Ballingry, known as \"the fire escape.\" It is covered in fallen trees and slippery mud and is very dangerous. There are views across Loch Leven to the Lomond Hills, and across the Firth of Forth to the Lammermuir Hills and Pentland Hills. Distant views to the north and west are dominated by the Southern Highlands; on a clear day the profile of the Isle of Arran may be visible 80 miles to the west."

Parking is available on Mountain Road approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) north of Willimantic. The well-marked, well-maintained trail passes to the south and east of Midday Pond ascending the west side of the mountain. Directly to the south of Midday pond on the trail is a small one-room cabin with a museum open from Memorial Day to Columbus Day. The distance from parking to the summit is about 3 mi (4.8 km). The last part of the trail is very steep with sharp rocks with iron rungs to assist hikers. The East Peak offers a spectacular 360-degree view extending from the Penobscot River to the east, to the western Maine mountains and the Quebec border to the west."

It rises just west of the village of Craswall, near the border with Wales. The southern part of the ridge leading to the summit is a rocky knife-edge giving excellent views to either side. The northern part crosses a peat bog on gently sloping land at the edge of the east facing escarpment. The lower part is very similar to the main ridge of the Skirrid mountain near Abergavenny, owing to their similar underlying geology. The Black Hill is known locally as the 'Cat's Back,' as viewed from Herefordshire it looks like a crouching cat about to pounce."

In the mountain foothills, there is water catchment Garaši, which provides Aranđelovac and nearby communities with fresh water. The name of the mountain originates from the Serbian name for beech (bukva). Its slopes and its top are covered with dense woods of beech-trees. There are good paths and a paved road leading to the top. On the top there are a hunter's hostel, and many mountaineers and hunters visit them not only from Aranđelovac and its surroundings, but also from Belgrade and from other towns and villages of Serbia. Bukulja is also known for the source of the mineral water Knjaz Miloš. Its source is 500 meters deep and it is situated in extremely pure and ecological area, protected by layers of clay and granite of Bukulja mountain."

  "text" : "Bandarpunch is a mountain massif of the Garhwal division of the Himalayas, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Widely known as Bandarpoonch, which literally means \"Tail of the monkey\". This is a reference to Hanuman, the monkey god and mighty warrior, who went to its summit to extinguish his tail when it caught fire in the battle alongside King Rama to rescue the Princes Sita from the evil forces of the demon Ravana in Lanka. Bandarpoonch massif has 3 peaks. To the west above Yamnotri is White Peak (6102 m). Almost 5 km east is Bandarpoonch Peak (6316 m) and about 4 km to the north-east of that is Kalanag (6387 m) lit. black serpent, commonly known as Black Peak. Bandarpunch is strategically located at the western edge of the High Himalayan Range where it turns the corner to the northwest. It is part of the Sankari Range and lies within the Govind Pashu Vihar National Park and Sanctuary. It is a major watershed for the headwaters of the Yamuna River, whose source lies above Yamnotri, on the west end of the massif below White Peak. Yamnotri is the westernmost of the four most sacred pilgrimage places (char dham) and destination for thousands of pilgrims annually. On the north side of the Bandapoonch massif, the 12 km long glacier from its flanks feeds the Ruinsar Gad which flows into the Yamuna at Seema. On the south side, the glacier at the base of Bandarpoonch peak feeds the Hanuman Ganga River which joins the Yamuna at Hanuman Chatti. Maj Gen Harold Williams led the first successful climbing expedition in 1950. The first team to summit Bandarpoonch Peak comprised legendary Mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, Sergeant Roy Greenwood and Sherpa Kin Chok Tshering."

Although this mountain lay in the British Zone after the Second World War, the US Army operated a relay station here for their radio traffic between Frankfurt and Berlin. Its red and white transmission mast is used today for mobile telephone communications. It projects above the surrounding trees and is visible from a long way off. On the summit of the Bocksberg there is a restaurant and a wooden observation tower that was built in 1976."

The region has only recently been explored and before 2009, none of its 47 peaks above 6,000 m had been climbed. Bairiga / Ruoni, which remains unclimbed itself, was photographed for the first time in 1933 by the botanist explorer Frank Kingdon-Ward, at which time it was known as Choembo. In 2009, a Sino-Japanese joint climbing team formed by China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Kobe University organized an expedition to climb Kangri Garpo II or Ruoni Ⅱ (6,805 m). On November 5, Deqing Ouzhu and Ciren Danda, Tibetan students with the CUG, were the first to reach the summit, while Koichiro Kondo and Masanori Yazaki scaled the peak two days later. In consultation with a local village leader Kangri Garpo II was renamed Lopchin (Lopchin Feng in Tibetan, Lou bu qin in Chinese), meaning \"white male hawk\"."

Barlow in 1871, Bunsen Peak was not named until 1872 during the second Hayden Geologic Survey. E. S. Topping named the peak Observation Mountain in 1872 as well, but that name did not stick. The Bunsen Peak Trail with its trailhead just south of Mammoth is a steep 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to the summit. Bunsen Peak was named for the German chemist Robert Bunsen, the inventor of the Bunsen Burner and responsible for early work on volcanic geyser theories."

  "text" : "Baner hill is a hill that separates two suburbs of Pune, Pashan and Baner. The hill is the third highest point within the city limits, with an elevation of 2224 ft., surpassed by the Vetal Hill and the Surtarwadi Hill. There is a temple located in the northern foot of the hill. The place is an excellent getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city and provides a great morning trek location for the weekends. One can view the whole of baner on one side and the pashan area from the other. The place is actually the home for a plantation drive that has been taken up enthusiastically by the locals, helped by numerous volunteers. One can see people coming up early in the morning every Sunday and working in groups to make the place greener."

  "text" : "Barronette Peak el. 10,354 feet (3,156 m) is a mountain peak in the northeast section of Yellowstone National Park in the Absaroka Range. The peak is named for Collins Jack (John H. Yellowstone Jack) Baronette (1829–1901). It was named by the Hayden Geological Survey of 1878. When named, the name was misspelled Barronette and it retains the official misspelled name today. Jack Baronette was an early Yellowstone guide and entrepreneur. He built and operated the first bridge across the Yellowstone River near the confluence of the Lamar River in 1871 to service miners traveling to Cooke City, Montana. In 1870, as a resident of Helena, Montana he participated in the search for and rescue of Truman C. Everts, lost during the Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition of 1870. In 1884, he was considered for the superintendency of Yellowstone."

  "text" : "Bear Mountain is a mountain located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, southwest of Waleska, Georgia. Situated between the northwest and west-central part of Cherokee County, Georgia, it is the highest point in the county at 2,303 feet (702 m). It is also the highest point in the extended metro Atlanta area, which lies to the south and southeast, while Lake Arrowhead lies to the east-southeast at the foot of the mountain. Just to the west runs the Bartow/Cherokee county line. For media in Atlanta, there are two broadcast stations on the mountain. The TV tower is that of 1000-kilowatt WPXA-TV 31 (14.x), also the site of its former analog TV transmission. Its city of license is Rome, Georgia, two counties to the west, but it is considered part of the Atlanta media market for purposes of must-carry regulations. Because it is so far out of town, and in a different direction for most people, reception of the station is often difficult, especially due to the digital TV format mandated by the FCC. The only other major TV station in northwest Georgia is WNGH-TV 33 (18.x), located much further north. For FM broadcasting, W213BV on 90.5 (W214AS on 90.7) was a 10-watt broadcast translator for Calvary Chapel of Twin Falls, one of hundreds relaying KAWZ, in this case licensed to serve Waleska. The tower was also the first site for WCHK-FM 105.5, originally a simulcast of WCHK AM 1290, both licensed to serve Canton, Georgia (the county seat). That station changed frequency to 105.7, and after having another tower along Interstate 575, is now WRDA to the southeast on Sweat Mountain. However, the table of allotments still lists Bear Mountain for the station's reservation."

On the hill ridge are the remains of a circular rampart, probably built by Celtic settlers. On the eastern side lies the village of Ebersteinburg. The Battert is a destination for ramblers and climbers all year round, heading for the 15–60-metre-high Battertfelsen. Above and below the rock face is a footpath around the rocks. The red rock face is visible from far off and may be easily reached on the road to the ruins of Hohenbaden or from a car park near Ebersteinburg."

The mountain forms the prominent centrepiece between the valleys of the Kinzig, the Wolf and the Harmersbach. The name of the Brandenkopf (\"Fire Peak\") is derived from a great forest fire in 1730. Before this event it was called the Varnlehenskopf. The Brandenkopf is well developed with roads and footpaths (including the Hansjakobweg II and a link to the West Way, 3.5 km away) from several directions. There is a transmitter, the Sender Brandenkopf, on the mountain."

The peaks are 2,405 feet (733 m) and 2,360 feet (719 m) high and a stream named Zipper Creek runs between them. Ice thickness studies of Taku Glacier were conducted near the hills in 1989, 1990, and 1993. Nancy Bartley of The Seattle Times attributes the naming to photographer Austin Post. The name was noted by the United States Geological Survey on 1948 and 1962 topographical maps of the Juneau area, but it was removed prior to the latter edition's publication. It later appeared on a 1997 USGS map. It was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on March 31, 1981."

  "text" : "Barnaslingan (Irish: Barr na Slinneán, meaning \"summit of the shoulder blades\") is a 238 metres (781 feet) high hill in County Dublin, Ireland. It is most noted for the geological feature known as The Scalp (Irish: An Scailp, meaning \"the chasm\" or \"cleft\") that lies to the west of the summit. Samuel Lewis, in A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), described it thus: “A deep natural chasm in the mountain, forming a defile with lofty and shelving ramparts on each side, from which large detached masses of granite many tons of weight have fallen, on each side large masses of detached rock are heaped together in wild confusion, apparently arrested in their descent, and threatening at every moment to crush the traveller by their fall”. The Scalp is a narrow glacial valley formed approximately 12,000 years ago during the last Ice Age. During this period a massive ice sheet covered the Irish Sea extending inland over the Dublin-Wicklow Mountains. As the ice melted several glacial lakes formed, including one at Enniskerry, enclosed by the mountains and the ice sheet. The pressure created by this volume of water pressing against the bedrock eventually found a weak point and gouged out the channel now known as The Scalp. The same process created similar features in nearby County Wicklow at the Glen of the Downs and at the Rocky Valley north of the Great Sugar Loaf. On account of its status as an example of a glacial lake overflow, it is listed as an Area of Scientific Interest. The steep, rocky slopes are home to a herd of feral goats and the area is also a habitat for deer and badgers. The route of the R117 road passes through The Scalp between Kilternan and Enniskerry. Even though the floor of the valley is quite narrow, a small number of buildings are situated along the roadside. The most prominent of these is the Scalp Service Station; prior to 1963 this was a ballroom called “The New Era”. Another house, now a private residence, was a tea room called “Butler's Tea House”. Overlooking the area is the Kilternan Golf and Country Club which first opened as a hotel in 1970. It is built around a nineteenth-century house called Springfield which was once the home of the poet and mathematician George Darley (1795-1846). In 2001 the hotel was purchased by the hotelier and developer Hugh O'Regan who commenced a major redevelopment and expansion of the property. Although the work is 90 percent complete, Mr O'Regan's companies went into liquidation in 2009 and its future is uncertain. The land around the hotel is also the site of a dry ski slope and headquarters of the Ski Club of Ireland; it continues to operate. Barnaslingan lies within a Coillte-owned forest recreation area which is managed by the Dublin Mountains Partnership. There are a number of waymarked walking trails in the woods as well as a permanent orienteering course. Barnaslingan is also traversed by the Dublin Mountains Way."

From the summit, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham are all visible, as is the Staffordshire, Shropshire and Welsh countryside to the west. The hill is so named as historically it was one in a series of prominent locations with beacons on top, where a fire would be lit as a signal during times of war or turmoil. The Sedgley beacon lies between beacons at Barr Beacon and Cannock Chase. At the highest point, a Grade II listed tower erected in 1846 by Lord Wrottesley for astronomy, stands on the site of an earlier tower, which sits on the spot of the original beacon. Beacon Hill is the highest point of land between Sedgley and the Ural Mountains in Russia. When the tower was climbable (today a fence restricts access as the steps inside were removed by the council to prevent access), the Bristol Channel was visible on a clear day. Approximately half of Beacon Hill was situated in the urban district of Coseley, which was created in 1897 from the eastern half of the old Sedgley manor. This section included the Beacon Tower. However, the local government reorganisation of 1966 (which saw the bulk of Sedgley and approximately half of Coseley incorporated into Dudley) resulted in the creation of post code districts, with all of Beacon Hill being included in the new Sedgley DY3 post code district."

The well known Norwegian Soccer trainer Drillo, also known for his interest in geography, told a local resident, Frank Angelvik, that the highest point of Frøya was unnamed. Together with Halgeir Hammer, a local guide, the naming contest was announced in September 2009. Some of the runner-up names were: Frøyberget, Frøytuva, Halgeirtoppen, Halgeirguten og Besselberget."

At the foot of the hill are two villages East Brent and Brent Knoll, which takes its name from the hill but was previously called South Brent. The hill's size and isolated position on the levels mean that it dominates the landscape and can be seen for many miles, and its prominence is emphasised to travellers because the Bristol to Taunton railway line, M5 motorway, A370 and A38 roads all pass within a mile or less from its base."

At its foot lies Browngelly Downs, and the area has preserved various remains of hut circles, barrows and cairns. Five cairns are located in a semi-circular arc along the ridge of Brown Gelly. They are prominent from a distance and Christopher Tilley suggests they were intended to be seen as a group from the west and the east in order to \"analogically resemble or simulate tors\". The tor is made of a granitic rock that has less autogenic alteration than other areas of Bodmin Moor due to some type of local anomaly. Archaeological aerial reconnaissance was carried out over the area in the 1980s which suggested the remains of a prehistoric settlement comprising several dispersed hut circles. These structures have also been called a \"barrow group\" by John Barnatt Evidence of flint production and tin streaming has also been found in the area that supports the suggestion of an ancient settlement."

There are three summits in the group, ranging from 2,306 m (7,566 ft) to 2,369 m (7,772 ft). Battle Mountain is accessible by a combination of road and trail. It is a popular summer tourist attraction and is especially noted for colourful alpine meadows. The access trail is longer and more strenuous than the one to nearby Trophy Mountain to the south, so fewer people visit Battle Mountain and the Caribou Meadows. The hike to the meadows can be accomplished as a day outing, but hikers who want to attain Fiftytwo Ridge and Battle Mountain summit should plan for two days and carry overnight equipment."

  "text" : "Beaucatcher Mountain is located in a portion of the Appalachian Mountain Range known as the Great Craggy Mountains, in Asheville, North Carolina. Its name was said to have been coined by James W. Patton, who once teased his sister-in-law, Charlotte Kerry, after watching her stroll the mountainside with her \"beau\". Patton suggested her eagerness to walk the mountain was incentive for her beau to spend time with her, thus, the mountain was dubbed Charlotte’s “beau catcher.” Beaucatcher Mountain's elevation reaches 2,694 feet (821 m), providing views of Downtown Asheville. The mountain borders the eastern part of downtown Asheville and has three main roads that tunnel through and go over the mountain. They are: US 70/US 74A via Beaucatcher Tunnel (completed in 1927), I-240 via Beaucatcher Cut (completed in 1980), and a Town Mountain Road (NC 694) which leads towards the Blue Ridge Parkway. Beaucatcher Mountain originally had two reservoirs: White Fawn Reservoir (long ago decommissioned and filled in with construction debris) and Lake Kenilworth. The reservoirs provided drinking water to the city of Asheville beginning in the 1880s. Waters from the mountain eventually make their way to the French Broad River."

The Buchberg is cloaked by a forest, 23 hectares in area, which is one of the few near-natural stands of deciduous forest in the Fichtel Mountains (woodrush beech forest). As a result, the area has been a protected natural monument since 1938 and is also a designated Natura 2000 region. On the north side of the granite rock face is a memorial tablet to Arthur Münch, who held the post of gamekeeper and forest manager for decades."

  "text" : "Black Mountain, is a ridge in the Diablo Range of southwestern Fresno County, California, south of Reef Ridge. Its east end begins about 1.25 miles west of Zwang Peak, and runs at elevations over 4000 feet, with the mid ridge rising to 4345 feet, westerly about 3.25 miles to Castle Mountain at an elevation of 4343 feet. It then turns west northwest 2 miles at elevations above 3790 feet with several peaks over 3800 feet and one over 3900 feet along the length of it. There it is linked to the next east west mountain ridge extending east from Mustang Peak. The high point of the ridge is 7.7 miles (12.4 km) north northeast of Parkfield, California. The crest of the Black Mountain Ridge from Castle Mountain to the Mustang Peak ridge and extending west along that ridge is the boundary line between Fresno County and Monterey County and the watershed of the San Joaquin Valley. The far eastern end of the north slope of the Black Mountain ridge is the source of Canoas Creek."

It is located 51 km (32 mi) west of Bralorne on the northeastern flank of the Mount Meager massif. With an elevation of 1,524 m (5,000 ft), it lies on the steep northern face of Plinth Peak, a 2,677 m (8,783 ft) high volcanic peak comprising the northern portion of Meager. The vent rises above the western shoulder of the Pemberton Valley and represents the northernmost volcanic feature of the Mount Meager massif. At least eight volcanic vents compose the Meager massif, with the Bridge River Vent being the most recent to form. It is the only vent of the massif to exhibit volcanic activity in the past 10,000 years and one of the several vents in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt to erupt since the end of the last glacial period. The crater constitutes a bowl-shaped depression overlain by glacial ice and volcanic debris that were deposited during volcanic activity. Its breached northern rim has been a pathway for lava and ash flows that have traveled throughout the nearby Pemberton Valley."

The county boundary with Wiltshire runs past the summit some 200 metres to the northeast on the upper slopes of Charlton Down. The terrain drops steeply on three sides; the ridge on the fourth side running away to the southeast and east in a gently curve towards Win Green hill, the highest point on Cranborne Chase. On the steep western scarp is Zig Zag Hill with the hairpin bends of the B3081. Near the hill is evidence of prehistoric activity in the form of tumuli, long barrows, earthworks and cross dykes. About a mile and a half away to the west-southwest is another prominent summit, Melbury Beacon"

The Big Lava Bed is the youngest feature of the Indian Heaven volcanic field. The 0.9-cubic kilometer lava flow erupted from the cinder cone about 8200 years ago. The lava flow traveled 13 km from the source crater. Lodgepole pine, alder, and other pioneer plants struggle to grow, seen sparsely growing between and amid towering rock piles, caves, and strange lava formations. Access into the interior of the lava bed is difficult, since there are no roads or trails crossing the lava field. Explorers who wish to venture deep within the lava flow are advised to choose their route carefully. Compasses are not always reliable, since local magnetic influences affect their magnetic performance in the vast expanse of rock."

  "text" : "Blackdown Hill is a prominent elevation, 215 metres (705 ft) high, 5 miles (8.0 km) south west of the town of Crewkerne, in the county of Dorset in the south west of England. Its prominence of 34 metres (112 ft) means it is listed as one of the Tumps. It runs parallel to the B3165 towering over the hamlets of Kittwhistle and Blackdown at the foot of the eastern flanks of the ridge. The open summit of the hill lies at the northern end of a mile-long north-south ridge. The Jubilee Trail runs along the ridge line initially before dropping just below it to the west and then descending steeply down Venn Hill, a northwestern spur of Blackdown, towards the village of Thorncombe on the far side of the River Synderford that runs past the foot of Blackdown Hill to the west. Pilsdon Pen (277 m), formerly thought to be Dorset's highest point, lies about 2 miles (3.2 km) to the south east. To the east is the Temple Brook which rises north of the col between Blackdown and Pilsdon Pen."

It is bounded to the west by B3143, and on the other three sides by a minor road passing through the hamlets of Rew, Sharnhill Green and Bookham, after which it is named. To the east, beyond the lane, a tributary of the River Lydden rises below the col separating the knoll from Church Hill, the western spur of Ball Hill.

Bote Mountain is located in the Great Smoky Mountains, which began forming in the late Carboniferous and through the early Triassic, approximately 310 to 245 million years ago. The oldest rocks of the Great Smoky Mountains, however, date from the Neoproterozoic, approximately 800 million years ago. Those rocks are sedimentary rocks, and were deposited on an ancient ocean floor on the edge of a supercontinent. Bote Mountain was named because of a misunderstanding when, in the 1830s, Cherokee workers were asked which route a new road would follow. They pointed towards Bote Mountain and said \"vote\", which was interpreted by the white workers, who thought they were naming the mountain, as \"bote\". Hence, the mountain was named \"Bote Mountain\". The Bote Mountain Trail follows the crest of the mountain, and intersects the Appalachian Trail at Spence Field."

The hill is located entirely within the territory of the municipality of Bobenthal, from which it derives its name. It lies about two kilometres east of the main settlement. In the west it descends relatively gently to the valley of the Wieslauter stream; in the east it drops considerably more steeply into the valley of the Reisbach. The Bobenthaler Kopf is covered by mixed woods. A footpath leads to the summit from the south. It forms the centre of the 319 hectare Bobenthaler Knopf Core Zone in the Palatine Forest Nature Park. About 1.5 kilometres to the south lie the Rittersteins of Löffelkreuz and Eselsschleifhäuschen."

It is on the San Xavier Indian Reservation, 3.18 miles southwest of the Mission San Xavier del Bac. The Sierrita Mountains rise to the southwest and the Santa Cruz River is about four miles to the east. On top of Black Mountain are the ruins of an ancient Hohokam fortification. Long stone walls, circular stone rings, petroglyphs, man-made trails, and pottery sherds can still be seen today. However, the site is on reservation land, and is therefore not open to the general public."

The old Reichsstraße 93 from Leipzig, which makes its way over the Hirschenstander Pass to Karlsbad, runs past the foot of the Buchkamm by the Nasse Bridge. Today it is only used as a forest road. Until the 1990s there was also a royal Saxon milestone here. An old smuggler's path, the Butter Way (Butterweg), runs past the Buchkamm to the southeast. It was used to smuggle butter and other goods between Bohemia and Saxony. It is now a hiking trail. The Große Bockau rises not far south of the Buchkamm on the Czech border. In 1839 there was a mine, the Pfingstfest in operation on the Buchkamm."

Unlike many other lunar features named by the Apollo astronauts, the name of the mountain is not formally recognized by the International Astronomical Union.

An exposed area on the south west of the mountain shows where the Eocene aplitic granite meets the laccolith top of the older Mesozoic granite ring dike. The summit of the mountain features granite crags which are crossed by basic and feldspar porphyry dikes. The mountain is used for sheep grazing and hill walking. \n* View of Ben Crom (center), Silent Valley Reservoir (bottom) and Ben Crom Reservoir (top right) from Slievenaglogh.

Only towards the south does it transition into a shallow saddle (1,452.8 m) that links the Baldenweger Buck with the Feldberg top. With its low isolation of 520 metres and a prominence of only 7.7 metres to the Feldberg, the Baldenweger Buck is not considered to be an independent eminence, but a subpeak of the Feldberg. As a result, the second highest summit in the Black Forest is usually seen as the lower, but more prominent, Seebuck. A waymarked footpath runs over the Baldenweger Buck from the Rinken via the Baldenweger Hut to the summit of the Feldberg."
