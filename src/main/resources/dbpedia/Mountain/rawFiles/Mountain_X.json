  "text" : "Xueshan or Hsuehshan (Chinese: 雪山; pinyin: Xuě Shān; literally: \"Snow Mountain\") a mountain in Heping District, Taichung, Taiwan. It is the second highest mountain in Taiwan and in East Asia, at 3,886 m (12,749 ft) above sea level. It is located in the Shei-Pa National Park and it is visible in good weather from hills near Taiwan's capital Taipei. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was known to Westerners as Mt. Sylvia. In 1923 (see Taiwan under Japanese rule), the mountain gained the name Tsugitakayama (次高山), literally the \"Second Highest Mountain\", because in the Japanese Empire at that time, only Yushan (also on Taiwan) was higher. They are both ahead of Mt. Fuji in terms of height. It was designated part of the Tsugitaka-Taroko National Park by the Governor-General of Taiwan on December 12, 1937."

  "text" : "Xuelian Feng, Xuelian Peak or Snow Lotus Peak(Chinese: 雪莲峰), is one of the major mountains of the Tian Shan mountain range. It lies in Xinjiang province, China, about 50 kilometres (30 mi) east-northeast of Jengish Chokusu, the highest peak in the range. It is notable for its large, steep relief above the nearby valleys, and for its large topographic prominence. (It is ranked 84th in the world by this measure). The peak has two summits, with the main being the north summit at 6,627 m (21,742 ft); the south summit has an elevation of 6,527 m (21,414 ft). The Tokai Section of the Japanese Alpine Club made four expeditions to Xuelian Feng, in 1986, 1988, 1989, and 1990, with the last being successful in ascending the main summit. (The 1989 expedition ascended the south summit and \"Junction Peak\", another subpeak to the south of the main summit, with elevation 6,450 m (21,161 ft), and came close to but did not reach the main summit.) In 1990, the expedition was led by Kazuo Tukushima, and ascended from the Karakume Glacier. The route ascended the southeast ridge of Junction Peak, then traversed a long (2 km/1.2 mi) corniced snow and rock ridge to reach the main summit tower. Other difficulties involved in the 2,500 m (8,200 ft) route included technical rock and ice walls, and snow gullies up to 70 degrees in steepness."
