  "text" : "Snowdon (Welsh: Yr Wyddfa, pronounced [ər ˈwɪðva]) is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of 1,085 metres (3,560 ft) above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles outside the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) in Gwynedd, and has been described as \"probably the busiest mountain in Britain\". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna. The rocks that form Snowdon were produced by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif has been extensively sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest. The summit can be reached by a number of well-known paths, and by the Snowdon Mountain Railway, a rack and pinion railway opened in 1896 which carries passengers the 4.7 miles (7.6 km) from Llanberis to the summit station. The summit also houses a cafe called Hafod Eryri, open only when the railway is operating and built in 2006 to replace one built in the 1930s. The railway generally operates to the summit station from Whitsun to October. The daily running schedule depends on weather and customer demand. The name Snowdon is from the Old English for \"snow hill\", while the Welsh name – Yr Wyddfa – means \"the tumulus\" or \"the barrow\", which may refer to the cairn thrown over the legendary giant Rhitta Gawr after his defeat by King Arthur. As well as other figures from Arthurian legend, the mountain is linked to a legendary afanc (water monster) and the Tylwyth Teg (fairies)."

It is named the Santner Spitze in his honour. The Schlern dominates the villages of Seis am Schlern and Völs am Schlern, and the summit can be reached following the circular route marked with the number 1 from both villages. At 1,700 metres (5,577 ft), there is the Schlernboden inn and on the summit plateau is the Schlernhaus inn 2,457 metres (8,061 ft), both open from 1 June to 15 October. The highest summit is the Petz with 2,564 metres (8,412 ft). The Schlern is sung of in the Bozner Bergsteigerlied as one of South Tyrol's landmarks. Its characteristic profile appears on the Der Schlern - Zeitschrift für Südtiroler Landeskunde (Magazine for South Tyrolean Regional Studies) and the logo pressed into Loacker's wafer biscuits."

  "text" : "Schonchin Butte is a cinder cone on the northern flank of Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range in northern California. Frothy lava, cooled in the air, created the large cinder cones throughout Lava Beds National Monument. It is named for Old Schonchin, a chief of the Modoc people during the late nineteenth century. Erupting more than 30,000 years ago, the volcano spewed ash and cinders into the air much like a can of soda when shaken. A lava spatter rampart is at the very top. The butte's three quarter mile long trail leads to a panoramic view from the historic fire lookout. From the lookout panoramic views of the Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, Mount McLoughlin, the Clear Lake Hills and the Warner Mountains can be seen. On a really clear day, the south rim of Crater Lake in Oregon is visible."

At its summit, the elevation is 1,686 feet (514 m) MSL and 825 feet (251 m) above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well-known not only for its geology, but also for the enormous rock relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief in the world. The carving depicts three Confederate figures during the Civil War: Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis. Stone Mountain was once owned by the Venable Brothers and was the site of the founding of the second Ku Klux Klan in 1915. It was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958. Stone Mountain is more than 5 miles (8 km) in circumference at its base. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride aerial tram."

  "text" : "Solfatara is a shallow volcanic crater at Pozzuoli, near Naples, part of the Campi Flegrei volcanic area. It is a dormant volcano, which still emits jets of steam with sulfurous fumes. The name comes from the Latin, Sulpha terra, \"land of sulfur\", or \"sulfur earth\". It was formed around 4000 years ago and last erupted in 1198 with what was probably a phreatic eruption - an explosive steam-driven eruption caused when groundwater interacts with magma. The crater floor is a popular tourist attraction, as it has many fumaroles and mud pools. The area is well known for its bradyseism. The vapours have been used for medical purposes since Roman times. \n* Panoramic view of the crater towards South East \n* Close-up view of a mud pool \n* Medium size fumarole in Solfatara \n* Biggest fumarole in Solfatara This volcano is where the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus was first isolated. The archaeon is named for the volcano, as most species of the genus Sulfolobus are named for the area where they are first isolated. In 305, this is the location where the patron of Pozzuoli, Saint Proculus, and the patron of Naples, Saint Januarius were beheaded."

  "text" : "Seoraksan is the highest mountain in the Taebaek mountain range in the Gangwon Province in eastern South Korea. It is located in a national park near the city of Sokcho. After the Hallasan volcano on Jeju Island and Jirisan in the south, Seoraksan is the third highest mountain in South Korea. The Daechongbong Peak (대청봉) of Seoraksan reaches 1,708 meters (5,603 feet). The Taebaek mountain chain is often considered the backbone of the Korean peninsula. The national park attracts many national and international tourists all year round, but the main season for Seoraksan national park is autumn. The autumn colours in the area are considered amongst the most beautiful in Korea. The red and yellow forest is interrupted by rocks and small mountain streams flow amidst this. During the rainy season in summer—especially after a typhoon—these streams can swell. Perhaps the most visited part of the mountain is the main entrance valley to the National Park, a fifteen-minute drive from Sokcho city. The valley runs west to east with a paved road leading up to the park's entrance gate. This valley contains many beautiful sites and is well worth a day visit. The Yukdam waterfall and the Biryeong waterfall (비룡폭포) are located on the left side of the valley, about a forty-minute walk from the main car park.Ulsanbawi (울산바위) is a rock formation in the Seoraksan national park. The shape of Ulsanbawi is unique in the area. To reach the rocks you need to follow a hiking path and climb over 800 steps (it is actually 888 steps according to locals). On the way there, there are two temples and a spherical rock (Heundeulbawi, 흔들바위) which is located on top of a larger rock. This rock is about 5 meters (16 feet) high and can be moved with some effort. Thousands of people have already tried to push down Heundeulbawi, but nobody gets further than waggling the rock. According to the legend Ulsanbawi comes from the city of Ulsan in the south east of Korea. As Kumgangsan (금강산) was built, Ulsanbawi walked to the north as the representative of the city. Unfortunately Ulsanbawi arrived too late and there was no more room. Ulsanbawi was ashamed and slowly trudged back to the south. One evening the rock went to sleep in the Seorak area. Ulsanbawi felt it was so beautiful around there that it decided to stay for good. At the end of the main valley is Biseondae, a rock platform in a stream. Above the stream is a difficult to reach cave, which offers clear views of the surrounding rock formations. A bit farther from the entrance is the Valley of a Thousand Buddhas (천불동계곡), the primary valley of Seorak Mountain, also sometimes referred to as Seorak Valley. The valley was so named because the rock formations that line its sides resemble a line-up of Buddha statues."

  "text" : "Superstition Mountain (Yavapai: Wi:kchsawa, O'odham: Gakoḍk) is located immediately east of the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona. It anchors the west end of the Superstition Wilderness. Although its precise origin is debated by geologists, many believe that the mountain was formed from volcanic activity as far back as 25 million years ago. The ash and basalt composed mountain was eroded by the elements to give it the unique form it has today, creating the prominent landmark and popular recreation destination in the region. The mountain, located near Apache Junction and Gold Canyon, Arizona, is easily accessible from U.S. Route 60 and State Route 88. It is a popular three season (fall, winter, spring) hiking area. Afternoon temperatures from June to September are usually in the range of 100 to 115 °F near the mountain. Day hikers often frequent the mountain during cooler months. The Lost Dutchman State Park is located on the western side of the mountain and includes hiking trails to notable formations such as the Praying Hands and the Flatiron. The Peralta Trail, on the southern side of the mountain, traverses Fremont Saddle and descends into the wilderness to the east of the mountain."

  "text" : "Stanage Edge, or simply Stanage (from \"stone edge\") is a gritstone escarpment in the Peak District, England, famous as a location for climbing. The northern part of the edge forms the border between the High Peak of Derbyshire and Sheffield in South Yorkshire. Its highest point is High Neb at 458 metres (1,503 ft) above sea level. Areas of Stanage were quarried in the past to produce grindstones, and some can still be seen on the hillside—carved, but never removed. A paved packhorse road ran along the top of the edge, and remains of it can be seen, as can remains of the Long Causeway Roman road which works its way over the edge on its route from Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe, crossing Hallam Moor and passing Stanedge Pole (note the slightly different spelling), an ancient waymarker on the route to Sheffield. Some cairns along the top are even older, and there is a well-known cave in the cliff known as Robin Hood's Cave. More recent features include early 20th-century drinking basins, designed to collect pure rainwater for grouse to drink. Stanage is a magnet for climbers and ramblers in addition to runners. The Stanage Struggle is a popular local fell race that starts in nearby Hathersage and rises to High Neb before returning to the village 500 feet below."

Most distinctly in the view from the cliffs at Squaw Bay the Giant appears to have an \"Adam's Apple\". The formation is part of Sleeping Giant Provincial Park. Its dramatic steep cliffs are among the highest in Ontario (250 m). The southernmost point is known as Thunder Cape, depicted by many early Canadian artists such as William Armstrong.

The Giant is known for its expansive clifftop vistas, rugged topography, and microclimate ecosystems. Most of the Giant is located within Sleeping Giant State Park. The mountain is a popular recreation resource; over 30 miles (48 km) of hiking trails traverse it including 5 miles (8 km) of the 23-mile (37 km) Quinnipiac Trail.

  "text" : "Signal de Botrange (German [outdated] Baldringen, Latin Sicco Campo) is the highest point in Belgium, located in the High Fens (Hautes Fagnes in French, Hoge Venen in Dutch, Hohes Venn in German), at 694 metres (2,277 ft). It is the top of a broad plateau and a road crosses the summit, passing an adjacent café. In 1923, the 6 m Baltia tower was built on the summit to allow visitors to reach an altitude of 700 m. A stone tower built in 1934 reaches 718 m. For several decades a meteorological station was installed at signal Botrange. Since 1999, it was replaced by an automatic station of the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium installed on Mount Rigi (scientific station of the High Fens - University of Liege), which is between the signal and the house Botrange Michel. Signal de Botrange experiences stronger winds than the centre of Belgium. Average and extreme temperatures are usually lower than at any other place in Belgium: the minimum temperature recorded (-25.6 °C) does not, however, exceed the absolute record (-30.1 °C), observed in the valley of the Lomme, at Rochefort during a temperature inversion. In winter, for three months, on average, the average temperature remains below 0 °C. Rainfall is much greater than most of the rest of the country, at an annual average of 1450 mm compared with 800 mm in Uccle. Rainfall is also much more common: there are over 200 days of precipitation per year (against just over 170 in Uccle). Maximum temperatures in summer rarely exceed 30 °C. The number of days of frost is over 130 days per year and the number of days of snowfall exceeds 35 days. The maximum thickness of snow was measured on 9 February 1953, at 115 cm of snow. Frost and early snowfall can occur in late September, but that is exceptional. Late snow may sometimes occur until mid-May. At the height of winter the site is used as the start of a number of cross-country skiing routes."

It is ranked sixth among peaks in the 48 contiguous states. According to John W. Robinson and Bruce D. Risher, authors of The San Jacintos, \"No Southern California hiker worth his salt would miss climbing 'San Jack' at least once.\" Known for its spectacular north escarpment, the peak rises 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above San Gorgonio Pass. It plays host to the famous Cactus to Clouds Trail."

  "text" : "Skiddaw is a mountain in the Lake District National Park in England, where its 931-metre (3,054 ft) summit is the sixth-highest in England. It lies just north of the town of Keswick, Cumbria, and dominates the skyline in this part of the northern lakes. It is the simplest of the Lake District mountains of this height to ascend (as there is a well-trodden tourist track from a car park to the north-east of Keswick, near the summit of Latrigg) and, as such, many walking guides recommend it to the occasional walker wishing to climb a mountain. This is the first summit of the fell running challenge known as the Bob Graham Round when undertaken in a clockwise direction. The mountain lends its name to the surrounding areas of \"Skiddaw Forest\", and \"Back o' Skidda'\" and to the isolated \"Skiddaw House\", situated to the east, formerly a shooting lodge and subsequently a youth hostel. It also provides the name for the slate derived from that region: Skiddaw slate. Tuned percussion musical instruments or lithophones exist which are made from the slate, such as the Musical Stones of Skiddaw held at the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery."

  "text" : "The Schilthorn is a 2,970 metre high summit of the Bernese Alps in Switzerland. It overlooks the valley of Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Oberland, and is the highest mountain in the range lying north of the Sefinenfurgge Pass. The Schilthorn lies above the village of Mürren, from where a cable car leads to its summit. Administratively, the summit is within the municipality of Lauterbrunnen, although the western slopes are within the municipality of Reichenbach im Kandertal. Both municipalities are in the canton of Bern. The summit has a panoramic view which spans from the Titlis, Jungfrau, Mönch, Eiger, over the Bernese Alps and the Jura mountains up to the Vosges Mountains and the Black Forest. Mont Blanc is also just visible. To get to the Schilthorn from the valley floor either of a series of cable cars must be taken. The cable cars begin in Stechelberg leaving to Gimmelwald and then onto Mürren. From Mürren another cable car is taken to Birg, which is the final change before the Schilthorn. This cable airway is the longest and was the most technically challenging airway to be built. The other way up is to take the cable car from Lauterbrunnen to Grütschalp and a train to Mürren, from where the cable car must be taken. Between Birg and the summit, the cable car passes over Grauseeli, a small lake. It is also possible to hike to the peak, along the myriad of small, but well-marked paths to the top. The hike to the top takes roughly 5 hours from Gimmelwald for a fit walker. There is a panoramic revolving restaurant, named Piz Gloria, at the summit, which is where the 1969 James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service was set. A black ski run featured in the film starts at the summit and leads down to the Engetal below Birg. The restaurant revolves a full 360 degrees in 55 minutes. After considering a number of locations, the stalled construction of the sports bar atop the Schilthorn was chosen when the film's producer financed the completion of the famous revolving platform for the right to use the facility for his next film, the first and only Bond film starring George Lazenby. A number of scenes in the film were photographed by cameraman John Jordan hanging below a speeding helicopter. Jordan had previously lost a foot to a helicopter rotor while filming the movie You Only Live Twice. Within a year and fitted with a prosthetic limb, Jordan lost his footing and fell 2,000 feet to his death when filming similar aerial imagery used in the film Catch-22. During the winter the Schilthorn is the traditional start for the world longest down hill ski race the \"Inferno\" which started in 1928. During the summer the Inferno Triathlon finishes at the summit after a run up from the Lauterbrunnen valley."

  "text" : "San Gorgonio Mountain, also known locally as Mount San Gorgonio, or Old Greyback, is the highest peak in Southern California and the Transverse Ranges at 11,503 feet (3,506 m). It is in the San Bernardino Mountains, 27 miles (43 km) east of the city of San Bernardino and 12 miles (19 km) north-northeast of San Gorgonio Pass. It lies within the San Gorgonio Wilderness, part of the Sand to Snow National Monument managed by the San Bernardino National Forest. Spanish missionaries in the area during the early 17th century named the peak after Saint Gorgonius. Since it is the highest point in a region which is separated from higher peaks (e.g. in the Sierra Nevada) by relatively low terrain, San Gorgonio Mountain is one of the most topographically prominent peaks in the United States. It is ranked 7th among peaks in the 48 contiguous states and 18th among overall. Like other high peaks in the Transverse Ranges, the mountain has a pyramid shape, with a steep north face and a slightly shallower south face. The mountain is large and broad; the summit plateau itself is one square-mile in area (2 km2). In contrast to its spectacular but lower neighbor, San Jacinto Peak, San Gorgonio is not particularly craggy, and from a distance, it only appears to be an extremely high hill, earning it the name of greyback. Despite not being particularly striking in appearance during the summer, it is the only mountain in Southern California with a summit a significant distance above the tree line. As such its bright white winter snow cap, unobstructed by vegetation, makes the mountain noticeable from many miles away. The mountain hosts the longest recorded line of sight in the contiguous United States; it is plainly visible from the summit of Mount Whitney, 190 miles away."

  "text" : "Sunset Crater is a cinder cone located north of Flagstaff in U.S. State of Arizona. The crater is within the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. Sunset Crater is the youngest in a string of volcanoes (the San Francisco volcanic field) that is related to the nearby San Francisco Peaks. The date of the eruptions that formed the 340-meter-high cone (1,120 ft) was initially derived from tree-ring dates, suggesting the eruption began between the growing seasons of A.D. 1064–1065. However, more recent geologic and archaeological evidence places the eruption around A.D. 1085. The largest vent of the eruption, Sunset Crater itself, was the source of the Bonito and Kana-a lava flows that extended about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) NW and 9.6 kilometers (6 mi) NE, respectively. Additional vents along a 10-kilometer-long fissure (6.2 mi) extending SE produced small spatter ramparts and a 6.4-kilometer-long lava flow (4 mi) to the east. The Sunset Crater eruption produced a blanket of ash and lapilli covering an area of more than 2,100 square kilometers (810 sq mi) and forced the temporary abandonment of settlements of the local Sinagua people. The volcano has partially revegetated, with pines and wildflowers. The crater is the namesake for the Sunset Crater Beardtongue (Penstemon clutei). Since the last eruption of the volcano is a recent occurrence, it is considered dormant by volcanologists. Damage from hikers forced the National Park Service to close a trail leading to the crater, but a short trail at the base remains. The hiking trail below the summit skirts the substantial Bonito Lava Flow. This hardened lava is black and appears fresh as it has devastated the forest in its path. The lava flow also created an ice cave or tube that is now closed to the public after a partial collapse."

The exact GNIS location of its summit is 34°4′1″N 84°27′20″W﻿ / ﻿34.06694°N 84.45556°W, and it has an official (USGS) elevation of 1,688 ft (515 m) above mean sea level. It is the second-highest point in the county behind Kennesaw Mountain, and second in the core metro Atlanta area, behind Kennesaw Mountain, which is also in Cobb County. It is fifth if the exurban counties further north are considered. This height has made the mountain very attractive for radio, having several transmitters, radio towers, and antennas, for pagers, cellphones, broadcasting, and amateur radio. The fact that Stone Mountain and Kennesaw Mountain are both protected as parks has led to a proliferation of technology at the top. At the same time, both the antenna farm and the densely packed houses detract from the view of the mountain from surrounding areas of northeast Cobb, south-southeast Cherokee (including much of Woodstock), and western Roswell. Sweat Mountain is also a part of the ridge that divides the Chattahoochee River basin to the south and southeast, from the Lake Allatoona (Etowah River) basin to the north and northwest. From Sweat Mountain, this runs west-southwest through Cobb to Kennesaw Mountain and Lost Mountain."

The peak owes its name to the resemblance it shares with a woman's upturned breast. Due to its politically incorrect name, it is unlikely to receive official status, but is in common use. Belonging to the Fairholme Range in Kananaskis Provincial Park, Squaw's Tit is located 4,000 feet (1,200 m) above the Bow River valley. It is 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northwest of Lady Macdonald, just east of the Banff National Park gates."

The mountain was named in 1901 by its first climber, the English explorer Edward Whymper, after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, the sixth Governor-General of Canada. There are sources that date the naming in 1912 after Stanley H. Mitchell, Secretary-Treasurer of Alpine Club of Canada. The peak is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 93. Stanley Glacier on the northeast face of the peak can be seen up close by following a hiking trail into a hanging valley between the peak and a southern outlier of Storm Mountain. Stanley Peak can be ascended from a scrambling route by late summer but involves much routefinding among the many ledges and gullies on the north face. Climbing routes (UIAA III) travel the north and northeast faces."

  "text" : "Sakurajima (Japanese: 桜島, lit. \"Cherry Blossom Island\") is an active composite volcano (stratovolcano) and a former island in Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. The lava flows of the 1914 eruption caused the former island to be connected with the Osumi Peninsula. The volcanic activity still continues, dropping large amounts of volcanic ash on the surroundings. Earlier eruptions built the white sands highlands in the region. As of September 2015, the volcano is under a Level 3 (orange) alert by the Japan Meteorological Agency, signifying the volcano is active and should not be approached. The most recent eruption started on February 5, 2016. On 13 September 2016 a team of experts from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre in Japan suggested that the volcano could have a major eruption within 30 years. Sakurajima is a stratovolcano. Its summit has three peaks, Kita-dake (northern peak), Naka-dake (central peak) and Minami-dake (southern peak) which is active now. Kita-dake is Sakurajima's highest peak, rising to 1,117 m (3,665 ft) above sea level. The mountain is located in a part of Kagoshima Bay known as Kinkō-wan. The former island is part of the city of Kagoshima. The surface of this volcanic peninsula is about 77 km2 (30 sq mi)."

Its peak elevation is 7,177 feet (2,187.5 m) above sea level. It lies about 10.75 miles (17.30 km) southwest of the town of Shiprock, which is named for the peak. Governed by the Navajo Nation, the formation is in the Four Corners region and plays a significant role in Navajo religion, myth, and tradition. It is located in the center of the area occupied by the Ancient Pueblo People, a prehistoric Native American culture of the Southwest United States often referred to as the Anasazi. Shiprock is a point of interest for rock climbers and photographers and has been featured in several film productions and novels. It is the most prominent landmark in northwestern New Mexico."

You can gain access with The Scenic Rim Trail by Spicers that provides a guided walk to the summit . The upper section of the Peak displays views as far back as Brisbane and encompasses a world heritage listed rainforest. The name was given to the mountain by Allan Cunningham after Peter Spicer who was the Superintendent of convicts. Spicer had noted the peak while searching for escaped convicts. The peak is located just to the south of Spicers Gap which was once the main route between Brisbane and the Darling Downs."

  "text" : "The Schneeberg, with its 2,076-metre (6,811 ft) high summit Klosterwappen, is the highest mountain of Lower Austria, and the easternmost mountain in the Alps to exceed 2000 m. It is a distinctive limestone massif with steep slopes on three sides. The Schneeberg is one of the Northern Calcareous Alps in the borderland between Lower Austria and Styria, in the eastern part of Austria. It and the Rax (2,007 m or 6,585 ft), some 13 km (8.1 mi) to the south-west, are collectively considered the Viennese Hausberge (Vienna's \"local mountains\"). The rich Karst plateaux have provided drinking water for Vienna, via a 120 km (75 mi) long pipeline, since 1873, and is claimed to be the best drinking water in the world. On clear days, Schneeberg can be readily seen from parts of Vienna, some 65 km (40 mi) away (as the crow flies) and even from Bratislava in Slovakia. A rack-and-pinion railway, the Schneeberg Railway, now over 100 years old, climbs to a height of 1,800 m (5,900 ft), reducing the walk to the summit to an hour or two. There are also a number of other routes for walkers, including from the spa resort of Puchberg am Schneeberg to the east, or from the south, in Höllental. The summit plateau has a number of mountain huts which are visited by thousands of walkers, climbers and even mountain-bikers each year."

Part of the Mourne Mountains, it is the highest peak in Northern Ireland and in the wider province of Ulster. It is also the 19th highest peak on the island of Ireland. Slieve Donard sits near the town of Newcastle on the eastern coast of County Down, only 2 miles (3 km) from the Irish Sea. The Mourne Wall – built in the early 20th century – runs up the western and southern slopes of the mountain, joining a small stone tower at the summit. Also on the summit are the remains of two prehistoric burial cairns, one of which is the remains of the highest known passage tomb in Ireland. In Irish mythology the mountain was associated with, and named after, the mythical figures Boirche and Slángha. It was later associated with, and named after, Saint Donard, who was said to have made the summit his hermitage. Up until the 1830s, people would climb the mountain as part of a yearly pilgrimage, which may have originally been a Lughnasadh ritual. Royal Engineers camped on the summit for four months in 1826 as part of the Ordnance Survey's Principal Triangulation."

  "text" : "Stob Coire Sgreamhach is a mountain in Scotland, forming part of the Bidean nam Bian massif on the southern side of Glen Coe. It is often considered a subsidiary peak of Bidean, though since the 1997 revision of Munros Tables it has been classified as a separate Munro. The mountain is usually climbed in conjunction with Bidean nam Bian, thus allowing for a traverse of the range. One of the most common routes from Glen Coe is to ascend the head of Coire Gabhail (the Hidden Glen or Lost Valley) to reach the bealach between Stob Coire Sgreamhach and Bidean nam Bian. The wide floor of this corrie is hidden from view when seen from Glen Coe, and was used by the local Clan MacDonald to hide livestock, whether their own or stolen on raids. Another route of ascent is via Beinn Fhada, the most easterly of the famous Three Sisters of Glen Coe. This route also starts from Coire Gabhail, but then ascends steeply up the ridge that marks the southeastern edge of the glen. Stob Coire Sgreamhach may also be climbed from Glen Etive to the southeast by way of a steep rocky ridge."

  "text" : "Suilven (Scottish Gaelic: Sula Bheinn) is one of the most distinctive mountains in Scotland. Lying in a remote area in the west of Sutherland, it rises almost vertically from a wilderness landscape of moorland, bogs and lochans known as Inverpolly National Nature Reserve. Suilven forms a steep-sided ridge some 2 km in length. The highest point, known as Caisteal Liath (the Grey Castle in Scottish Gaelic), lies at the northwest end of this ridge. There are two other summits: Meall Meadhonach (Middle Round Hill) at the central point of the ridge is 723 m high, whilst Meall Beag (Little Round Hill) lies at the southeastern end. Geologically, Suilven is formed of Torridonian sandstone, sitting on a landscape of Lewisian Gneiss. The surrounding rocks were eroded during an episode of glaciation. Suilven was left poking above the level of the ice sheet, as a nunatak, with the flow of ice creating the distinctive narrow teardrop plan, while carving and scouring the vertical sides of the mountain. From the coast to the west Suilven looks like a large grey pillar, hence the name which it was given by sea-borne Vikings. From the inland side the mountain has more of the appearance of a steeply-sided pyramid. In 2005 Glencanisp estate, of which Suilven forms part and the neighbouring Drumrunie estate, were bought by the local community with the help of the John Muir Trust. The Assynt Foundation aims to create local employment and safeguard the natural and cultural heritage for the benefit of the community and future generations, and for the enjoyment of the wider public."

It erupted in 1988 and the island's inhabitants were evacuated. Between its first recorded eruption in 1512 and 1989 it erupted 17 times. It erupted again during December 2012 and May 2014. The island of Sangeang is part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is located northeast of Sumbawa in the Flores Sea, and is 13 km wide with an area of 153 km2. The earliest document mentioning about the Sang Hyang Api volcano was found in 14th century Majapahit script of Nagarakretagama.\"Gunung Api\" also appears as the name for the mountain in the first chapter of the novel The Long Journey by Johannes V. Jensen."

It was also strategically located at the centre of a string of other forts such as Rajgad, Purandar and Torna. Perched on an isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range of the Sahyadri Mountains, it is situated on a hill rising some 760 metres above ground level and 1,312 metres above mean sea level. Given natural protection by its very steep slopes, the walls and bastions were constructed at only key places; it has two gates – the Kalyan Darwaza in the south-east and the Pune Darwaza in the north-east."

  "text" : "Stac Pollaidh is a mountain in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. The peak displays a rocky crest of Torridonian sandstone, with many pinnacles and steep gullies. The ridge was exposed to weathering as a nunatak above the ice sheet during the last Ice Age, while the ice flow carved and scoured the smooth sides of the mountain. The modern Gaelic name is a recent invention. The peak is named on the first edition Ordnance Survey maps simply as \"An Stac\" (the pinnacle) and on later maps as \"Stac Polly\". The \"Polly\" element is of Norse origin, derived from \"Pollå\" meaning \"pool river\". Due to its relatively low height of just over 2000 feet, fine views and ease of access from a road it has become a very popular peak to climb. It also provides some fine scrambling in the traverse of the summit ridge, including one bad step near the final summit. Consequentially it has suffered from a great deal of erosion, leading to Scottish Natural Heritage constructing a large path."

Although less famous than the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare, Slieve League's cliffs reach almost three times higher. The Belfast naturalist Robert Lloyd Praeger wrote in 1939:A tall mountain of nearly 2000 feet, precipitous on its northern side, has been devoured by the sea till the southern face forms a precipice likewise, descending on this side right into the Atlantic from the long knife-edge which forms the summit. The traverse of this ridge, the \"One Man's Path\", is one of the most remarkable walks to be found in Ireland - not actually dangerous, but needing a good head and careful progress on a stormy day....The northern precipice, which drops 1500 feet into the coomb surrounding the Little Lough Agh, harbours the majority of the alpine plants of Slieve League, the most varied group of alpines to be found anywhere in Donegal."

It forms a twin-peak with Ben More, from which it is separated by the Bealach-eadar-dha Beinn, meaning pass between two hills. Stob Binnein is often climbed in conjunction with Ben More by means of the Bealach-eadar-dha Beinn. Descent may be made from the bealach direct to Benmore Burn. It may also be climbed from the south, starting near Inverlochlarig, some 8 km from Balquhidder. A route of about 5 km climbs from the glen, following the mountain's southern ridge over the intervening minor summits of Stob Invercarnaig and Stob Coire an Lochain."

It is visible from many parts of northern Montgomery County and southern Frederick County, notably from I-270 north of the town of Germantown. Because of its geological and natural history interest, it was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1969. It is a notable example of an admission-free, privately owned scenic park."

  "text" : "Santa Fe Baldy is a prominent summit in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico, United States, located 15 mi (24 km) northeast of Santa Fe. There are no higher mountains in New Mexico south of Santa Fe Baldy. It is prominent as seen from Los Alamos and communities along the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico, but is relatively inconspicuous from Santa Fe, as its north-south trending main ridge line is seen nearly end-on, disguising the size of the mountain. Tree line in the Sangre de Cristos is unusually high (exceeding 12,000 feet (3,700 m) in places) and only the top 600 to 800 feet (180 to 240 m) of the mountain is perpetually free of trees, but several severe forest fires have created bare spots extending to lower elevations. An extensive region of aspen trees on its flanks produces spectacular orange-yellow coloration during the fall that is the subject of many photographic studies. Santa Fe Baldy rises in the Pecos Wilderness within the Santa Fe National Forest, on the water divide between the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. The western slopes are drained by the Rio Capulin and the Rio Nambe, both flowing to the Rio Grande. The eastern side of the mountain consists of two small cirques, one containing Lake Katherine, one of the highest lakes in New Mexico at elevation 11,745 feet (3,580 m). Lake Katherine was given its name by theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer The peak is accessed by Trail 251, the Skyline Trail, which climbs to a saddle about 1,000 feet (300 m) below the summit; the remaining distance is covered by a steep unofficial trail along the ridgeline. Under good conditions the summit is a simple \"walk-up\" climb, but the Sangre de Cristos are unusually prone to lightning, and during the summer months, the wise hiker is off Santa Fe Baldy and other high summits in the range by noon, to avoid afternoon thunderstorms. Nearby peaks include Lake Peak, 12,409 feet (3,782 m) and Tesuque Peak, 12,043 feet (3,671 m), both located about 3 miles (4.8 km) to the south of Santa Fe Baldy. Santa Fe Ski Basin is on the western slopes of Tesuque Peak. On 11 June 2009, Santa Fe Baldy was the scene of a helicopter accident that claimed the life of New Mexico State Police Sergeant Andrew Tingwall and University of New Mexico graduate student Megumi Yamamoto. The helicopter crashed after Tingwall rescued Yamamoto. Yamamoto had been hiking with her boyfriend, but had become lost."

It can also be seen by southbound travelers on nearby sections of the New York State Thruway. This view was popular with early artists of the Hudson River School, and helped give them their name. While thought of as the highest in the area, its summit reaching approximately 1,340 feet (410 m) above sea level, the eastern summit officially known as Butter Hill is actually higher, at 1,380 feet (420 m) in elevation."

  "text" : "Slemish, historically called Slieve Mish (from Irish: Sliabh Mis), is a mountain in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It lies a few miles east of Ballymena, in the townland of Carnstroan. Tradition holds that Saint Patrick, enslaved as a youth, was brought to this area and tended sheep herds on Slemish, and that during this time he found God. Slemish is the remains of the plug of an extinct volcano. The plug is made of olivine dolerite and was formed during the Palaeogene period of the Earth's geological history. Its distinctive appearance —its upper reaches are very steep and rugged, in contrast to the tidy fields on its lower westward-facing slopes and the relatively flat bogland to the east— causes it to dominate the landscape for miles around. Slemish is within an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and, therefore, helps to protect and manage the fragile animal and plant communities that inhabit its slopes. An ideal location for bird watchers, large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and meadow pipits can be seen regularly."

The summit of Stybarrow Dodd is a smooth, rounded, grassy dome, like its two northern neighbours, Watson's Dodd and Great Dodd. Together, these three rather similar fells are sometimes called “The Three Dodds.” All three are covered by the same sheet of volcanic rock."

  "text" : "The Slieve Bloom Mountains (Sliabh Bladhma in Irish) are a mountain range in Ireland. They rise from the central plain of Ireland to a height of 527 metres. While not very high, they are extensive by local standards. The highest points are Arderin (527 m) at the southwestern end of the range and Baunreaghcong (511 m) at the end of the Ridge of Capard. The Slieve Bloom Mountains stretch from near Roscrea in the south west to Rosenallis in the north west forming a link between County Laois and County Offaly. Access to the mountains and the most popular attractions is easiest by taking Exit 18 off the M7 for Mountmellick and following the R422 for Rosenallis, Clonaslee, Cadamstown, and Kinnitty. There are 3 routes which cross the mountain. From Clonaslee here it is very easy to follow the mountain road over 'the Cut' towards Mountrath. From Kinnitty take the road from the centre of the village opposite the Catholic Church past Longford Church to Glendine Gap near Ard Erin the highest point in the mountain. For some splendid views turn left onto the R440 towards Kinnitty one of the small villages nestled at the foot of the mountains. Looped walking trails have been developed at 6 trail heads in the Slieve Blooms, Glenbarrow, Clonaslee, Cadamstown, Kinnitty, Glenafelly Forest Car Park and Glen Monicknew. Walking trails are colour-coded green easy, blue moderate, and red most difficult. The 84 km Slieve Bloom Way colour-coded yellow can be accessed from any of these trailheads. In Cadamstown take time to walk the Silver River Eco Trail. Glenbarrow waterfalls are located just a few miles from Rosenallis. Some scenic looped walks will take you to the falls and up onto the Ridge of Capard. There is a significant population of red grouse in the hills. The Slieve Bloom, along with the Massif Central in France, are the oldest mountains in Europe; they were once also the highest at 3,700m. Weathering has reduced them to 527m. On a clear day, one can see the high points of the four ancient provinces of Ireland."

South Twin forms the high point of a north-south ridge, with North Twin Mountain lying approximately one mile to the north and Mount Guyot two miles (3 km) to the southeast. Galehead Mountain, a lower spur of South Twin, is to the west. The east face of South Twin drains into the Little River, thence into the Ammonoosuc and Connecticut Rivers, and into Long Island Sound in Connecticut. The northwest slopes of South Twin drain to the North Branch of the Gale River, another tributary of the Ammonoosuc River. Southwest of South Twin Mountain is the valley of Twin Brook, which flows into the Franconia Branch of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River, through the Pemigewasset Wilderness, thence into the Pemigewasset and Merrimack Rivers, and into the Gulf of Maine in Massachusetts. The summit of South Twin is open and rocky, but stands of spruce and fir trees grow in close proximity. The Appalachian Trail, a 2,170-mile (3,500-km) National Scenic Trail from Georgia to Maine, crosses the summit of South Twin, passing from Galehead Mountain (and Galehead Hut) to the west towards Mount Guyot to the southeast. The North Twin Trail proceeds north along the ridge crest to the summit of North Twin."

From the summit there are views over the Aire valley, to Gargrave, Skipton and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, to the east into Wharfedale and to the north into Malhamdale. Although Ordnance Survey maps do not show a path to the summit, there is a path from the public bridleway to the north: both are clear on the ground, and popular with cyclists.

  "text" : "The Silberhorn (3,695 m) is a pyramid-shaped mountain of the Bernese Alps, to the northwest of the Jungfrau of which it is a satellite peak. A first attempt to reach the summit of the Silberhorn was made in June 1863 by M. v. Fellenberg from the Stufensteinalp on the east side of the valley of Lauterbrunnen. After 9 hours of most perilous climbing the party encountered an impracticable precipice of rock, and were forced to return. In the following month of August MM. Badeker and v. Fellenberg, with two guides of Grindelwald, and others, reached the summit from the Wengernalp. Ascending by the Guggi Glacier, they passed a night on the rocks at the foot of the Schneehorn, a buttress of the Jungfrau dividing the Guggi and Giessen Glaciers. On the following day they gained the desired summit by a long and difficult circuit under the cliffs of the Jungfrau. The still longer and equally difficult ascent of the Jungfrau was effected from this side for the first time two years later. The northwest ridge was first ascended in 1865 by the Rev. James John Hornby, Rev. Thomas Henry Philpot, with guides Christian and Ulrich Almer, Johann Bischof and Christian Lauener. In a 1968 letter, J. R. R. Tolkien identified the Silberhorn as it appeared to him when camping near Mürren in 1911 as \"the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams\"."

  "text" : "Swyre Head is the highest point of the Purbeck Hills and the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, on the south coast of England. The hill Swyre Head lies about 2 kilometres (1 mi) southwest of the village Kingston, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) south of Corfe Castle and 8 kilometres (5 mi) west of Swanage. Although not very high, its relative height is such that it nearly qualifies as a Marilyn. The chalk hill is part of the extensive Southern England Chalk Formation. Swyre Head by Kingston should not be confused with another Dorset hill called Swyre Head, at an elevation of 98 metres (322 ft), on the coast, located at grid reference SY799805, to the west of Durdle Door. The two Swyre Heads are about four hours walk apart from each other; that is, 18 kilometres (11 mi). The hill commands extensive views, including west past the Isle of Portland to Dartmoor, and east to the Isle of Wight, as well as north across the Purbeck Hills to Poole Harbour and the other Purbeck Marilyn, Nine Barrow Down. To the west, the folly of Clavell Tower can also be seen. Set back about 800 metres (half a mile) from the coast, the hill is not on the South West Coast Path, but can be reached easily from the villages of Kingston or Kimmeridge. The hill has a trig point marked as 203 metres on Ordnance Survey maps, but a tumulus, now fully grassed over, forms the highest point, 208 metres (682 ft) above sea level."

  "text" : "The Stawamus Chief, officially Stawamus Chief Mountain (often referred to as simply The Chief, or erroneously as the Squamish Chief), is a granite dome located adjacent to the town of Squamish, British Columbia. It towers over 700 m (2,297 ft) above the waters of nearby Howe Sound. It is often claimed to be the \"second largest granite monolith in the world\". The Squamish, indigenous people from this area, consider the Chief to be a place of spiritual significance. The Squamish language name for the mountain is Siám' Smánit (siám is usually translated as \"chief\" though it is really a social ranking), and their traditions say it is a longhouse transformed to stone by Xáays, as the Transformer Brothers are known in this language. The great cleft in the mountain's cliff-face in Squamish legend is a mark of corrosion left by the skin of Sínulhka, a giant two-headed sea serpent. The mountain gets its name from their village near its foot, Stawamus (St'a7mes), as is also the case with the Stawamus River and Stawamus Lake, though the pronunciation of the village name is different than as commonly used in English (/ˈstɑːʔəməs/ is an approximation of the Squamish language, vs /stəˈwɑːmᵿs/ as commonly used in English)."

Unlike many of its grander neighbours, Swinside is a Marilyn as a result of being surrounded by a moat of low boggy ground. Until recently it was also completely covered by trees, but a track now leads up to the summit where the trees have been felled. The land is privately owned and there is no public footpath to the summit although the owner recently allowed local residents from the nearby village of Portinscale to visit the summit on a sponsored walk."

  "text" : "Slipdown Mountain is a summit in Parker County, Texas. It is located just east of the Advance Community (near Poolville), and along with Slipdown Bluff is the highest point in Parker County, and also the highest point within the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex. The \"mountain\" is beside Slip Down Road, and has a steep limestone cliff on the west side. In the History of Parker County, Eunice Boley Harris mentions Slipdown Mountain in her article about the Advance Community: \"We also had a 'fun spot' near Advance called 'Slip Down Mountain.' Young and old alike met there for baseball, Easter egg hunts, wiener roasts, picnics, and 'dinner on the ground.'\" The first white settlers to the area arrived in the early 1850s. James Lanman settled the Western flank, William H Dunison to the South, and Thomas Sullivan to the Southeast. At this time this was still Comanche country and accounts of early Indian raids can be found in the book A Cry Unheard. by Doyle Marshall and in the History of Parker County and the Double Log Cabin by G.A. Holland. One such raid, the Sullivan-Blackwell attack, took place in 1866. Six-year-old Thomas Sullivan Jr. and cousin Fremont Blackwell, seven, were taken captive. Thommy was later killed but Fremont lived with the Indians for over a year before being ransomed. An account of this raid by Fremont’s younger brother Benjamin can be found on the Oklahoma Gen Web site. One of the theories as to the name “Slipdown Mountain” comes from this period. Today the area is covered with live oaks and cedars, but in 1850 this area was grassland prairie and one could see for miles in every direction. The Comanches could use this high ground as a vantage point to observe the settlers and then “slip down” into the homesteads on their night time raids. In 1856 the State of Texas granted a railroad right-of-way to the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific RR which was later bought by the Texas & Pacific RR. The survey for the right-of-way was done in 1861 and all land not already homesteaded was sectioned off and became part of the RR reserve and the Texas Permanent School Fund. Then in 1889 A.J Stratton bought the high point and surrounding land from the School Fund for $3/ acre. A J’s son George was one of the founders of the nearby town of Advance one mile to the West. The thriving town had a general store, two gins, a public school, and churches that were active until after WWII. Today nothing remains of the town but the place name."

South Branch Mountain is among the largest and most prominent of the mountains in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians of the Eastern Panhandle region. It forms the eastern edge of the South Branch Potomac River Valley from Springfield to Moorefield. The mountain was originally named Jersey Mountain by colonial settlers in the eighteenth century after Jersey. The Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) climbs South Branch Mountain between Shanks and Romney in an area known as Sunrise Summit. The forested wetlands that were once located here on the mountain's top were destroyed by the expansive commercial and residential developments in the Sunrise Summit area along US 50. Further south near Moorefield, the construction of Corridor H has caused increased disruption to South Branch Mountain's forests, habitats, and topography."

The northern end of Spring Gap Mountain is located south of West Virginia Route 9 southeast of Paw Paw. During the French and Indian War (1754–1763), Major General Edward Braddock's march from Winchester, Virginia to Cumberland, Maryland took him and his men across Spring Gap Mountain. Braddock and his men camped atop Spring Gap Mountain because of the abundance of fresh drinking water at the mountain's \"Spring Gap.\" From the mountain, Braddock and his men traveled downhill to the Little Cacapon River, which they followed to Fort Cox on the Potomac River."

  "text" : "Slide Mountain is the highest peak in the Catskills. It is located in the Town of Shandaken in Ulster County, in southern New York. While the 4,180-foot (1,270 m) contour line on topographic maps is generally accepted as its height, the exact elevation of the summit has never been officially determined by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and many informal surveys suggest the mountain may actually top 4,200 feet (1,280 m) above sea level. While it was not identified as the range's highest peak until the late 19th century, it has played a prominent role in Catskill history. Renowned naturalist John Burroughs wrote memorably of his climbs up Slide, and it helped get the Catskills added to New York's Forest Preserve. Bicknell's thrush was first identified on its summit."

  "text" : "San Bruno Mountain is located in northern San Mateo County, California, with some slopes of the mountain crossing over into southern San Francisco. Most of the mountain lies within the 2,326-acre (941 ha) San Bruno Mountain State Park, a unique open-space island in the midst of the San Francisco Peninsula's urbanization. Next to the state park is the 83-acre (34 ha) state San Bruno Mountain Ecological Reserve on the north slope. It is near the southern boundary of San Francisco, surrounded by the cities of South San Francisco, Daly City, Colma, and Brisbane. San Bruno Mountain is topped by a four mile long ridge. Trails to the summit afford expansive views of the San Francisco Bay Area. Radio Peak (elevation 1,319 feet or 402 metres) is the highest point, hosting several radio broadcast towers, KTSF television, ION's KKPX television and NBC's KNTV Television, serving a huge area that would otherwise have poor service in the hilly Bay Area region. The mountain provides habitat for several species of rare and endangered plants and butterflies. The endangered San Bruno elfin butterfly inhabits this mountain and a few other locations. The distinct Franciscan fog zone plants of San Bruno Mountain set it apart from other California coastal areas."

The mountain is located just west of the municipal boundary with Stranda and just north of the nearby mountain Jakta. Many famous Norwegians have been on the top of this mountain, including most notably Queen Sonja of Norway. Even though it is not among the highest peaks in Norway, the 1,564-metre (5,131 ft) tall mountain is rated among the top ten mountain walks in Norway. This is largely due to its beauty, view, and the fact that it's rising directly from the fjord. Legend has it that Slogen was first climbed in 1870 by Jon Klokk. Later on that year it was climbed by the famous climber and alpine explorer William Cecil Slingsby. The latter wrote about the view from Slogen as \"one of the proudest in Europe\"."

It is located close to St Catherine's Point, the southernmost point on the island, and rises to 240 metres at its highest point, between the towns of Niton and Chale. At the peak of the hill is St. Catherine's Oratory, locally known as the \"Pepperpot\", a stone lighthouse built in the 14th century by Walter De Godeton. It is the second oldest lighthouse in the British Islands. Only the Roman-built lighthouse at Dover is older. Reportedly, de Godeton was found guilty for having scavenged wine, belonging to the Church, from the wreck of the St. Marie of Bayonne in Chale Bay. He was ordered to make amends, under threat of excommunication by building this lighthouse. Fires were lit in the lighthouse tower to warn ships at sea of the presence of the coast. There was an attached chapel at one time, but it has been long since demolished. There is a Bronze Age barrow nearby which was excavated in the 1920s. A replacement lighthouse was begun in 1785, but was never completed. Locally this half finished building is known as the \"salt pot\". St. Catherine's Point is often foggy, so it is not the best location for a lighthouse. There is a lighthouse built after the wreck of the Clarendon in 1837 to the west of Niton at the foot of the Undercliff. The northern end of St. Catherine's Down is host to the Hoy Monument. The Hoy Monument was created by Michael Hoy in 1814 to commemorate the visit of the Russian Tsar to Great Britain, hence its informal alternative name, the \"Russian Monument\". There is an 1857 plaque at the base of the Hoy Monument that commemorates the soldiers killed in the Crimean War. The Hoy Monument was repaired in 1992 at a cost of £85,000, which was donated."

In 1545 a French invasion force attempted this against a force of the Isle of Wight Militia commanded by Sir John Fyssher- which allegedly included several women archers- and were routed.In 1940 the radar station was bombed by Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers, which is reconstructed in the film \"The Battle of Britain\".

  "text" : "Squak Mountain is the second most westerly mountain of the Issaquah Alps mountain chain in Washington state. It is situated between Cougar Mountain to the west and Tiger Mountain to the east. Interstate 90 parallels the base of the north side of the mountain. Much of the Squak Mountain watershed drains into Lake Sammamish. Most of the mountain is protected by Squak Mountain State Park and Cougar/Squak and Squak/Tiger Corridors of King County. Squak Mountain actually consists of three major peaks: the Central Peak (Elevation 2024 feet), the West Peak (Elevation 1995 feet), and the Southeast Peak (Elevation 1673 feet). The name \"Squak\" comes from the Southern Lushootseed placename /sqʷásxʷ/, which is also the source of the name Issaquah Creek and the city of Issaquah."

The summit lies in the central part of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, to the south-east of Mount Elbrus, Europe's highest mountain. Shkhara is the third highest peak in the Caucasus, just behind Dykh-Tau. Shkhara is the high point and the eastern anchor of a massif known as the Bezingi (or Bezengi) Wall, a 12 kilometres (7 mi) long ridge. It is a large, steep peak in a heavily glaciated region, and presents serious challenges to mountaineers. Its north face (on the Russian side) is 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) high and contains several classic difficult routes. The significant subsummit Shkhara West, 5,068 m (16,627 ft), is a climbing objective in its own right, and a traverse of the entire Bezingi Wall is considered \"Europe's longest, most arduous, and most committing expedition.\" The peak was first climbed in 1888 via the North East Ridge route, by the British/Swiss team of U. Almer, J. Cockin and C. Roth. This route is still one of the easier and more popular routes on the mountain. The first complete traverse of the Bezingi Wall was in 1931, by the Austrians K. Poppinger, K. Moldan, and S. Schintlmeister."

  "text" : "Silver Star Mountain is an extinct volcano in the southwestern Cascade Mountains in the U.S. state of Washington, named for the pattern of five prominent ridges that radiate from the summit in the shape of a star. The two peaks of the mountain dominate the horizon east of Vancouver, Washington. The mountain is the focus of the Silver Star Scenic Area. In September 1902 Silver Star Mountain was the center of the Yacolt Burn, the largest fire in Washington history until 2014, which took 38 lives and burned over 238,000 acres (963 km2) The smoke was so thick that street lights glowed at noon in Seattle 160 miles (260 km) away. With the loss of vegetative ground cover, a series of rockslides occurred on the slopes of Silver Star Mountain and neighboring uplands that also were affected by the fire. The result is a landscape that has resisted natural reforestation for more than a century. Wildflowers and other species of flora that thrive above the timberline, elsewhere in Washington, are found here despite the altitude being 2,000 feet (600 m) lower than the timberline usually is in the region. Silver Star Mountain is the center of a pluton of magma that was injected into the area 20 million years ago and cooled to solid rock under the surface, producing small deposits of gold, zinc, copper, zeolites, quartz and calcite. Small abandoned gold mines can be found in creek bottoms throughout the area. E.A. Dole, an early settler, struck silver on the mountain in 1874. He named the mine Silver Star Quartz Ledge. The ore gathered was assayed at 41.17 silver and 63.72 lead per ton. The higher north peak was once the site of a fire lookout. There is an unobstructed 360 degree view of the entire Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, as well as views of the Columbia River Gorge, the Pacific Coast Range, Mount Saint Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount Jefferson. The area is accessed from the west by a trailhead on County Grade Road 1200 at Grouse Creek Vista, which is a pass between Silver Star Mountain and Larch Mountain. Forest Road 4109 scales the northern ridge to a trailhead 1.9 miles (3.1 km) from the summit. The highest point in Clark County, Washington, is Sturgeon Rock, a basalt outcrop that lies on the county line just west of the Silver Star summit. For many years an error on United States Geological Survey topographical maps has misnamed a broad wooded peak lower on the ridge near the Tarbell Trail as Sturgeon Rock."

  "text" : "Slhanay, formerly known as The Squaw is a large dome of granitic rock located adjacent to the town of Squamish, British Columbia. Although the mountain, known as Slhanay in the language of the Skwxwu7mesh people is indeed an impressive geological formation, it tends to be overshadowed by the Stawamus Chief, a much larger granitic dome located immediately south-west. The use of the term \"squaw\" as a name for the dome is controversial. For a long time, no alternative had been successfully applied, probably due in large part to local tradition and an inability to get such an alternative name to \"stick\". This was remedied in 2009 when the new name Slhanay was adopted for the area after consultation with local First Nations. The Slhanay is situated within the boundaries of the Stawamus Chief Provincial Park. A partially maintained hiking trail, accessible from the Chief's main \"backside\" trail, leads to the Slhanay summit area. This trail is rugged and the Slhanay summit area is seldom visited. However, the sheer rock walls on Slhanay's west face are greatly appreciated by rock climbers who access them from the nearby Mamquam Forest Service Road."

A public right of way passes over the summit. It is an outlier of the Marilyn Watch Hill, and gives good views of the Lord's Seat group of hills, although it is too low to afford views towards the central Lake District. It lies just inside the boundary of the Lake District National Park."

  "text" : "Mount Smolikas (Greek: Σμόλικας, Aromanian: Smolcu) is a mountain in the Ioannina regional unit, northwestern Greece. At a height of 2,637 metres above sea level, it is the highest of the Pindus Mountains, and the second highest mountain in Greece after Mount Olympus. The mountain consists of ophiolite rocks. During several periods in the Pleistocene the northern and eastern cirques and valleys were glaciated. The last glaciers of this area retreated around 11,500 years ago. It is drained by the river Aoos to the south, and the river Vourkopotamo (a tributary of the Sarantaporos) to the north. There is a small alpine lake called \"Drakolimni Smolika\" near the summit, at about 2200 m elevation. Nearby mountain ranges are Tymfi to the south, Gramos to the northwest, Vasilitsa to the southeast and Voio to the northeast. The higher elevations, above 2000 m, consist of grasslands and rocks, and there are deciduous and conifer forests at lower elevations. The mountain lies completely within the municipality of Konitsa, the main villages around the mountain being Agia Paraskevi to the north, and Palaioselli, Pades and Armata to the south. The town Konitsa lies 15 km southwest of Smolikas. The Greek National Road 20 (Kozani - Siatista - Konitsa - Ioannina) passes west of the mountain."

  "text" : "Sangemarmar-togetherness Sangemarmar Sar (or Sangemar Mar, Sang-e-Marmar, Sangemarmur) is a pyramidal peak in the Batura Muztagh, at the end of a spur ridge running southwest from Pasu Sar in Pakistan. It lies between the Muchuhar Glacier, on the west, and the Shispare (or Hasanabad) Glacier on the east. Because it is much lower in elevation than many of the surrounding peaks, such as Batura Sar and Rakaposhi, Sangemarmar Sar is little-known, and there has been only one successful ascent of the peak, according to the Himalayan Index. However, because of its location on the southern flank of the main crest of the range, relatively near the Hunza Valley, it does enjoy tremendous vertical relief above local terrain.For example, its summit rises over 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) above the Hunza River, in a horizontal distance of 15 kilometres (9 mi). The mountain was named (as \"Sangemarmur\", meaning \"marble\", after a conspicuousband of yellow marble crossing the summit) in 1964 by the First Canadian Himalayan Expedition, comprising Fred Roots (leader), Donald Lyon, John Ricker, Lisle Irwin, Donald Poole, Hermann Jamek, Momin Khalifa and Karl Tomm. They intended to locate and climb Hachindar Chhish, which they determined to be a peak a few kilometers to the west of Sangemarmar Sar; however that peak proved too difficult and technical for the party to attempt. The expedition reached 6,300 metres (20,700 ft) but was then forced to retreat by repeated heavy snowstorms. On July 11, 1984, a team from Osaka University made the first ascent of the mountain via the southwest ridge. The expedition comprised Takashi Matsuo (leader), Hiromi Okuyama, Takehiro Hirota, Tokio Kozuki, Masaya Oishi, Toru Sakakibara, Kenya Sato, Shinichi Miyata, Tomoyoshi Mizukawa, Hiroyuki Onishi, and Akira Noguchi. All members reached the summit, on two separate days. They encountered ice up to 50 degrees. They used three high camps, and fixed 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) of rope."

The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie because its snow-capped massif resembles a dome. The mountain, reaching a height of 3,456 m (11,339 ft), is possibly a hydrological apex of North America, depending on the definition of the boundary between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and of which of those hydrographic regions Hudson Bay is considered to be a part. (The other apex is Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park, Montana, United States.) At any rate, it is a major triple divide between three great drainage basins. Water falling on Snow Dome's summit may flow into streams that drain into the Pacific Ocean (via Bryce Creek, the Bush River and the Columbia River), the Arctic Ocean (via the Sunwapta and Athabasca Rivers), and Hudson Bay (via the North Saskatchewan River). The Dome Glacier flows to the north-east, the Stutfield Glacier to the north-west, the Columbia Glacier to the west and Athabasca Glacier flows to the east of the mountain."

It is located in the San Juan Mountains in Hinsdale County approximately 9 miles (14 km) south west of Lake City, and about 1 mile (1.6 km) south of Redcloud Peak. It rises on the north side of the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River. Sunshine Peak has the dubious distinction of being the lowest of Colorado's 53 fourteeners. It is also not particularly independent from its higher neighbor Redcloud Peak, with a topographic prominence of 481 feet (147 m) (the minimum standard for an independent fourteener is 300 feet (91 m)). However it has more and steeper local relief than many of the other fourteeners. For example, it rises 4,450 feet (1,356 m) above the townsite of Sherman to the south in only 1.2 miles (1.9 km)."

Composed primarily of steeply tilted layers of Navajo and Wingate Sandstone, it has been eroded into tall fins, domes, cliffs, and deep canyons. The San Rafael River, Interstate 70, and Muddy Creek all cut through the San Rafael Reef. There are also numerous slot canyons that twist their way through the flanks of the San Rafael Reef, among them Crack Canyon, Chute Canyon and Straight Wash. These spectacularly beautiful canyons are often just a few feet wide and can be hundreds of feet deep. Much of the San Rafael Reef has been determined to possess wilderness characteristics and the Crack Canyon and Mexican Mountain Wilderness Study Areas, or WSAs, currently protect several thousand acres of the most worthy areas of the San Rafael Reef, and are awaiting hoped-for designation as BLM Wilderness by the Congress. \n* Shadows of contrails over San Rafael Reef —San Rafael Swell, Reef (perimeter), and San Rafael Desert at south & southeast. The Reef is most of the southeast, and east perimeter of the 45-mi wide (west-to-east) San Rafael Swell (which trends southwest-by-northeast). \n* Approach to the San Rafael Reef-(eastern end), from Interstate 70, which crosses through the Reef onto the San Rafael Swell, east-to-west looking. \n* Interstate 70 cuts through the impressive San Rafael Reef from the east."

The summit is at 10,267 feet (3,129 m). Spruce Mountain is on a northeast–southwest trending ridge with a parallel Spruce Ridge to the northwest. To the east, a low section of hills connects the mountain to the south end of the Pequop Mountains. US Route 93 passes the southwest end of the mountain. The peak is on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and thus has no access restrictions. The western side of the mountain was the site of copper, silver, and lead mining during the late 19th century. The settlement of Sprucemont on the western slope of the mountain supported the mining activity and existed from 1868 through about 1900 and is now a ghost town. Electronics researcher Ralph Hartley was born at Sprucemont in 1888."

  "text" : "Sloan Peak is a mountain in the North Cascades of Washington state. It rises about 40 miles (64 km) east of Everett, Washington and 12 miles southwest of Glacier Peak, one of the Cascade stratovolcanoes. It is located, between the north and south forks of Sauk River, in the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. The summit is situated about 4 miles (6.4 km) east of the Mountain Loop Highway. Sloan Peak has been called the \"Matterhorn of the Cascades\" for its sharp, high peak, which is accentuated by its impressive local relief and its isolated position west of the Cascade crest. It is easily visible from many locations in the North Cascades. On both the east and southwest sides, Sloan's summit rises more than one vertical mile (1.6 km) above the valley floor in less than two horizontal miles (3.2 km). The standard route on the peak climbs the South Face and Upper West Face, but it is also known as the \"Corkscrew Route\" due to its winding nature. It starts on the north side of the peak, and traverses the Sloan Glacier to reach the east edge of the South Face; the route then continues to turn around the peak to reach the summit via the Upper West Face. The usual approach is via Forest Service Road No. 48 and Forest Service Trail No. 649. The trail crosses the North Fork of the Sauk River, and no bridge is provided, although a log may be present. The total elevation gain of the route is 5,935 feet (1,809 m). It involves snow and glacier climbing and some rock scrambling (class 3). Other more technical routes exist on Sloan's other faces."

  "text" : "Stickle Pike is an outlying fell located in the southern Lake District near the small town of Broughton-in-Furness, with the summit situated between the lower Duddon Valley and the quiet smaller valley of Dunnerdale. Despite its low altitude (375 m, or 1230 ft) the sharp, conical summit is prominent in views from the Broughton and high Furness areas. As with many of the Dunnerdale and Coniston fells, there are reminders of the area's former mining past in the form of many spoil heaps, disused levels and shafts. The fell is also notable for its superb views despite its low altitude, especially to the Scafells to the north and the sands of the Duddon Estuary to the south. A \"stickle\" is a hill with a prominent rocky top. The fell is most easily (and commonly) ascended from the Kiln Bank fell road between Hall Dunnerdale and Broughton Mills, with the top lying less than half a mile from the road summit. An alternative ascent (suggested by Alfred Wainwright) can be made from Broughton Mills along the Great Stickle/Tarn Hill ridge, with a return either down the Dunnerdale valley road or via the bridleway on the east side of the valley. The fell is the subject of a chapter of Wainwright's book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. His clockwise circuit from Broughton Mills includes Great Stickle at 990 feet (300 m), Tarn Hill at 1,231 feet (375 m), Stickle Pike, Raven's Crag (called \"a nameless summit\" by Wainwright) at 1,183 feet (361 m), and The Knott at 925 feet (282 m), this last sharing its name with The Knott above Hayeswater in the far eastern fells and another outlying fell near Stainton Pike, as well as with Knott north of Skiddaw."

  "text" : "Slioch (Scottish Gaelic: Sleaghach) is a mountain in the Scottish Highlands situated in Wester Ross, eight kilometres north of the village of Kinlochewe. Slioch reaches a height of 981 metres (3218 feet) and towers above the south east end of Loch Maree to give one of the best known and most photographed sights (from the A832 road) in the Highlands. VisitScotland, the Scottish national tourist agency, has used video footage of Slioch in its television advertisements. The mountain is composed of Torridonian sandstone on a base of Lewisian Gneiss and has steep crags on three sides and allows easy access for the walker only from the south east where the large open corrie of Coire na Sleaghaich has two ridges on its flanks which the walker can utilise. The mountain's name comes from the Gaelic word “sleagh” and means “the spear” and this only becomes obvious when Slioch is viewed from Lochan Fada to the west, from here the subsidiary top of Sgurr an Tuill Bhain (Peak of the White Hollow) (933 metres) dominates as a slender peak and gives the mountain its name. Wild goats are often seen on the mountain."

Slieve Gullion (from Irish: Sliabh gCuillinn, meaning \"mountain of the steep slope\") is a mountain in the south of County Armagh, Northern Ireland. The mountain is the heart of the Ring of Gullion and is the highest point in the county, with an elevation of 573 metres (1,880 ft). At the summit is a small lake and two ancient burial cairns, one of which is the highest surviving passage grave in Ireland. Slieve Gullion plays a prominent role in the mythology and history of the area and dominates the countryside around it, offering views of as far away as Antrim, Dublin Bay and Wicklow on a clear day. Villages around Slieve Gullion include Drumintee, Mullaghbawn, Lislea, Forkhill and Meigh. The mountain gives its name to the surrounding countryside, and is the name of an electoral area within Newry and Mourne district council. The last local forester, James Toal, a Forkhill native, did more than most to promote the area i.e. South Armagh Festival."

  "text" : "The Spanish Peaks are a pair of prominent mountains located in southwestern Huerfano County, Colorado. The Ute Indians named them Huajatolla (pronounced Wa-ha-toy-a), meaning \"two breasts\" or \"breasts of the Earth\". The two peaks, West Spanish Peak (13,626 feet or 4,153 meters) and East Spanish Peak (12,683 feet or 3,866 meters), are east of, and separate from, the Culebra Range of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. West Spanish Peak is the easternmost mountain over 4,000 meters in the United States. The Spanish Peaks were formed by two separate shallow (or hypabyssal) igneous intrusions during the Late-Oligocene epoch of the Paleogene Period. West Spanish Peak is an older (24.59 +/- 0.13 Ma) quartz syenite while East Spanish Peak (23.36 +/- 0.18 Ma) is composed of granite and granodiorite porphyry. The Spanish Peaks were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1976 as one of the best known examples of igneous dikes. They were an important landmark on the Santa Fe Trail. The mountains can be seen as far north as Colorado Springs (133 miles (214 km)), as far west as Alamosa (85 miles (137 km)), points south to Raton, New Mexico (65 miles (105 km)), and points east of Trinidad (up to 15 miles (24 km)). The Spanish Peaks Wilderness area of 17,855 acres (72.3 km2) encompasses the summits of both Spanish peaks. Hiking is popular in the wilderness area."

  "text" : "Skarstind (official form on maps: Skardstinden) is a prominent part of the Galdhøpiggen mountain range in northwestern Jotunheimen, Norway, and is the sixth highest summit in the country. The mountain has three summits, the main summit at 2,373 meters above sea level, Nåle, the Needle, at 2,310 m and the small western summit at 2,215 m. It is located within the municipality of Lom, (in Oppland) on the eastern side of the Leirdalen valley, and the summit can be seen from the road along the valley floor. There are several other peaks in the vicinity, but only Galdhøpiggen, a few kilometers to the east, is higher. The mountain can be seen from most of the higher peaks in Jotunheimen and Breheimen to the northwest. The first part of the name Skarstind is one of the Norwegian words for mountain pass, although it is impossible to say which pass has given its name to the mountain. It might be the pass to the south or it might be the pass between the summit itself and the pinnacle, Nåle. Nåle, the Needle, has got its name from the local word for pinnacle, which describes the shape of it. The summit was reached for the first time in 1884 by Severin Wleugel, Sig. Thor, Oskar Kristiansen. The first ascent of the two lower summits remains unknown, but it is probable that they were climbed at the same time. The views, except towards the east, where Galdhøpiggen blocks the view, are among the best in Jotunheimen. To the west, you see the Smørstabbtindene range, the Hurrungane range and the Jostedalsbreen glacier. To the northwest you see the Hestbrepiggane range and to the south you see most of the summits in central Jotunheimen. The shape of the mountain is extremely characteristic. Only from northwest does it look like a 'tind' a high pointy summit in Norwegian. From the east, from Galdhøpiggen, it shows its steep wall with Nåle balancing on the left flank, as seen in the table. This wall is one of the more inaccessible in Jotunheimen and is climbed rarely. The southwest face is less forbidding, and it is possible to find a way up through the partly snow-covered talus slopes. The mountain, as its neighbors, consists of the hard gabbro rock, which withstands erosion better than most other rocks. The orientation of the layers of gabbro in Skarstind is uncommon. Normally they rise from northwest towards southeast, which is why many summits are easiest to reach from the north side. At Skarstind the layers rise from southwest towards northeast. This is easily seen on the photo in the table. The summit can be reached without equipment if the conditions are good and there is very little snow on the talus slopes on the southwest face. The normal ascent starts from Leirdalen up to Dummhøe, which is an easy, but rather steep climb of more than 1000 meters. Up to approximately 1500 meters, there is a path, made by sheep and goats, and used by mountaineers, but from there one has to follow the ridge up to Dummhøe, which is more of a small plain than a mountain. The plain is followed up to the summit of Western Skarstind, but from that small summit you can see the difficult west wall of the main summit. There are four small walls to climb, but they may all be outflanked on the right side if the conditions are good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close distance it is not too difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with fresh snow, like the last picture, equipment will probably be necessary on all routes. Nåle seems to be very difficult, but it is much easier than the summit itself. Skarstind is quite popular, given the mountain's high rank among Norwegian peaks; on most days during the short summer season peakbaggers climb the mountain, but the summit is hardly ever crowded. A winter ascent is only for the very experienced."

  "text" : "Saddleback Mountain is a mountain located in Sandy River Plantation, Franklin County, Maine, near the resort town of Rangeley. Saddleback is one of the highest mountains in the State of Maine, and one of the fourteen with more than 2,000 ft (610 m) of topographic prominence. The mountain is the site of Saddleback ski resort. Saddleback is flanked to the northeast by Saddleback Horn. The mountain rock is primarily a form of granodiorite known as the Redington pluton that is estimated to have formed roughly 410 million years ago, while the soil atop it is largely till with a thickness of 10 feet (3.0 m) or less. The northwest side of Saddleback drains into Saddleback Lake, then into Redington Stream, the South Branch of the Dead River, the Kennebec River, and into the Gulf of Maine. The southeast side of Saddleback drains into Winship and Conant Streams, then Orbeton Stream, and the Sandy River, another tributary of the Kennebec. The southwest end of Saddleback drains into Cascade Stream, then into Rangeley Lake, Rangeley River, Mooselookmeguntic Lake, Upper and Lower Richardson Lakes, Rapid River, Umbagog Lake, and the Androscoggin River, which drains into Merrymeeting Bay, the estuary of the Kennebec River. The Appalachian Trail, a 2,170 mi (3,490 km) National Scenic Trail from Georgia to Maine, runs along the ridge of Saddleback, crossing the summit. Saddleback Maine, a ski area, is located on the north face of the mountain."

  "text" : "Snake Mountain, 1,287 feet (392 m), also called Grand View Mountain, is an isolated mountain located in Addison and Weybridge, Vermont; it belongs to a series of scattered hills extending from the greater Taconic Mountains geology. Snake Mountain contains the state of Vermont's 1,215-acre (492 ha) Snake Mountain Wildlife Management Area and The Nature Conservancy's Willmarth Woods Sanctuary. Several hiking trails ascend the mountain (one climbs the western face and the second climbs the eastern face). Seen from the west, the mountain rises dramatically (with its prominent sheer cliffs) out of the nearby valley making it easy to recognize from other nearby hills and mountains. The mountain was once the site of The Grand View Hotel, built in 1870 by Jonas N. Smith. The hotel burned down but its foundations and the open vista of Lake Champlain remain. Smith's stage coach road to the summit is now the primary hiking trail. In memory of the hotel, the view from the summit is named \"Grand View.\""

  "text" : "Smarts Mountain is a mountain located in Grafton County, New Hampshire. Smarts is flanked to the north by Mount Cube, at 2,909 feet (887 m), and to the southwest by Holts Ledge, at 2,110 feet (640 m). Although of only moderate elevation, Smarts is separated from the southwestern White Mountains by Oliverian Notch, a fairly low pass traversed by New Hampshire Route 25 southwest of Mount Moosilauke. That gives Smarts a relative height of 2,190 ft (670 m), which makes it one of twelve mountains in New Hampshire with a prominence over 2,000 ft (610 m). The northwest and south sides of the mountain drain by several brooks into the Connecticut River and thence south into Long Island Sound in Connecticut. The northeast side drains east into the South Branch of the Baker River, and thence via the Pemigewasset and Merrimack rivers into the Gulf of Maine in Massachusetts. Smarts Mountain is the southernmost significant mountain in New Hampshire on the Appalachian Trail, a 2,170-mile (3,500-km) National Scenic Trail from Georgia to Maine. Smarts is outside the White Mountain National Forest, but the trail runs through a narrow corridor along the ridges which is administered by the Forest Service. There was a Learjet plane crash on the mountain in 1996, as well as a Piper Apache twin crash in 1971."

In fact, the viticultural area extends in isolated patches up the eastern slopes of Sonoma Mountain to almost 1,700 feet (520 m) in elevation. The eastern and northern slopes are protected from afternoon heat and hence are more densely forested in oak woodlands, abetted by the well drained nutrient rich soils. The western and southern slopes, on the other hand, are drier and warmer, leading to fewer dense woodlands and more chaparral, grassland and oak savannah."

Stoney Squaw is the second smallest mountain adjacent to the townsite, taller only than Tunnel Mountain. It is much rounder than many of the other mountains nearby. Ernest Ingersoll wrote in his 1892 \"Canadian Guide Book\" that the mountain takes its name \"from the traditional story that some years ago a brave old Assiniboine woman sustained her husband, who lay sick for several months in their lodge at its base, by hunting upon its top and sides, where there are open glades which still form favourite spring feeding-places for the big-horn or mountain sheep. The name became official in 1922. The adjacent Cascade Mountain used to be referred to as Stoney Chief, though this name is now largely defunct."

  "text" : "Sumas Mountain is a mountain located in Whatcom County, Washington, 15 miles northeast of Bellingham and southwest of Vedder Mountain. Located in the Skagit Range the mountain is notable for its high biodiversity and year-round hiking trails. It is sometimes referred to as American Sumas to distinguish it from an identically named mountain just to the north in British Columbia. It is largely owned by the Washington Department of Natural Resources, but some parcels are privately held. While the public land is open for recreation, it is managed primarily for timber harvest. Clearcuts are present on many slopes and most all the remaining forest is in varying stages of recovery and regrowth. Washington State Route 547, which traverses a low pass on the mountain's northern flank, runs northwest from the Mount Baker Highway, (SR 542) in Kendall to SR 9 in Sumas, which is located on the Canada–United States border and south of Abbotsford, British Columbia. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad once traversed the same pass. The controversial Swift Creek Landslide is located on the mountain's western slope."

  "text" : "Smrk is a massif and a mountain in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids range in the Czech Republic. With a height of 1,276 m (4,186 ft) it is the second highest summit of the range after Lysá hora. Its Northern slope steeply rises from the surrounding lowlands and is separated from the rest of the mountains by the deep Ostravice River (in the East) and Čeladenka (in the West) river valleys; in the South it merges in the lower Zadní hory (i.e. Rear mountains) area. Although its name (it means spruce) suggests differently it was originally covered mainly in beech and fir forests, with a higher spruce share closer to the summit. During the industrial revolution in the region under the mountains in the 18th and 19th centuries when many ironworks were established, with a center in Frýdlant nad Ostravicí, there was a high demand for firewood and the original forests were felled out and replaced by secondary spruce plantations. These were heavily damaged by industrial fall-out from the Ostrava region also because non-natives pruce varieties, which were not well adapted to the local climate, were planted there. Thus everyone coming to Smrk from North will see a mountain stripped of trees in its upper parts. Other slopes were not so heavily damaged and are still forested in most places. Especially in the Čeladenka river valley there any many stretches of preserved or newly planted beech trees. There are limited views from the summit which is covered in most places by also secondary (non-native to the Moravian-Silesian Beskids) mountain pines. Next to the secondary summit of Malý Smrk (i.e. Little Spruce) there are a John Lennon and Jan Palach memorials. Smrk belongs to the Beskydy Landscape Protected Area (Czech: Chráněná krajinná oblast Beskydy). Its summit lies partly in the first (most protected) zone. Furthermore, there are Smrk and Malý Smrk Reserves (Czech: Přírodní rezervace Smrk and Czech: Přírodní rezervace Malý Smrk) in the best preserved and most valuable areas of both summits."

It is located in the Magdalena Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest, about 9 mi (15 km) south of Magdalena and 18 mi (30 km) west-southwest of Socorro. It lies just north of the Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and near the future site of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer. South Baldy can be accessed easily from the dirt road leading to Langmuir. Alternately, it can be accessed by trail from below. From a campground in Water Canyon (accessed from the northeast side of the range), a trail follows Forest Road 406 and then Trail 10 up Copper Canyon to the main crest of the range, where it joins Trail 8, the North Baldy Trail, which follows the crest. A short hike south on this trail and a little off-trail ascent leads to the summit of South Baldy. The peak is the site of an annual mountain bike ascent race up the Langmuir Road as part of the Tour of Socorro. While not of exceptional height for New Mexico mountains, South Baldy is surrounded by low terrain, and hence is a highly visible landmark and the sixth most topographically prominent peak in the state."

  "text" : "Suswa is a shield volcano in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya. It is located between Narok and Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. Suswa has a unique double crater with a moat-like inner crater surrounding a tilted block of rock. The mountain is also known for its lava tube caves on the northeast side of the outer crater. It is possible to drive up the lesser-end of the mountain into the outer crater with a four-wheel-drive vehicle; however, there are numerous barricades across the trail where local Masaai try to collect a fee for allowing you through. Arrangements can be made to pay a set fee and get a guide to take you past the barricades. The inner crater is home to a variety of snakes species. Other wildlife of interest found on or near Mt. Suswa includes zebras, giraffes, mongooses, turtles, hyenas and leopards. It is also possible to climb the mountain, which owns a 2,356-meter summit. There are no specified paths, but Suswa is best accessed from the mountain from the north and northeast. The Suswa Primary school, located at the base of the mountain, is another practical starting point. Also, there are many Masaai homesteads surrounding the base of the mountain; it is recommended to introduce yourself to the head of the family if your route crosses such. With the exception of Rauch's Trail, there are no designated pathways to the summit. However, the Masaai do graze cattle on the mountain's grasslands, making for the occasional route. The peak can be reached on foot by following Rauch's Trail, which begins approximately one-and-a-half kilometers from the summit, from the northeast. Rauch's Trail is marked with a wooden sign, overlooking the crater."

  "text" : "Swirl How is a fell in the English Lake District. It stands between Coniston and the Duddon Valley in the southern part of the District. The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins at Wrynose Pass and runs south for around 10 miles before petering out at Broughton in Furness on the Duddon Estuary. Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower fells to the south to a supplementary work The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. Swirl How being a significant high point of the Coniston Fells therefore qualifies as one of the 214 Wainwrights. Later guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes."

The slopes can be accessed via hiking trails emanating from Blue Rock Springs Park in the city of Vallejo. Cinnabar deposits were extracted from this location in the early 1900s at Hastings Mine and St. John's Mine. Both mines are classified as medium priority mine from the standpoint of environmental oversight for California inactive mines. The highest peak on Sulfur Springs Mountain stands at an elevation of 1,112 feet (339 m), and affords expansive views of the northern San Francisco Bay as well as the Napa River. The rock outcroppings which occur in the Sulphur Springs area are composed of basaltic lava; however, there are also serpentine outcrops, which soils are known to provide habitat for many rare and endangered species in Northern California."

It lies near the northern end of the range, about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Alamogordo and 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Socorro. To the east lies the Tularosa Basin, while to the west is the Jornada del Muerto. The peak is located within the White Sands Missile Range, and hence is closed to the public. However a road on the northwest side leads to the top, where there are radio towers and a heliport. About 20 miles (32 km) to the north lies the Trinity Site, where the first atomic bomb test occurred in 1945. Bighorn sheep, mule deer, and mountain lion are present in the area, which has retained much of its wilderness character outside of the few installations of the Missile Range. Like many of the San Andres Mountains, Salinas Peak is rugged, rising sharply 4,900 feet (1,500 m) out of the surrounding basins. This makes it one of New Mexico's largest peaks in terms of local relief. It is a northwest-tilted fault-block, with a steep southeastern escarpment. The peak juts out to the east by a few miles from the main ridge trend, leading to deeply incised canyons on the north and south sides of the peak. Only a small section of the northwestern side is moderately angled."

  "text" : "Signal Mountain is an isolated summit standing 7,720 feet (2,350 m) above sea level. The mountain is located in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The next closest higher summit is more than 10 miles (16 km) distant, and this isolation provides sweeping views of the Teton Range, much of the northern Jackson Hole area as well as the Snake River. Though located adjacent to the Tetons, Signal Mountain was not formed in the same manner or period. The mountain originally was formed by volcanic ashfall from one of the eruptions of the Yellowstone hotspot. The peak is also partially a glacial moraine formed by a receding glacier that came south out of the Yellowstone icecap. This same glacier also created neighboring Jackson Lake. Signal Mountain has a 5-mile (8.0 km) long road providing vehicular access to an observation area located just below the main summit. The Signal Mountain Trail is a hiking trail that goes from Signal Mountain Lodge to the summit and covers a distance of 6.8 miles (10.9 km). The trail splits mid-way for a portion of approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km), allowing hikers to take either a trail along the lower part of the ridge or south of the ridge past a series of small ponds. The trails then rejoin and steepen over the last mile to reach the secondary summit of the mountain, the Jackson Lake Overlook. The trail rises approximately 800 feet (240 m) from the lodge to the overlook, though on the ridge trail there is quite a bit of up and down that adds a few hundred feet to the cumulative elevation gain. The trail is a hiking only trail, mountain biking and horseback riding are not permitted by the park service. The road is a popular biking destination due to the difficult climb up and then (after turning around at the summit) continuous downhill experienced on a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) portion of the road."

The island also contains a waterfall that leads into the lake. A Chinese peace pagoda stands near the shore of the lake. The top of the hill is a quiet and peaceful open space with panoramic views of San Francisco although the view is slightly obscured by trees. In the center of the open area are the ruined foundations of the Sweeny Observatory, built in 1891 as a public viewpoint and destroyed by the 1906 earthquake. Paths are closed to vehicle traffic. The hill is a popular destination for joggers and dog-walkers, especially on the weekends. Local high school track and cross country teams are frequently seen practicing running up and around the hill for resistance training. \n* Downtown San Francisco from the hill \n* The pagoda on the shore of the Stow Lake"

  "text" : "Silers Bald is a mountain in the western Great Smoky Mountains, located in the Southeastern United States. Its proximity to Clingmans Dome and its location alongthe Appalachian Trail make it a popular hiking destination. Silers Bald is located on the crest of the Smokies with Thunderhead Mountain to the west and Clingmans Dome to the east. The Tennessee-North Carolina state line crosses the summit, with the mountain split evenly between Sevier County, Tennessee to the north and Swain County, North Carolina to the south. Silers Bald rises appx. 2,500 feet (760 m) above its northern base near Fish Camp Prong (of Little River), and appx. 3,000 feet (910 m) above its southern base near Forney Creek. While Silers Bald was a grassy bald for most of the 19th and early-20th centuries, it was probably a wooded peak before the arrival of European settlers. For this reason, the park service does not maintain the bald atop the mountain (the Great Smoky Mountains National Park currentlymaintains only two grassy balds— Gregory Bald and Andrews Bald). A narrow corridor forthe Appalachian Trail, which crosses the summit, is kept clear for thru-hikers. There is stilla small bald area at the summit, approximately 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter, where the AppalachianTrail makes a 90-degree turn. Several grassy meadows remain on the mountain's western slope."

  "text" : "Stob Coire Easain is a Scottish Munro mountain which reaches a height of 1115 metres (3658 feet), situated 18 kilometres east of Fort William. It stands on the western side of Loch Treig, along with its \"twin\", the Munro Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin (1105 metres). Collectively the pair are called \"The Easains\" or the \"Stob Corries\" and stand just one kilometre apart connected by a high col with an approximate height of 965 metres. The fine corrie of Coire Easain Beag lies in between the two mountains facing north west. Stob Coire Easain’s name translates from the Gaelic as “Peak of the Corrie of the Little Waterfall”. This mountain should not confused with another Stob Coire Easain, a Munro “Top” on the Munro Stob Coire an Laoigh The Easains stand in splendid isolation, hemmed in by valleys on three sides, giving Stob Coire Easain a substantial topographic prominence of 611 metres. The mountain is the highest point on a nine kilometre long ridge which runs the entire length of the western side of Loch Treig; the eastern side of this ridge drops very steeply to the waters of the loch. To the west of the mountain is the valley of the Allt na Lairig. A subsidiary ridge going north from the summit is initially steep and craggy as it descends to the head of Coire Laire. To the south of the summit the main ridge descends gently over Irlick Chaoile to the lonely country at the head of Loch Treig. All drainage from the mountain goes into the River Spean to find its way to the west coast of Scotland via Loch Linnhe. Because of their close proximity, the Easains are usually climbed together with the best starting point being at the hamlet of Fersit (NN350784) where there is room to park a number of cars on the verges. The north east ridge of Stob a’ Choire Mheadhoin is followed to the summit; it is then a steep descent and climb across the stony col to the summit of Stob Coire Easain. An alternative walk utilises the West Highland Line, with the walker starting at Corrour railway station and traversing round the head of Loch Treig to gain the main ridge of the Easains, which can then be crossed south to north finishing at Fersit. Stob Coire Easain’s height and isolation give good views with the vista west over the Grey Corries and the Aonachs towards Ben Nevis being especially fine."

The main peak is 1,668 metres (5,472 ft) tall and approximately 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the north, there is the neighboring 1,562-metre (5,125 ft) tall summit of Litjsnota. The south wall of Snota is 200 metres (660 ft) high and it was first climbed in 1994. The first winter ascent was in 1997. Below the wall is the small Snota glacier."

It consists of glassy, augite-phyric basaltic andesite in steep-sided, glassy, finely jointed domes and one small, flat-topped bluff. The finely jointed domes are similar to those of Ember Ridge. There are quench features at Slag Hill, which is suggesting that the volcanic activity was subglacial. Slag Hill was formed throughout the Pleistocene period, but its most recent volcanic activity produced a lava flow on its western lobe that shows no evidence of ice-contact volcanism. This indicates the lava flow was erupted less than 10,000 years ago after the last glacial period."

However, as a range highpoint in deeply incised terrain, it is the second most topographically prominent peak in the country, after Huascarán. Salcantay's proximity to Machu Picchu makes trekking around it an alternative to the oversubscribed Inca Trail; this is known as the Salkantay trek."

It is the highest summit in the Lillooet Ranges, which lie between the Lillooet and Fraser Rivers, south of the Gates Valley and Seton and Anderson Lakes. Skihist Mountain consists of a north-south aligned ridge. Kent Creek drains its northern slopes while Nesbitt Creek drains the south and west slopes. Both creeks feed the Stein River. On its eastern slopes, it is drained by North Kwoiek Creek, which originates at Skihist Lake, a small mountain lake located approximately three kilometers southesast of Skihist's summit. The peak is most easily climbed via its south slopes, from the North Kwoiek Creek drainage."

It lies in the Uttarkashi District of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, west of the Gangotri group of peaks. It comprises four separate peaks; Swargarohini I is the main peak, and is the subject of this article. While not particularly high by Himalayan standards, and not the highest in the Bandarpunch range, Swargarohini I is notable for its dramatic local relief. For example, its north face drops 2,000 metres (6,560 ft) in less than 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) of horizontal distance, and its south face achieves the same drop in less than 3 kilometres (1.9 mi). This makes it a steep and challenging climb. Swargarohini I has two summits, east and west. The east summit is given an elevation of 6,247 m (20,495 ft), slightly lower than the west summit. However the first ascensionists of the west summit claim that that summit is the higher of the two. This snow-clad peak along is the source of the Tons River and along with the Bandarpunch massif it acts as a divider between the Yamuna and the Bhagirathi Rivers."

It is often mistaken for Snowmass Mountain, the thirty-fourth highest mountain peak in the state, as well as for Hagerman Peak. Snowmass Peak is not really a peak but the lower end of Hagerman Peak's east ridge. Natural forced perspective causes the optical illusion that Snowmass Peak is higher than Hagerman Peak though it is actually 221 ft shorter than Hagerman's summit. This illusion combined with its striking rise behind Snowmass Lake justifies it being a named point on USGS topographical maps. It is located in the Elk Mountains, within the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness of the White River National Forest. It lies along the border between Pitkin and Gunnison counties, west of Aspen and southwest of the town of Snowmass Village."

  "text" : "Scolty Hill is a small hill south of the Deeside town, Banchory. Its best known feature is the 20m tall tower monument, built in 1840 as a memorial to General Burnett who fought alongside Wellington. The tower was restored in 1992 and a viewing platform added by the Rotary Club of Banchory-Ternan. It enjoys splendid views over Banchory, the Dee Valley and the Grampian Mountains, which surround the hill. This encourages thousands of visitors each year. It is popular for tourists, locals and mountain bikers. Part of the hill is owned by the Forestry Commission, the other part is owned by local landowner Ron Middleton. Recent forestry work has meant that many visitors are not allowed on some paths for safety purposes. However, once this is completed the Scolty Woodland Park Association plan on recreating some of the paths on the hill and local mountain bikers also plan on creating a downhill mountain bike track, similar to the one at Pitfichie."

Its name refers to its status as a sacred symbol -Shiva Linga. It was called \"Matterhorn Peak\" by early European visitors because of its similarity in appearance to that Alpine peak. While not of locally great elevation, it is a dramatic rock peak, and most visually striking peak seen from Gaumukh; that and the difficulty of the climb make it a famed prize for mountaineers."

The first ascent was made by Giovanni Gnifetti, a parish priest from Alagna Valsesia, together with J. Farinetti, C. Ferraris, C. Grober, J. and G. Giordiano and their porters on 9 August 1842. The highest hut in Europe, the Margherita Hut (named after Italy's Queen consort Margherita of Savoy) lies on the summit of the mountain. Work started in 1890, supported by the Italian crown, and Queen Margherita opened it in 1893. The new hut, a high-altitude Faraday Cage, is clad in sheet copper to shield against unwanted electrical fields."

This confusion dates back many years and the National Geodetic Survey bench mark placed in 1947 on the summit of Frenchman Mountain is designated \"Sunrise\". During World War II the U.S. Army maintained an airway beacon on the summit and as of 2007, remains of the tower could still be found."

The hill is situated in a particularly remote part of northern Cumbria (although the Northumberland border runs over the north top just 600m from the top). It is four miles from the nearest road, making any walk to the summit and back at least eight miles long. Despite not being especially high, in terms of distance from civilisation it is the remotest Marilyn in the whole of England."

  "text" : "Shillhope Law is a hill in the southern Cheviots, a range of hills in Northumberland, England. Shillhope Law is a relatively unremarkable member of this group; in common with its neighbours it has a small summit and steep, grassy sides falling to deeply incised valleys on either side. However, unlike its neighbours, the ridge connecting Shillhope Law to the higher dome of The Cheviot to the north is bisected by a low col at 343 m, giving it enough relative height to be a Marilyn. The narrow road that climbs up Coquetdale from Alwinton relieves Shillhope Law eases any access problems. On the other side of the valley lies the Otterburn Training Area and training (without live ammunition) can take place on the northern side of Shillhope Law. Shillhope Law can be easily climbed from the farms on its western side, Barrowburn and Shillmoor, although the ascent is steep and unremitting. These two climbs can be combined to give a circular walk of about 5 miles. The view is not very far-reaching in any direction because of a large number of hills and ridges of the same height or higher in all directions except south and south-east."

The Rauma River and the E136 highway lie 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the east in the valley. The Trollryggen peak is located about 700 metres (2,300 ft) to the south.

It lies 100 kilometres (60 mi) southeast of Zaysan Lake. Despite its low elevation, it is well separated from higher ranges in its area (the Saur-Tarbagatai System being separated from the Altai Mountains by the Irtysh River valley, and from the Dzungarian Alatau, by the Dzungarian Gate); it is therefore ranked highly by topographic prominence. No recorded ascents have come to light and it is potentially one of the most prominent unclimbed peaks."

  "text" : "The Schynige Platte (Scheinige Platte on the old Siegfried Map) is a high mountain area at the foot of the Gumihorn, located between Gsteigwiler and Gündlischwand in the Bernese Oberland. It lies at an altitude of about 2,000 metres (7,000 ft), at the western end of a prominent ridge of the Schwarzhorn range, which separates the valley of the Lütschine from Lake Brienz. It is notable for its hotel and, since 1893, its mountain railway, one of the highest in Switzerland. In good weather conditions the area offers spectacular views to many surrounding mountains, including the Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau, and others giants of the Bernese Alps. Also, the town of Interlaken and the two great lakes of Thun and Brienz are visible to the north, over 1,500 metres (5,000 ft) lower. The area is accessible via the Schynige Platte railway, which runs from Wilderswil, where connection is made with Bernese Oberland railway trains from Interlaken. The railway reaches a height of 1,967 metres (6,453 ft) at the terminus station, on the south-facing slopes of Geiss summit. Southwest of the station is a hotel and mountain restaurant, at a height of 1,983 metres (6,506 ft). Northeast of the station is the Schynige Platte alpine botanical garden, specialising in the display of, and research into, the high altitude flora of Switzerland. A number of short loop trails extend north from the train station, reaching several view points, all within one kilometre from each other. Directly above the station and hotel, and overlooking the valleys of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, is the Geiss summit (2,067 metres (6,781 ft)). Further north, and overlooking Interlaken and the two great lakes, are the Daube (2,076 metres (6,811 ft)) and Oberberghorn (2,069 metres (6,788 ft)) summits. The highest summit in the Schynige Platte area, between the Daube and Geiss summits, the tower-like Gumihorn peak (2,100 metres (6,900 ft)), cannot be reached by pedestrians. The Schynige Platte is also the starting point for the popular hiking trails to Loucherhorn, Faulhorn or First which is connected to Grindelwald by a gondola lift. Administratively, the area is shared between the municipalities of Gündlischwand and Gsteigwiler, the tripoint between the municipalities of Bönigen, Gündlischwand and Gsteigwiler being on the Daube summit. All the municipalities are in the canton of Bern. \n* Schynige Platte from the south, with the railway station at the left (western) end of the ridge, and the Oberberghorn and Loucherhorn to the right. \n* View from the Schynige Platte over the Bödeli and Interlaken, with the Thunersee to the left and the Brienzersee to the right. \n* View from the Schynige Platte up the Lütschine Valley, with the Wetterhorn, Mettenberg, Schreckhorn and Finsteraarhorn behind. \n* View from the Schynige Platte up the Lauterbrunnen Valley, with the Ebnefluh, Mittaghorn, Grosshorn and Breithorn behind."

A granitic ridge stretching from the Annapolis Basin to Mount Uniacke, it forms the southern edge of the Annapolis Valley and shelters the valley from the climate effects of the pelagic coast along the Atlantic Ocean. Together with North Mountain, the two ranges form the Annapolis Highlands region. In contrast to its northern counterpart, North Mountain, South Mountain rises gradually over dozens of kilometres from the Atlantic coast and descends sharply at its northern edge where it meets the Meguma strata to form the south wall of the valley. The South Mountain range is also known as the South Mountain Batholith, the largest body of granitoid rocks in the entire Appalachians and comprises both granite barrens and granite uplands. It is estimated to have developed during the late Devonian Age. The highest point on the ridge is at an unnamed point in Kings County, 26 kilometres southeast of Berwick near Lake George. The Goler clan lived on South Mountain and gained infamy throughout the province."

The ridge runs southwest northeast between Edwards Run (and its surrounding Parks Valley) and Dillons Run. Schaffenaker Mountain takes its name from the Schaffenaker family that settled in the immediate area. The Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) climbs Schaffenaker Mountain to the west of the town of Capon Bridge offering a bird's eye view of the community and of the Cacapon River. Until recently, the mountain had remained mostly undeveloped but its views and proximity to Capon Bridge have made it a prime location for real estate development by companies such as the North American Land Corporation."

  "text" : "Snowy Mountain is a mountain located in Hamilton County, New York. Initially known as 'Squaw Bonnet', its summit is the highest point in the county. While most maps show the elevation as 3899 feet, some suggest that more recent surveys have it as 3904 feet or even 3908 feet. The mountain is the highest in the Adirondack Mountains south of the 4,000 ft (1,200 m) High Peaks region. It is one of thirteen mountain in New York with more than 2,000 ft (610 m) of topographic prominence. Snowy Mountain is flanked to the northeast by Squaw Mountain (3239 feet), and to the southwest by Lewey Mountain (3742 feet). A subsidiary ridge comes off the summit to the east ending at unnamed 'Peak 3149' (3149 feet) which forms the head of a large bowl overlooking the Griffin Brook drainage. Snowy Mountain stands within the watershed of the Hudson River, which drains into New York Bay. The south end of the northwest side of Snowy Mountain drains into Little Squaw Brook, thence into the Cedar River, and the Hudson River. The north side of Snowy Mountain drains into Squaw Brook, thence into Indian Lake, Lake Abanakee, the Indian River, and the Hudson River. The northeast end of Snowy Mountain drains into Beaver Brook, thence into Indian Lake. The southeast slopes of Snowy Mountain drain into Indian Lake via Griffin Brook, Forks Brook, Willow Brook, and Falls Brook. It is the location of the recently restored Snowy Mountain Fire Observation Station, i.e. 'fire tower', listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. In 1909, after the disastrous forest fires of 1903 and 1908, New York State began erecting observation towers on strategically located peaks, such as Snowy Mountain, as part of a comprehensive forest fire suppression program for the Adirondack Mountains. That year a fifteen foot high log tower and a small log cabin were erected on the summit of Snowy Mountain. A telephone line was strung from the tower to Indian Lake village, a distance of 11 1/2 miles. Upon sighting smoke, the observer would call in the location of a suspected forest fire. With reports from observers on other nearby mountains, the exact location of the fire could be calculated by triangulation and fire suppression crews dispatched most expeditiously. In 1917, a steel tower 22 feet high replaced the log tower. In 1933, the steel tower was raised 33 feet so observers could see over the surrounding trees (one must assume that Verplanck Colvin and his men cleared the summit of most, if not all, trees in 1872 for triangulation sightings to distant peaks during the Adirondack Survey). In 1971, the Snowy Mountain fire tower was closed when NYS decided that it was unnecessary for protecting the Adirondack Park from forest fires (airplanes could do the job equally well). Several years later (it was there in 1986, but gone in 2006), the observer's cabin was removed. Due to its high elevation and the restored fire tower, Snowy Mountain is a popular hiking destination. While the trip is nearly an eight mile walk involving more than 2000 feet of elevation gain, many find its views well worth the effort. While the history of ascending this peak is surely incomplete, this much is known: The earliest known ascent is said to have been in 1771 by Archibald Campbell, a surveyor from Albany, NY. In that year, Joseph Totten and Stephen Crossfield were negotiating the purchase of a huge land tract from the Mohawk Nation (Six Nation Confederacy)for Edward and Ebenezer Jessup who had great influence with Sir William Johnson, NY Governor Dunmore and General Tryon. One can imagine that Campbell was dispatched to the area to find out something about what was being purchased. Verplanck Colvin and his crew climbed it on 4 August 1872 for the Adirondack Survey. Mills Blake, Colvin's assistant, and his crew climbed it again ten years later on 7 November 1882 to complete some triangulations, again for the Adirondack Survey. One might wonder about their itinerary for they were again on the summit on 9 and 10 November. Due to the four mile approach, it seems likely that the survey crew bivouacked on the summit at least for the last two days. There is some speculation that Colvin may have been among the group on the 9th. While technically not 'winter', some consider this to be the earliest known 'winter' ascent. Colvin made his second (perhaps 3rd) ascent of this peak on 22 June 1885 when he certainly bivouacked on the summit. It is not known when the hiking trail was built, but one can imagine that it may have existed before the fire tower in 1909. Rockclimbing at Snowy Mountain: In the mid-1990s, the peak was visited by Neal Knitel and Jonas Morelli who attempted a route on the left side of the summit cliff. They never returned to complete their route because \"it was too far and there was other stuff to do.\" In 2002, unbeknownst to each other, two parties began working climbing routes at Snowy Mountain: Karl Swisher and Sid Perkins, and Ed Palen and Bob Starinsky. By 2008, seven high quality routes had been put up. All are bolt-protected face climbing on highly featured rock. Part-way up the Griffin Brook drainage toward Peak 3149, lie the Snowy Mountain Boulders, a unique collection of boulders featuring the largest collection of huecos in the Adirondack Park. This unique bouldering area was initially noticed by Dave Buzzelli in 2003 while on the approach to the slides on Peak 3149 for skiing. Over 40 bouldering problems have been put up here since 2006."

The terrain is very rugged; a continuous walk along the ridgeline includes an overall elevation change of 3,700 ft (1,128 m). The Seven Sisters are traversed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and is part of the New England National Scenic Trail The Seven Sisters are the location of the Seven Sisters Trail Race every spring, a twelve-mile (19 km) \"out-and-back\" run that often leaves its runners bloody, bruised and exhausted. In response to a proposed suburban development on the Seven Sisters in the late 1990s, several non-profit groups and local governments worked together to block construction and acquire the ridgeline for the J.A. Skinner State Park. Coincidentally, the seven sisters are near two of the Seven Sisters Colleges."

  "text" : "San Benito Mountain is a mountain located in the Diablo Range of California. The highest point is at an elevation of 5,267 feet (1,605 m). The rock is composed of asbestos (chrysotile), an ultramafic rock. It weathers to produce serpentine soils with characteristically low levels of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, and high levels of magnesium and heavy metals including nickel and chromium. This means little vegetation grows in the area though there are some plants that only grow on such soils like the local endemic San Benito evening primrose. Some of the highest peaks are clad in a unique pine and incense cedar forest. There are two superfund sites in the area, both associated with the mining and processing of chrysotile asbestos. There are also mines producing gems and the minerals cinnabar, chromite, magnesite, and jadeite are also mined here. The Clear Creek Management Area which includes the San Benito Mountain Research Natural Area has been closed to visitors since 2008 because of the hazards to health of the asbestos. Prior to that it had been a popular site for the use of off-road vehicles."

One of the most direct routes of ascent starts at Sonora Pass, 2 miles (3.2 km) south as the crow flies. Starting at the trailhead of the PCT on Sonora Pass, it is about a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) hike with 1,000 feet (300 m) elevation gain to the top of a pass. From there, the easiest and most direct way is to turn Northwest and follow the ridge that will lead to the summit.

  "text" : "Sollipulli is an ice-filled volcanic caldera, which lies about 12 kilometres south of the small town of Melipeuco in the La Araucanía Region, Chile. Volcan Sollipulli lies northeast of Caburgua Lake and southeast of Llaima volcano; and there are views to at least seven active volcanoes from the summit rim. The volcano has evolved in close contact with glacial ice and has some typical subglacial volcanic features such as hyaloclastite breccia and pillow lava. It differs from many calderas in that Sollipulli appears to have collapsed in a non-explosive manner. The age of collapse is not yet known, but since the caldera formed, volcanic activity has continued along the surrounding ring faults which have produced lava flows and lava domes, increasing the elevation of the caldera wall. The caldera is 4 km in average diameter and according to ground penetrating radar measurements made in 1993 it contained a maximum ice thickness of at least 550 m, but perhaps as much as 650 m, at that time. The volcanic complex is located within the boundaries of the sector Hualalafquén of Villarrica National Reserve."

The peak rises precipitously from the south end of the Rupal Valley, soaring 5,584 metres (18,320 ft) above sea level and some 6,500 ft (1,980 m) above the valley floor. To its east stands Rupal Peak, to its west, the iceflows of Rupal Glacier. Despite its impressive height and unique pyramid shape, Shaigiri is greatly overshadowed by its giant neighbor to the north, 8,126-metre Nanga Parbat. Though the peak itself is seldom climbed, its northern base camp (11,989 ft/3,655 m) is a summer destination for travelers, mountaineers and local herdsmen. The peak is highly visible from most of the Rupal Valley. From Shaigiri's base one can see Nanga Parbat's Rupal Face and the eastern end of the Mazeno Wall. Shaigiri is accessible via the Astore Valley, which opens to the great Indus River south of Gilgit. Most treks to Shaigiri, the Mazeno Pass and Nanga Parbat's Rupal Face are staged from the remote village of Tarashing, which is reached by jeep from Astore. Astore can be reached by bus or jeep from Gilgit, a major town on the Karakorum Highway."

  "text" : "Southwest Hunter Mountain (Leavitt Peak) is a subpeak of Hunter Mountain, located in Greene County, New York. SW Hunter is considered one of the Catskills' High Peaks in its own right, because of its separation from the main summit, and its topographic prominence. Hunter Mountain is named after John Hunter, who also gave his name to the town of Hunter. Southwest Hunter is part of the Devil's Path range of the Catskill Mountains.SW Hunter is flanked to the northeast by the main summit of Hunter Mtn., and to the west faces West Kill Mountain across 800-ft-deep Diamond Notch. It is considered a bushwack, as there are no registered trails leading to its summit. There is, however, a herd path 0.1 miles (0.16 km) west of Devil's Acre Lean-to marked by a small rock cairn that leads to the summit canister, following the ridge for 3/4 mile and then turning uphill to the peak (note that this upward turn is easy to miss and is only marked by an arrow scratched onto a nearby rock). Southwest Hunter stands within the watershed of the Hudson River, which drains into New York Bay. The north side of SW Hunter drains into the headwaters of West Kill, thence into Schoharie Creek, the Mohawk River, and the Hudson River. The southeast slopes of SW Hunter drain into Myrtle Brook, thence into Stony Clove Creek, Esopus Creek, and the Hudson River. The southwest side of SW Hunter drains into Hollow Brook, thence into Stony Clove Creek. Hunter Mountain is contained within the Hunter Mountain Wild Forest of New York's Catskill State Park. This Mountain is unnamed in the GNIS database, there is an effort underway to get the peak named Leavitt Peak in honor Bill & Elinore Leavitt, two of the founders of the Catskill 3500 club."

The peaks were first sighted from the air by Lincoln Ellsworth on November 23, 1935, and mapped from photos taken on that flight by W.L.G. Joerg. Remapped from air photos taken by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947–48, by Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960. The name, given by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee, refers to the precipitous and abrupt way in which the peaks rise from the surrounding snowfields and is associated with other musical names in the vicinity."

The caldera is one of the largest of the few calderas in western Canada, measuring about 30 kilometres (19 mi) long (north-south) and 20 kilometres (12 mi) wide (east-west). Mount Silverthrone, an eroded lava dome on the caldera's northern flank that is 2,864 metres (9,396 ft) high may be the highest volcano in Canada. The main glaciers in the Silverthrone area are the Pashleth, Kingcome, Trudel, Klinaklini and Silverthrone glaciers. Most of the caldera lies in the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield, which is the largest icefield in the southern half of the Coast Mountains; it is one of the five icefields in southwestern British Columbia that thinned between the mid-1980s and 1999 due to global warming. Nearly half of the icefield is drained by the Klinaklini Glacier, which feeds the Klinaklini River. The Silverthrone Caldera is very remote and rarely visited or studied by geoscientists, such as volcanologists. It can be reached by helicopter or — with major difficulty — by hiking along one of the several river valleys extending from the British Columbia Coast or from the Interior Plateau."

  "text" : "The Scex Rouge (also spelled Sex Rouge; lit. \"red rock\"; 2,971 m) is a mountain of the Alps, overlooking Les Diablerets in the canton of Vaud. Along with the Oldenhorn to the east, it is one of the main peaks of the Diablerets, a huge ice-covered mountain near the western end of the Bernese Alps, straddling the border between the cantons of Vaud, Valais and Bern, and exceeding 3,000 metres above sea level. On its west side, the Scex Rouge is part of a nearly 2,000 metre-high amphitheatre of cliffs surrounding the Creux de Champ valley, south of Les Diablerets. On its southeast side, the Scex Rouge overlooks the Tsanfleuron Glacier, the largest in the massif. Administratively, the mountain is part of the municipality of Ormont-Dessus, which also includes Les Diablerets. The Scex Rouge is connected from the Col du Pillon (Vaud) by two aerial tramways operated by Glacier 3000. The first leads to the summit of the Tête aux Chamois (2,525 m), which can also be reached from Reusch and Oldenegg on the Bernese side. From the Tête aux Chamois, a second aerial tramway leads to near the summit of the Scex Rouge, or more precisely, a 2,965 metre-high subsidiary summit. The mountain station lies at an elevation of 2,940 metres and consists of a large building, designed by Mario Botta, including a panoramic restaurant. The true summit of the Scex Rouge can now be reached by a bridge connecting it with the subsidiary peak, which is in turn connected to the station by stairs. The 107 metre-long so-called \"suspension bridge\" (without towers!), called Peak Walk, was inaugurated in October 2014. The area is used for winter sports from October to May, with several ski lifts being located on the Tsanfleuron Glacier. In the summer season, several hiking trails cross the glacier between the Scex Rouge, the Quille du Diable and the Oldensattel, at the foot of the Oldenhorn. The Glacier 3000 company also operates a snow coach on the glacier. The Scex Rouge itself can be reached by experienced hikers from Reusch via the Oldensattel or from Derborence and the Sanetsch Pass via the Quille du Diable. Two other more difficult access are from Les Diablerets via the Col de Prapio and from the Col du Pillon via the Scex Rouge Glacier. The first connection to the Scex Rouge was inaugurated on July 1964, at the time of Expo64, the fifth Swiss national exhibition. It remains nowadays the highest mountain of the canton with public transport access."

It rises sharply over 600 feet (183 m) above the surrounding terrain. The mountain, which has an elevation of 2,305 feet (706 m) above sea level, is known for its barren sides and distinctive brown-gray color, and can be seen for miles. The mountain offers some of the best rock climbing in North Carolina, and the park's creeks and streams feature excellent brook trout fishing. Because the mountain is the best example of a monadnock in massive granite in North Carolina it was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1974."

Only since 2009 the mountain hosts the suspension bridge Salbitbrücke  in its western face, which makes it possible to do a hike around it without the use of climbing gear. Of course it is still an exposed path and most people will take along a safety equipment to pass the bridge and the following ridge. Such equipment can be hired at the nearby huts Voralphütte and Salbithütte of the Swiss Alpine Club."

  "text" : "Strawberry Peak (6,164 ft or 1,879 m) is a prominent peak in the San Gabriel Mountains of Los Angeles County, California. It is located about 10 miles (16 km) north of Pasadena, and 28 miles (45 km) from Los Angeles, along the Angeles Crest Highway. Strawberry Peak is the tallest of the front range peaks, being three feet higher than nearby San Gabriel Peak. Both can be widely seen from greater Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, and are popular with hikers. Other prominent nearby peaks include Josephine Peak and Mount Wilson. Strawberry Peak was named by mountaineers over a century ago, who felt the peak resembled an enormous upside-down strawberry. The peak can be ascended on the east side as a trail walk beginning near the Red Box Picnic Area, or from the west as a class 3 scramble from a trailhead near the entrance to the Switzer Picnic Site. The area was closed to the public as a result of the Station Fire. However, the last closure order expired on May 24, 2014. It is especially common to see Rattlesnakes in the area."

The peak offers expansive views into the northern Shenandoah Valley and the town of Strasburg, Virginia. Signal Knob was used by Signal Corps in the American Civil War by both the Union and Confederate armies. The Confederates occupied it from 1862 to 1864, and it was a key observation point for the Battle of Cedar Creek. On August 14, 1864, a group of Union troops won control of the peak by defeating a detachment of the 61st Georgia Volunteer Infantry. Remains of Civil War era fortifications can still be seen around the area. The Massanutten Trail, maintained by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, leads hikers and mountain bikers up to Signal Knob. There are many loop options of varying lengths which may be combined with the Tuscarora Trail. Trails in the Signal Knob area are known to be less crowded than Shenandoah National Park, to the east."

  "text" : "Sgurra Bhreac (alternative spelling 'Sgurra Breac'), sometimes referred to as the Big Rock, is a Canadian peak located in the East Bay Hills of Cape Breton Island, an extension of the Appalachian mountain chain in the province of Nova Scotia. Sgurra Bhreac is a prominent rock outcrop, rising 50 m (160 ft) from the northern edge of The Big Barren, between the Breac Brook and Glengarry Valleys, and is the highest elevation point on Cape Breton Island south of the Bras d'Or Lake. Sgurra Bhreac is a challenging but popular hiking/geocaching destination as the view from its summit is impressive. From here one can see Sydney, Glace Bay, the Bras d'Or Lake, the Mira River and most of the Mira area, Loch Lomond, the Atlantic Ocean, and many other lakes, ridges, valleys and bogs. Located 30 km (19 mi) west of Sydney, inland of the community of Big Pond and 1 km (0.62 mi) southwest of East of Rock Lake, the peak can be approached to within 1 km (0.62 mi) by back roads, either Glengarry Rd. (named \"Spring Road\" on older maps) to the south or a road (unnamed on current topographical maps) to the north passing through Rear Big Pond, which follows the Breac Brook Valley. The final approach to the peak is by hiking. There is a fourth order Natural Resources Canada Geodetic Survey Division Station (Unique Number: 21139) on the summit, consisting of three markers. Two are brass/bronze disks and one is a copper survey bolt. This station was established sometime before 1921. The name, Sgurra Bhreac, (pronunciation approximately \"skoor ah brec\") which means spotted or pitted ridge or rock in Gaelic, was officially adopted on 2 December 1924. The Sgurra Breac, a local history / natural sciences newsletter published from 2004 to 2010, had adopted the name of the \"Big Rock\"."

  "text" : "Saka Haphong (also Mowdok Mual or Tlan Moy) is a peak in Bangladesh, often considered the highest point of the country, with an elevation of 1,052 metres (3,451 ft). Located on the Bangladesh–Burma border, it is situated between Thanchi, Bandarban, Bangladesh and the Chin State of Burma. Saka Haphong is not officially the highest peak of Bangladesh, but maps and other data indicate there are no higher peaks within the country. In February 2006 a GPS reading of 1,064 metres was recorded on this summit by English adventurer Ginge Fullen. The location he recorded, 21°47′11″N 92°36′36″E / 21.78639°N 92.61°E, accurately matches the location given by Russian topographic mapping and SRTM data, although these sources show its height to be slightly lower, at 1,052 metres. Recently two trekking clubs counted the height of Saka Haphong as 3,488 and 3,461 feet respectively. Any of these figures would make it the highest mountain in Bangladesh, exceeding the height of Keokradong which is 3,172 feet high."

  "text" : "Slivnica (pronounced [ˈsliːu̯nitsa]; 1,114 metres or 3,655 feet) is a peak in the Dinaric Alps in Slovenia, southeast of Cerknica on the edge of the plain defined by Lake Cerknica. Its southern and western slopes are covered in deciduous and pine forests, which also obstruct the view from the highest peak, Big Slivnica (Slovene: Velika Slivnica). A karst cave below the summit of Slivnica, known as Witches' Cave (Coprniška jama) was described by Valvasor in his The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola (1689) as a hole where storms were made. Warm air rises from the cave in the cold winter months and condenses to form mist, a phenomenon that contributed to the creation of the local legend about the Slivnica witches, traditionally blamed for all misfortune by local farmers from hail storms to various ailments."

Connected to the main peak by the roughly 7,000-foot (2,100 m)-high Jagged Ridge, Seahpo Peak stands to the north at the headwaters of a headstream of Sulphide Creek, a tributary of the Baker River. Several waterfalls tumble off its flanks, including Seahpo Peak Falls and Cloudcap Falls. (Seahpo Peak is sometimes referred to as Cloudcap Peak.) The mountain is also on the south side of the Nooksack Cirque, which forms the headwaters of the Nooksack River. It is bordered by the East Nooksack Glacier to the north and a few smaller unnamed glaciers to the south. It is also connected to Icy Peak by another unnamed ridge. The mountain derives its name from a French word, chapeau, meaning \"hat\"."

From the summit of Slide Mountain, Lake Tahoe, Washoe Lake, Carson Valley, and the city of Reno can be viewed. Slide Mountain dominates the Reno skyline, standing 5,000 feet (1,500 m) above the city just to the south of its larger neighbor Mount Rose. Several ski trails and a maintenance road lead to the summit, making the hike to the top an easy one, especially from the Mount Rose Summit Campground located on State Route 431 at the Northwest base. Many communications towers adorn the summit, providing television, radio, emergency responder and amateur communications service to the Reno, Carson City and Lake Tahoe areas."

With an altitude of 1600 metres above sea level, it contains diversified flora and fauna. The hill has 18 hairpin bends. On the 18th bend is a church and a view point of Dindigul city and the \"Dindigul Rock Fort\". The hill contains a small waterfall as well. The famous Sirumalai banana is slowly disappearing from disease, which scientists have been unable to prevent. Man-made fires on the hills have destroyed medicinal plants and threatened the fauna habitat. Fires are often set to promote vegetation growth used for animal fodder, clear land for cultivation, or improve access to timber."

The ridge is known for its abundance of amethyst, opal and petrified wood. It was referred to as Specimen Mountain by local miners and was probably named by prospectors well before 1870. The south side of the ridge is traversed by the 18.8-mile (30.3 km) Specimen Ridge Trail between Tower Junction and Soda Butte Creek. The trail passes through the Petrified Forest and over the summit of Amethyst Mountain el. 9,614 feet (2,930 m)."

The earlier volcanism is Oligocene in age, and consists of largely intermediate composition lavas and breccias. A few ash flow tuffs also constitute this phase of volcanism. It probably was related to subduction along the western margin of North America. The later volcanism is Miocene–Pliocene in age, and is basaltic in composition. It is best interpreted as a partial melt of the lower crust that was erupted onto the surface."

A panoramic terrace just below the summit, and directly on the Italian side of the border, provides a spectacular view especially to the west, over Lake Lugano and the city of Lugano, to the Alps. For this reason, the site is often known as the Balcone d'Italia. The eastern, Italian, slopes are relatively gentle, and the viewing terrace can be reached by road from the Italian commune of Lanzo d’Intelvi to the east. The slopes to the west down to Lake Lugano are much steeper, and the upper slopes are within the Swiss municipality of Arogno. However, the lakeside below the mountain is occupied by the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia. In 1969 it was planned to construct a cable car from Sighignola, across the Swiss upper slopes, to Campione d'Italia. Whilst construction was started, the cable car never opened, and in 2009 an agreement was reached between the Italian and Swiss authorities to remove the remains of the cable car structure."

The Schliffkopf lies on the Black Forest High Road in the National Park and is the site of an epoymous four star \"wellness\" hotel. Various long distance paths, including the West Way, run over the Schliffkopf. At the end of June 2003 a nature trail, the Lothar Path (Lotharpfad), was opened at the Schliffkopf on the topic of storm damage. Along an 800-metre-long educational and experience trail, visitors can see how this ten-hectare-area, heavily damaged by Hurricane Lothar in 1999, has gradually recovered and been recolonized. The Lothar Path runs along footbridges, ladders and steps and shows how the forces of nature act, how nature deals with destruction in such an area and what naturally regrows. The Schliffkopf is a source region for the Acher and the Murg."

The mountain ridge, the upper area of which is formed of bunter sandstone, belongs to the natural region known as Grindenschwarzwald and Enzhöhen. The Black Forest High Road (B 500) runs along its western flank and, below the eastern mountainside, is a tarn, the Wildsee. The West Way runs over the mountain leading to Ruhestein, 1.5 kilometres to the southwest. The Seekopf lies within the Black Forest National Park, established in 2014. On the summit plateau is the grave of Julius Euting, a well-known orientalist and co-founder of the Vosges Club."

  "text" : "Schanzenkopf (Spessart) is a wooded hill of Bavaria, Germany. It lies in the Mittelgebirge Spessart in the district of Aschaffenburg. Schanzenkopf has a maximum elevation of 343 metres. It is located in the municipal territory of Alzenau and is part of the ridge Hahnenkamm, the highest elevation of which lies just to the northeast of Schanzenkopf. There is another hill named Schanzenkopf (also known as Schwedenschanze) not far to the northeast, on the other side of the Kahl. The remains of a hill fort have been discovered on Schanzenkopf (Schanze is German for fieldwork or rampart). However, it is unclear whether this dates from prehistoric or medieval times."

  "text" : "Sodenberg is a 481 m high basalt cone (German: basaltkegel), the remnant of an extinct volcanic crater, located in the Franconian Saale (German: Fränkische Saale), in the Bavarian region of Lower Franconia (German: Unterfranken). From its heights it offers a panoramic view of the region extending from the ranges of the High Rhön to the Kreuzberg, as far as the Hassberge and the Steigerwald in the east, and the Spessart in the southwest. A local Franconian tradition tells of Noah's Ark finally coming to rest on the slopes of Sodenberg. The fact that the names of many towns and villages in the surrounding area contain the names of animals within them, such as Ochenthal (oxen), Morlesau (sow), Schweinfurt (pig), Hammelburg (sheep), Wolfsmünster (wolf), Fuchsstadt (fox), Hundsfeld (dog), Katzenbach (cat), Rossmühle (horse), Wittershausen (ram), Hassenbach (hare), Motten (moths), Schnackenwert (mosquitoes) and Geiersnest (vultures), may very well have had something to do with the origin of this somewhat fanciful version of the famous biblical story."

  "text" : "The Sonntagshorn, at 1,961 metres above sea level, is the highest mountain in the Chiemgau Alps. The international border between Germany and Austria, and hence between the states of Bavaria and Salzburg, runs over the summit of the mountain, which rises south-southeast of Ruhpolding and south-southwest of Inzell. The name Sonntagshorn has nothing to do with the Sonntag (German for \"Sunday\"), but is derived from Sonnendach, which means \"sun roof\".The summit structure looks like a roof from the southern side which, as a result of its relatively gentle slope, is very strongly irradiated by the sun. Because the mountain has no cable cars it is a worthwhile destination which, in winter, is especially popular with ski tourists in the Bavarian Alps. A comparatively easy climb approaches from the south via the Austrian valley of Heutal. The northern climb from the German side is more challenging, but also more spectacular and runs through unpopulated natural countryside, initially along a relatively easy forest track, but then over steep fields of scree and, into the high summer, also over fields of old snow. The climb via the middle Kraxenbach requires some climbing (grade II) and has the danger of falling rocks. The normal route runs from Melleck and through the Steinbachgraben to the Hochalmen and finally to the summit."

  "text" : "The Stadelhorn (2,286 m) is the highest and most prominent peak in the Reiter Alm on the Austro-German border, lying on the boundary between the states of Bavaria and Salzburg. The Stadelhorn is a popular, but rather exposed hiking summit.The view from the top extends from the Untersberg, the Hochkalter and Watzmann over the Leoganger Steinberge and Loferer Steinberge to the Sonntagshorn as well as large parts of the Lower Saalach valley. In addition, on clear days, the Stadelhorn offers a view from the Großer Priel in the east over the Dachstein and the High Tauern - including the Großglockner and Großvenediger - to Germany's highest peak, the Zugspitze, in the west.At the foot of the Stadelhorn on the Austrian side are the villages of St. Martin b. Lofer, Lofer and the parish of Unken; on the Bavarian side is the Klausbach valley and the Hintersee lake. The normal route to the top of the Stadelhorn runs along the western arête (Westgrat) beginning at the Mayrberg gap (Mayrbergscharte, 2055 m). From here there are various options: Direct climbs: \n*  along the Loferer Steig (path) from the Austrian side. \n*  along the Schaflsteig (path) from the Bavarian side (Engert Alm). Ascents via the Roßkar gap (Roßkarscharte) and the upper Wagendrischel cirque (Wagendrischelkar): \n*  from the Neue Traunsteiner Hut along the Roßgasse or the Steinberggasse. \n*  From the lake of Hintersee along the Böselsteig (path) Unlike its eastern neighbour, the Großes Mühlsturzhorn, the Stadelhorn has fewer climbing options, although an ascent does require a head for heights and sure-footedness. Only a sports climbing tour up the southwest face is used more often."

First settlements date from the neolithic Stone Age. Romans, Celts and Franconians followed. During the La Tène period the Celtic oppidum of Menosgada was built on the plateau of the Staffelberg. Nowadays, it is a famous tourist attraction - not only because of the great view over the Main valley. The Staffelberg is located next to Vierzehnheiligen and the district capital of Lichtenfels. At the foot of the hill is the town of Bad Staffelstein. The Staffelberg is suited for hiking, mountain biking or climbing. On the top of the mountain there is a little church and a restaurant. The entire hill is protected by environmental laws."

Territories on all sides are disputed. The land immediately to the southwest of the peak is claimed by both Pakistan and India and controlled by Pakistan. The land to the northeast is part of the Trans Karakoram Tract, controlled by China under a 1963 border agreement with Pakistan but claimed by India. The land to the southeast is claimed by Pakistan and India, but controlled by India, as a part of its Siachen glacier territory.It is the 63rd highest mountain in the world, and the 25th highest in Pakistan. The peak is on the watershed between the Indus River basin and the Tarim Basin. Indira Col is 3 km to the east. Sia Kangri (24,350 ft) is India’s northernmost point. Sia Kangri was first climbed in 1934 by the International Himalaya Expedition led by the Swiss/German Günther Dyhrenfurth. The summit party included Hettie Dyhrenfurth, who thereby set the women's world altitude record, which stood for 20 years."

The troll hated people walking on his mountain, disturbing his rest, so he used to lie on top of the mountain to scare them away. If someone came too close, he threw rocks and boulders at them. If you walk the path to Sørmyrseter, you can still see some of them. The troll was careful only to be outside when it was cloudy, but once he was surprised by the sun and turned to stone. You can still clearly see its nose, mouth and chin if you look from the right angle, which is where the mountain has its name from; the ugly man."

  "text" : "Sawnee Mountain is a low mountain between the piedmont and Appalachian foothills of the U.S. state of Georgia, north of Atlanta. The name Sawnee Mountain actually refers to the entire ridge of approximately five miles (8 km) in length. At its summit, the elevation is 1,946 feet (593 m) above mean sea level, and is roughly 750 feet (230 m) above the surrounding terrain. The Sawnee Mountain range runs southwest to northeast, and consists of five knolls and three gaps (Chamblee, Sawnee, and Bettes). Located only a few miles north of Cumming, Georgia (the county seat), the mountain is easily the highest point in Forsyth county. One of the highest peaks of metro Atlanta, it nudges out its prominently known neighbors Stone Mountain and Kennesaw Mountain by a hundred or so feet each. However, Sawnee is in the far northern exurbs, putting it in third place behind Bear Mountain and Pine Log Mountain to the west."

In the cirques and high alpine meadows (Hochalmen) of its eastern slopes and the two neighbouring peaks of Fünfmandling (2,401 m) and Schwebenkopf (2,354 m) are the headstreams of the Salzach, the largest river north of the Salzburg Central Alps. The Salzachgeier has a double summit where five sharp ridges run together. The eastern summit is only three metres lower and towers immediately above the two aforementioned source regions (the Salzachboden and Schwebenalm). Whilst the southern slopes of the three peaks descend towards the Gerlos Pass, the watershed to the north (the Salzachjoch 1,983 m) is only a kilometre from the eastern cirques. Here on the state border, high over the Roßwildalm, is a mountain chapel, the Markkirchl (St. Mark's Chapel) and somewhat lower down is the New Bamberg Hut run by the German Alpine Club (DAV). To the west the slopes are just as steep, but less rocky, and drain into the Frommbach stream in the direction of Kitzbühel. The Salzachgeier is part of the touring area for the Bamberg Hut and is a popular ski tour in winter."

  "text" : "Sherkala (Kazakh: Шерқала, Şerqala, شەرقالا) is a mountain in Mangystau Province, western Kazakhstan, close to the town of Shetpe (Шетпе, Şetpe, شەتپە). It has been described as looking like a piala, yurt or Sphinx with steep south and east sides and a more eroded northern side. The mountain is sited between the central and western Karatau Mountains. Remains of a medieval caravanserei and fort belonging to Dzhuchi, Genghis Khan's elder son are on top and at the foot of the mountain. A tunnel can be used to access the summit. The ruins of the medieval settlement of Kyzylkala and of Mankashlak (Mankyshlak), a Turkmen town on the Silk Road, are also nearby as is Torysh (The Valley of Balls). The mountain was, according to legend, besieged by the Sheikh of Khoresm Astsyz after he had conquered Mankashlak. After four months the attackers dug a tunnel sideways through the mountain into the well shaft of the town above, cutting off their rope and forcing their surrender. The name Sherkala is from Persian شیرقلعه and means 'Lion's Mountain'."

  "text" : "Serra Calderona (Valencian pronunciation: [ˈsɛra kaɫdeˈɾona], Spanish: Sierra Calderona), often referred to as La Calderona is a 49 km (30 mi) long mountain range in the Camp de Túria, Horta Nord and Alt Palància comarcas of the Valencian Community, between the provinces of Castelló and Valencia Spain. This moderately high range is an eastern prolongation of the Sierra de Javalambre. Its highest point is El Gorgo (907 m). Other important summits are Muntanya del Garbí (600 m) and El Puntal de l' Abella (635 m). The range was formerly known as Monts de Porta Coeli, after the Carthusian Monastery of Porta Coeli located in the mountains. The name Calderona originated in the seventeenth century when a woman known as María Calderón \"La Calderona\", one of the favourite mistresses of King Philip IV of Spain, hid in these mountains among the highwaymen."

The Sandstone Peak Trail, which leads to the top, connects to a vast trail system in the area, including the Backbone Trail. The mountain is highly popular with climbers, hikers, campers, and photographers. The Boy Scouts of America petitioned the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to name the mountain for W. Herbert Allen who had donated land for nearby Camp Circle X and other Boy Scout camps. He served as president of the Los Angeles Area Council. The board denied the request because of a long-standing policy not to approve a geographic name in commemoration of a living person. The land is now known as the Circle X Ranch, a park unit located in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area."

And there is an informal trail up the bottom East nose of the massif right across the intersection from the Scheuren Viewpoint. This latter trail passes around a water tower and eventually joins the main trails near the top. Vegetation is sparse on the peak; dwarf forest and chaparral on the approaches, scrub and grassy at the top. Some oaks at lower elevations. The true summit is the South Eastern hummock, much degraded. Views from here are of the Pacific Ocean to the West, and other ridges and peaks of the Santa Monica Mountains to the East and West. There is a second summit reached by private road, to the Northwest, with a wire-fenced compound of numerous radio relay towers. At the far end beyond the compound is a house site foundation in disrepair. This slope burned in 1989. Beyond and below that is a private road back down to Stunt Road, with private residences below. There are occasionally rattlesnakes on the SMMC trail."

Situated between the valley of the River Melaja Tartagine and the valley of Fiumi di Regino, the mountain rises to 1,680 metres (5,510 ft). San Parteo straddles the communes of Pioggiola and Feliceto. It is part of a mountain range that marks both the entire northwestern part of the Regional Natural Park of Corsica and the western part of Giunssani. This chain includes some remarkable peaks, mainly Capu Ladroncellu (2145 m), Monte Corona (2144 meters), the Capu a u Dente (2025 meters), Punta Radich (2012 m), Monte Grosso (1937 meters) and San Parteo, and form a large part of the casket of Giunssani. Until 1935, an Easter Monday procession took place in a chapel, now in ruins, situated at 1600 meters altitude in the San Parteo. The chapel was dedicated to Saint Parthée (San Parteu), a fifth-century saint who was very popular in the Giunssani. Although not the highest, the San Parteo is not easily accessible. Some take a path from Feliceto, but this route has become notorious because of large landslides. An unmarked mountain path is said to \"scale the east flank of the cirque and follows the ridge to the summit, from where you follow the spine of another ridge west to rejoin the waymarked trail to Mausoleo.\""

It consists of a group of Quaternary volcanic cones that are mainly rhyolitic in composition. The volcanism is curved, suggesting that the volcano has an ancient caldera. The centre of the volcano is Lou Island. Lou island last erupted in 240 BC (give or take 100 years) and 340 AD, both eruptions came from the Bendal volcano. Lou island is the largest eruptive centre of the volcano, with 6 volcanic vents. Also the Pam islands (Pam Lin and Pam Mandian) also contain fresh deposits. Historic eruptions have come from the Tuluman Islands."

Smoky Dome rises about 5,000 feet (1,500 m) over the Camas Prairie and is the 21st most prominent peak in Idaho. Views from the summit encompass the Pioneer, Smoky, and Trinity Mountains as well as the Bennett Hills. The primary route to Smoky Dome begins just north of the Soldier Mountain Ski Area and heads west up and old dirt road that is now trail 087. The route then turns onto trail 185 as it crosses the South Fork of Soldier Creek. Once on the ridge above the ski area, follow the trail along the ridge until it ends below and to the northeast of the second peak. Continue to follow the ridge up the second and third peaks until you reach Smoky Dome. There are numerous other routes possible. The northern slopes of Smoky Dome are drained by Boardman Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Boise River. The four Smoky Dome Lakes, Lower, Upper 1, Upper 2, and West Smoky Dome Lakes are northwest of the peak. Boardman Peak and Iron Mountain are both northwest of Smoky Dome."

  "text" : "Sumantri (also spelled Soemantri or Soemantri Brodjonegoro) is a sharp mountain in the western Sudirman Range (New Guinea), it rises 4,870 metres (15,978 ft). The peak is approximately 2 km northeast of Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m), the highest mountain of Oceania. The north side of Sumantri is dominated by tremendous cliffs, part of the Noordwand (North wall) of the Carstensz Massif, that wrap around onto both the eastern and western sides of the mountain. Remnants of the once mighty North Wall Firn still cling tenuously to the southern aspects of the peak. It is unlikely that this ice will last for more than the next fifteen years."

  "text" : "The Samalayuca Dune Fields, more traditionally known as Los Medanos (the dunes), or more recently referenced as Medanos de Samalayuca are a series of large but separated fields of sand dunes located in the northern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The dune fields are scattered over a wide expanse of desert to the south, southwest and southeast of Ciudad Juarez. The dune fields are located in a 2000 km2 area known as the Samalayuca Desert. The Samalayuca Desert and its dune fields are part of the much larger Chihuahua Desert region. The best known portion of the Samalayuca Dune Fields lie in and around the village of Samalayuca. These dune fields are the most noticeable because they lie across the much traveled north-south route between Chihuahua City and El Paso del Norte. This portion of the dunes is also the most dramatic, having high dune profiles shaped by the wind in the lee of Cerro de Samalayuca. The dunes are composed of almost pure quartz (SiO2). They are white or tan in appearance. They are fine and move with the wind. The wind has formed the dunes by carrying sand until it became deposited and concentrated in natural land depressions. The action of the wind continues to constantly reshape the dunes. Some of the dunes near Samalayuca are tall and dramatically shaped and marked by the wind. For centuries the sands of these dune fields were historically significant because they lay across the much traveled north-south route between Chihuahua City and \"The Pass of the North\" at the site of the border cities of Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. Before the era of the modern highway and the railroad, travel by foot, horse or oxen across this extended barrier of some 30 kilometers of loose sand was laborious and dangerous, but travelers had the option of a longer (and thus more time consuming) detour around the east side of the dune fields. Today the dune fields are becoming known for their tourist and recreational potential, and as a habitat for the many unique endemic species of plants and animals living in a rare ecosystem in the Samalayuca desert. The high silica content of the sands has also attracted industrial interest."

They are situated on the banks of the Shetrunji River at an elevation 164 feet (50 m) above sea level. These hills have similarities to other hills where Jain temples have been built in Bihar, Gwalior, Mount Abu and Girnar. The Jain's sacred site of Shatrunjaya contains hundreds of Palitana temples. The hills were sanctified when Rishabha, the first tirthankara of Jainism, gave his first sermon in the temple on the hill top. The ancient history of the hills is also traced to Pundarika Swami, a chief Ganadhara and grandson of Rishabha, who attained salvation here. His shrine located opposite to the main Adinath temple, built by his son Bharata, is also worshiped by pilgrims. There are several alternate spellings, including Śatruñjaya, Satrunjaya, Shetrunja, and Shetrunjo. Shatrunjaya was also known as Pundarikgiri as Pundarik was said to have attained nirvana on this mountain. Alternate names include Siddhakshetra or Siddhanchal as many thirtankaras are stated to have received enlightenment here."

The mountain rises in the Italian province of South Tyrol in the Rieserferner-Ahrn Nature Park (Parco Naturale Vedrette di Ries-Aurina). It was first climbed on 6 October 1866 by Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria, Count Heinrich Wurmbrand, and mountain guides, Georg Auer, Johann Oberarrbacher from Rein in Taufers and Georg Weiss, an innkeeper from St. Johann im Reintal. Today the Schneebige Nock may be reached from the Kasseler Hut (also Hochgall Hut) to the northeast or from the Rieserferner Hut to the south. Thanks to its prominent pyramidal shape and its distinct arêtes it is a frequently visited viewing summit."

The area is in the Cucamonga Wilderness in the San Bernardino National Forest, 1.24 miles south of Bonita Falls on South Fork Lytle Creek and north of Rancho Cucamonga, California. It has an elevation of 1,690 meters, or 5,545 feet. Before the flat acquired its current name it was the hideout of the outlaw Tom McCauley better known as James or Jim Henry of the Mason Henry Gang. When the American Civil War ended in April with Lee's surrender at Appomattox the gang with a price on their heads, came under pressure from the Union Army and law enforcement officials in Central California. They moved into pro secessionist Southern California and split up. Henry with part of the gang moved into the eastern San Gabriel Mountains at San Sevaine Flats from which they began rustling, committing robbery and murder as they did. Henry was killed by a posse led by San Bernardino County Sheriff Benjamin Franklin Mathews on September 14, 1865, at San Jacinto Canyon in what is now Riverside County, California. The flat was named (but misspelled) for Pierre Sainsevain, who with his brother bought part of Rancho Cucamonga in 1865 and set out a large vineyard. He moved to Cucamonga in 1870 and ran the vineyard and winery with Joseph S. Garcia. In 1874 the Sainsevain brothers purchased land in Hawker Canyon four miles east of Etiwanda and built a large stone house and a reservoir there."

The layers are separated by an unconformity and provide an unobstructed view of this type of geologic phenomenon. Sheep Rock is named for the Bighorn Sheep that used to inhabit the area. To the north is part of Red Ledge Mine in Deep Creek. The National Forest maintains a mile long interpretive trail that leads to the canyon overlook halfway around the loop.

The peak name was given by Sierra Club Lower Peaks Committee Guide, originally named by Ken Croker who for 20 years maintained trails in the Santa Ana Mountains with volunteers from the Sierra Club. It remains officially nameless despite being the highest summit in the Elsinore Mountains, higher than Elsinore Peak, at 3536 ft., the highest named peak in those mountains. San Mateo Creek has its source at an elevation of 2800 feet, in the canyon on the western face of this peak. A fork of Morrell Canyon Creek, a tributary of San Juan Creek, has its source on the northeast face of this peak as do several arroyos descending to the west from the peak into that same creek. An unnamed arroyo, also tributary to San Mateo Creek has its source on the southwest face of ridge descending to the south from this peak."

Seaborough Hill rises immediately north of the village of Seaborough and about 3 kilometres southwest of the town centre of Crewkerne. A minor road traverses the summit from north to south and there is a trig point (201 m) by the lane at the northern end of the summit ridge, near Honeydown Farm. There are scattered woods on the western and eastern flanks of the hill. The River Axe runs past the hill to the south and two major trails - Liberty Trail and Monarch's Way bypass it to the north and south respectively. The county boundary runs along the ridgeline before swinging around the northern spur of the hill and heading away to the southeast."

Its prominence of 53 metres qualifies it as one of the county's Tumps. Selborne Hill lies above the village of Selborne on the edge of the Hampshire Downs, its crown playing host to Selborne Common, an area of woodland and relict wood-pasture. Its summit and steep escarpment are covered by woods, with Selborne Hanger to the northeast dropping abruptly to the fields above Selborne. The Zig-Zag Path runs down the spur towards the east. This is the area where the world famous naturalist and pioneer of birdwatching, Rev. Gilbert White, wrote his celebrated Natural History of Selborne."

The summit is easily accessible by a trail on the northern side. The peak is named for the extended alpine pasture Selunalp to the peak's north-west, situated above c. 1700 m. The name's etymology is uncertain, possibly from a *sellonem (Latin sella) \"saddle\".Named for Selunalp is Johannes Seluner (c. 1828–1898) who was found in 1844 as a feral child living in Wildenmannlisloch cave."

Stowe's Hill is a prominent granite ridge located about 1500 metres north of Minions, the highest village in Cornwall. It is dominated by Stowe's Pound, a huge tor enclosure comprising two massive stone-walls. The smaller enclosure surrounds the tors at the southern end of the hill; the larger one encircles the rest of the ridge. At the southern end is a large, disused quarry, but the hill is best known as the site of the Cheesewring, the extraordinary granite formation that gave the quarry its name. Inside Stowe's Pound are two Bronze Age cairns, a stone round house and over 100 house platforms. The site is thought to be Neolithic or Bronze Age and connected with other settlements and ritual monuments in the vicinity."

The Spanish priest Cristobal de Albornoz noted in 1583 that Sara Sara was one of the most important sacred places in the southern part of Peru, with 2,000 colonists sent by the Inca emperor for its service. The American archaeologist Johan Reinhard surveyed a site on its summit in 1983 and he and Peruvian archaeologist Jose Antonio Chavez led a team that uncovered more than a dozen statues and a female Inca mummy (later nicknamed Sarita) on the summit in 1996. Their expedition was transmitted \"live\" over the Internet. The findings made on Sara Sara are currently stored at the Museo de Santuarios Andinos in Arequipa. The archaeological group of Sara Sara was recommended to be declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2003. \n* Sara Sara and Lake Parinacochas (foreground) as seen from Inka Wasi"

The Strahlkogel is also the highest mountain in the municipality of Umhausen. Its name comes from its great, white, light-reflecting, quartz layers, which allegedly cause the mountain to \"radiate\" (strahlen). It has the shape of a well-proportioned, steep and pointed pyramid. Ascending the Strahlkogel is difficult and it is thus only rarely visited, unlike the neighbouring 3,287-metre-high Breiter Grieskogel. The first ascent of the mountain was in 1833 by Peter Carl Thurwieser, but his route and the precise circumstances of the climb have not been passed on. On 28 August 1887 Ludwig Purtscheller and Fritz Drasch from Salzburg climbed the mountain. Their route led along the west arête. Today, this is the normal route and easiest way to reach the summit."
