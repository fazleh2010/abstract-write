He was born in the Nightingale Maternity Home, Derby, near his father's shop in London Road and brought up there before the family moved to Normanton in 1959. Dixon's most notable role was in the 1981 BBC TV series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which he starred as Ford Prefect. He also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ariel in the 1980 BBC version of The Tempest (directed by John Gorrie). He would later rejoin the Hitchhiker's Guide by lending his voice to the \"Ecological Man\" and the \"Zirzla Leader\" in Fit the Twentieth of the radio series, while Geoffrey McGivern, who had originally played the character on radio, returned to the role of Ford. Despite a relatively sparse TV and film career, David Dixon has over the years acquired a loyal fan following online who call themselves \"Dixonites\"."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Yen.) Donnie Yen (born 27 July 1963), also known as Yen Ji-dan (甄子丹), is a Hong Kong actor, Chinese martial artist, film director and producer, action choreographer, and multiple-time world wushu tournament champion. Yen is credited by many for contributing to the popularization of the traditional martial arts style known as Wing Chun. He played Wing Chun grandmaster Yip Man in the 2008 film Ip Man, which was a box office success. This has led to an increase in the number of people taking up Wing Chun, leading to hundreds of new Wing Chun schools being opened up in mainland China and other parts of Asia. Ip Chun, the eldest son of Ip Man, even mentioned that he is grateful to Yen for making his family art popular and allowing his father's legacy to be remembered. Yen is considered to be one of Hong Kong's top action stars; director Peter Chan mentioned that he \"is the 'it' action person right now\" and \"has built himself into a bona fide leading man, who happens to be an action star.\" Yen is widely credited for bringing mixed martial arts (MMA) into the mainstream of Chinese culture, by choreographing MMA in many of his recent films. Yen has displayed notable skills in a wide variety of martial arts, being well-versed in Tai chi chuan, boxing, kickboxing, Jeet Kune Do, Hapkido, Taekwondo, karate, Muay Thai, wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Wing Chun, and Wushu. Seen as one of the most popular film stars in Asia in recent years, Yen was one of the highest paid actors in Asia in 2009. Yen earned 220 million HKD (28.4 million USD) from four films and six advertisements in 2013."

After training at the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art, Coffey began a career in repertory at the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh, then moved to the Palladium Theatre there. She later worked for the BBC as a radio interviewer, before appearing in London's West End.

Coffey has had a few supporting film roles. These have included Sidonia in Waltz of the Toreadors (1962), Peg in Georgy Girl (1966), Soberness in Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), and Mrs. E in Vivian Stanshall's Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1980).

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Wong.) Dayo Wong Tze-wah (born 5 September 1960) is a Hong Kong stand-up comedian, actor, presenter, screenwriter, and singer, who is the pioneer of stand-up comedy in Hong Kong. Wong gained a degree in philosophy from the University of Alberta in Canada. He began his career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong in 1984, but he is best known for his works in live stand-up comedy which he started performing regularly since 1990. Since then he has starred in TV dramas and films, and recorded his own album. Dayo had his TVB TV series debut in 1999, acting as \"Lai Sam\" in \"Justice Sung 2\". A year later, he reached a milestone of his TV series career. Dayo as a lazy office assistant in a law firm in War of the Gender, winning the My Favourite Television Character Award in 2002. It is when his flame reached his highest point. 2004 was a fruitful year for Dayo as it was when he won two awards: the My Favourite On-Screen Partners (with Ada Choi in \"Catch the Uncatchable\") and again, the My Favourite Television Character Award (also in \"Catch the Uncatchable\"). He was so close to the \"TV King\" Award (The Best Actor Award). He was on the nomination list of the award in both 2007 and 2009. He was finally crowned as TV King with \"Bounty Lady\" in 2013. To Dayo, the award was an accumulative result of his TVB dramas. He also revealed that his relationship with Chilam were like cousins. In that year, Chilam Cheung started as the clear favourite of the audience due to his absolute popularity starring as Captain Cool in \"Triumph in the Skies 2\". Though Chilam ended up winning the Most Popular Male Character, he sounded disappointed in his acceptance speech (the price is widely recognised as a consolation prize to The Best Actor Award). Chilam did not stay behind the ceremony for the TVB official interview. He explained that he was not informed to stay behind for any interview. The discord rumours between Chilam and Dayo begin to spread out widely. However, the rumour was shot down when Chilam surprised Dayo by his sudden appearance at a meal gathering of the Bounty Lady. Besides the TVB drama career, Dayo is also well known to be a stand-up comedian. He introduced stand up comedy to Hong Kong. He has done thirteen stand up comedy routines so far, mainly targeting local Hong Kongnese. Unlike Northern American stand-up comedians, his jokes usually includes a lot of political and philosophical content, which brings up a high level of consonant among audience. \"Hong Kong's housing issue is absolutely ridiculous. I have discussed this in my stand-up shows too. Hong Kong residents need to have 13 to 14 times their current annual salary to finally be qualified for home ownership.\" said the comedian. Up to 2013, he has done as much as thirteen shows. Seven of them were also performed in Australia, Canada and the United States. Dayo's latest talk show was performed on October 2014. A month later, the show was brought to Canada and the United States as well. In comparison with his stand-up comedy and TV dramas, his movies are not as successful. When being asked the reasons behind, he explained that his ultimate goal is to look for something new in his movies. His visions makes his work good to watch, but it is not good enough to attract people to pay for a cinema ticket. The second reason is that he hates doing promotion for his work."

  "text" : "Daphne Rye (1916 – 10 November 1992) was a director, actress and casting director. Rye was casting agent for the company H. M. Tennent. She discovered a number of talents who became big names, including Richard Burton, later one of Rye's lodgers. She also helped Kenneth More and Honor Blackman. Nigel Hawthorne said of her: \"How daunting it was to hear her voice coming from a darkened auditorium during auditions.\" Her theatrical credits as director included Private Lives, Edward, My Son and The Little Hut. She was married three times. Her marriages to the actor Roland Culver and Dr John Janvrin were dissolved. Sam Ainley, her last husband, predeceased her. Rye had two sons from her first marriage, actor Michael Culver and painter Robin Culver. In 1963, with the backing of friends, Rye established a restaurant in Chelsea called Daphne's, which became a celebrity hangout, attracting the likes of Laurence Olivier, David Niven, Alec Guinness and Prince Charles. She died in Spain where she had spent much of her life."

He was born in Vittel and came to prominence when he was cast by Sacha Guitry in Assassins et voleurs (1956) (Assassins and Robbers). Following this he turned to acting in cinema roles and soon gained celebrity status with his role as Antoine Péralou in Le Triporteur (1957) (The Tricycle). A game addict, he often acted only for money in films that did not stretch his acting ability. He explained this by noting he did not read the script (or, on occasion, know the title) of the work in which he was to act. He played Major Archibald in the 1974 film Don't Touch the White Woman!. He had hoped to return to theatre acting in Hold Up in September 2005 but ill-health prevented this. At age 80, he died in Neuilly-sur-Seine from complications of lung cancer."

  "text" : "David King-Wood (12 September 1913 – 3 September 2003) was a British actor. He was born in Tehran, Iran (then Persia), the youngest of four children. His father was William King Wood (CIE, CBE), Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department and his mother was Daisy Adcock, daughter of Sir Hugh Adcock (who was once the physician to the Shah of Persia). He studied at Oxford University and was a keen member of OUDS (Oxford University Dramatic Society) appearing in The Radio Times in April 1936 whilst appearing as Richard II. David King-Wood (he apparently added the hyphen) appeared in British television and films during the 1950s. His Broadway credits include Friar Francis in Much Ado About Nothing (1959) and Adam Hartley in The Hidden River (1957). His British theatre credits include Measure for Measure and Richard III for The Old Vic, seasons with the Birmingham Repertory Company, the Oxford Repertory Company and the Worthing Repertory Company and the 1937 season at the Regent's Park Open Air Festival. He was also a regular performer with the Shakespeare Festival. His film credits include The Blakes Slept Here (1953) The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954) The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) and Jamboree (1957) among others. During the Second World War, his fluency in five languages, including Japanese, was used to the fore, but at the expense of his theatrical career. He relocated to New York in the mid-1950s and acted on Broadway for a number of years. David was also the \"it\" male model for a time and was the \"Marlboro Man\" for a couple of years. He ended his professional life teaching English and French at St. Bernard's School in New York, as well as directing the annual Shakespeare Play there. David loved nature, and as an enthusiastic New Yorker, spent many happy hours in Central Park. More than one hundred and fifty of his friends contributed to the David King-Wood Tree Fund, and two European Linden trees have been endowed in his name. There is a paving stone by the Olmsted Flowerbed at Literary Walk, mid-park at Sixty-Seventh Street, as well as the two trees near the East Meadow."
