  "text" : "William James Hung (born January 13, 1983), also known as Hung Hing Cheong, is a Hong Kong-born American former singer who gained fame in early 2004 as a result of his off-key audition performance of Ricky Martin's hit song \"She Bangs\" on the third season of the television series American Idol. At the time of his audition, Hung was a civil engineering student at UC Berkeley. After his spirited audition to be the next American Idol, he inadvertently won the support of many fans. Hung voluntarily left university to pursue a music career. His recording career was marked by constant negative critical reaction, and his fame became the subject of much controversy as both he and his fans were accused of promoting and endorsing racial stereotypes against Asians, as he was perceived to lack musical talent and be celebrated only for embodying these stereotypes. In spite of the criticism and the implications of his success, he only showed signs of thoroughly enjoying his celebrity, believing he was living his dream. He brought his own career as a musician to an end when in 2011 he accepted a job opportunity as a technical crime analyst for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and decided to pursue law enforcement instead of music. Since then, Hung has reflected positively on his pop music career."

  "text" : "Will Adamsdale (born 1974) is an English actor, comedian and writer. Adamsdale was educated at Eton College and the Oxford School of Drama. In 2004, he starred in a self-penned one man show called Jackson's Way at the Edinburgh Fringe. The intended run for the production was ten days, before the intervention of comedian Stewart Lee. Lee was so impressed by Adamsdale's work that he reportedly threw his full support behind Jackson's Way, lobbying for an extension of the run and using his clout within the industry to garner notice from critics and award committees. Adamsdale secured the Perrier Comedy Award for comedy. Adamsdale has since created several new shows: The Receipt, The Human Computer, and The Summer House. The Receipt, a collaboration with sonic artist Chris Branch, used innovative sound effects to punctuate a story about the little man in the big city. It ran at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006, winning a Fringe First and a Total Theatre Award. It subsequently toured nationally, and internationally to the Melbourne Comedy Festival and 59E59 Theatres in New York. In The Human Computer, Adamsdale, a self-confessed technophobe, explored the world of computers. The show premiered in the new Traverse 3 venue at the Edinburgh Fringe 2007. He made his film acting debut in The Boat That Rocked as Newsreader John, in 2009. He is now a regular cast member of the Channel 4 2011 series Campus, playing Jason the University accountant."

  "text" : "Wilfred Lau Ho-Lung is a Hong Kong singer and actor. He is also known as \"師兄\" (C-Hing, Senpai) in the entertainment industry because he was the winner of the 16th annual New Talent Singing Awards International Finals in 1997, despite not being never actually becoming a singer until 2004. Many have made comparisons to his voice to the voice of Eason Chan. Wilfred attended St. Joseph's Primary School (聖若瑟小學), a boys' school for his primary education, which he was schoolmate of Priscilla Chan's younger brother. He graduated from Kiangsu-Chekiang College. As a child, he had always wanted to become a singer due to seeing Priscilla's awards while he visited her brother's home, but his teacher made him give up his dream. At age 21, after seeing the concerts of Anita Mui and Andy Hui, he finally had enough courage to enter the 1997 New Talent Singing Awards International Finals where he won first place (the Gold award), the Best Performance Award (最佳演繹大獎), and the Best Performance Art Potential Award (最具演藝潛質獎)."

  "text" : "William Allen (died 1647) was a prominent English actor in the Caroline era. He belonged to both of the most important theatre companies of his generation, Queen Henrietta's Men and the King's Men. Allen was a member of the Queen Henrietta's company through the main phase of its existence, from 1625 to 1636. Six cast lists for five plays survive for the company; Allen is one of only two men (the other being Michael Bowyer) who is included in all six lists. Allen played major roles: \n*  Captain Landby in Shirley's The Wedding \n*  Pandolph in Davenport's King John and Matilda \n*  Grimaldi the Renegado in Massinger's The Renegado \n*  Hannibal in Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio \n*  Mullisheg in Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West (both parts). The Queen Henrietta's company was disrupted and fractured by the long theatre closure from May 1636 to October 1637, due to a severe outbreak of bubonic plague. Allen was one of several members of the troupe who disappear from the surviving records in the later 1630s; he may have been among a quartet of Queen's actors who travelled to Dublin with James Shirley to work at the Werburgh Street Theatre there. Allen was certainly in London c. 1640, when he was one of the five former Queen's players who became actors and sharers in the King's Men around that time. Allen and the others were named Grooms of the Chamber in January 1641. After the theatres were closed in September 1642at the start of the English Civil War, Allen, like several other members of the company (Charles Hart, Nicholas Burt, and William Robbins), became an officer in the Royalist army. Allen served as a \"major and quartermaster-general at Oxford.\" He was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647, the year of his death."
