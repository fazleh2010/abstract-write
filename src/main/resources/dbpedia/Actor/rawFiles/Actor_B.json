  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Lee.) Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee, was a Hong Kong and American actor, martial artist, philosopher, filmmaker, and founder of the martial art Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-Chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. Lee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco on November 27, 1940 to parents from Hong Kong and was raised in Kowloon, Hong Kong with his family until his late teens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education, at the University of Washington, at Seattle and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong and the rest of the world. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources, in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality of Hong Kong and the US. He died in Kowloon Tong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32."

After attracting attention for her roles in Russ Meyer's films, Babette Bardot began touring the United States in 1968 as a burlesque dancer under the guidance of her husband and manager, Bob Baker. With the seductive coif of platinum blonde hair and the billing caption \"44-24-38 World's Most Sensational Exotic Entertainer\" her appearances included the Gayety Theatre in New York, the Town Theatre in Chicago and the Colony Club in Dallas. While covering the burlesque circuit, she became a frequent guest on TV and radio programs, including the Wally Phillips Show (WGN-Chicago), The Steve Allen Show and The Phil Donahue Show. She toured in a number of countries, and later found a home at the Majestic Inn (on MacLeod Trail and 50th Ave South) in Calgary, Alberta. The liberal stripping laws in Alberta allowed her to fully strip; however Babette would only remove her tops while retaining a thong. She was the headliner for the hotel bar, the Majic Stik, opening during the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede to a packed house nightly for six months before departing for Las Vegas. Although unconfirmed, Babette claimed that she was a distant relative of Brigitte Bardot and had once modeled for Pablo Picasso while in her late teens. During the Vietnam War, her popularity and public notoriety resulted in a photo insertion in the GI newspaper Stars and Stripes."

  "text" : "Brenda Doreen Mignon de Banzie (28 July 1909 – 5 March 1981) was a British actress of stage and screen. She was the daughter of Edward Thomas de Banzie, conductor and musical director, and his second wife Dorothy (née Lancaster), whom he married in 1908. In 1911, the family lived in Salford, Lancashire. She appeared as Maggie Hobson in the David Lean film version of Hobson's Choice (1954) with John Mills and Charles Laughton, set in Salford. Laughton allegedly didn't like de Banzie because she wasn't getting 'her part right'. De Banzie was also upstaging Laughton who was, by all accounts, a notorious upstager himself. Her most notable film role was as Phoebe Rice, the hapless wife of comedian Archie Rice (played by Laurence Olivier), in the 1960 film version of John Osborne's The Entertainer. She had also appeared on Broadway in the original play, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. Other memorable film roles included The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and The Pink Panther (1963), directed by Blake Edwards. She died at the age of 71 due to complications following brain surgery."

  "text" : "Beryl Drusilla de Zoete, also known as Beryl de Sélincourt (1879 in London – 4 March 1962) was an English ballet dancer, orientalist, dance critic, and dance researcher. She is also known as a translator of Italo Svevo. Born in London, she lived there for most of her life. In 1902 she married Basil de Sélincourt, though the marriage lasted for only a few years. She published poems in the modernist magazine The Open Window. She entered into a lifelong relationship with the Orientalist and translator Arthur Waley, whom she met in 1918 but never married. Her relationship with Arthur Waley was considered an indeterminate relationship in the eyes of observers such as Gerald Brenan. She traveled extensively, particularly in Bali and South Asia. In the field of dance, she taught eurhythmics, investigated Indian dance and theatre traditions, and collaborated with Walter Spies on Dance and Drama in Bali (1937), which is still a standard reference for traditional Balinese dance and theatrical forms. She studied dance, at least in part with Emile Jaques-Dalcroze in 1913 and 1915, and subsequently taught dance until sometime in the 1920s. She wrote on dance at various times for The Daily Telegraph, the New Statesman and Nation and Ballet (edited by Richard Buckle). She published books on dance in Bali (1938), India (1953) and Sri Lanka (1957). According to Harold Acton, she had a tendency to overstretch the hospitality of her friends: when Paola Olivetti, a little vexed, went away from one of her villas, Beryl stayed on; she left only when the cook told her he was going on vacation."

  "text" : "Maria Belita Jepson-Turner (25 October 1923 – 18 December 2005), known professionally as Belita, was a British Olympic figure skater, dancer and film actress. Born at Nether Wallop, Hampshire, she skated (as Belita Jepson-Turner) for the United Kingdom in the 1936 Winter Olympics where she was placed 16th in the Ladies' singles competition, then her career turned towards Hollywood. She had classical Russian ballet training which carried over into her skating, and she was considered far superior to others skating at that time. As a young ballerina she was partner to Anton Dolin, appearing with the Dolin-Markova Ballet. She appeared in films including Never Let Me Go (1953) with Clark Gable and The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949) opposite Charles Laughton. For a brief period she was Monogram Pictures highest paid star. She made several highly profitable productions for Monogram, including Silver Skates (1943), Lady, Let's Dance (1944), and the film noir Suspense (1946). In 1946 Belita married Joel McGinnis; they divorced in 1956. She remarried, to Irish actor James Berwick, né James Kenny (1929–2000). In 1956 she retired from skating and three years later gave up show business altogether. She appeared briefly on the ice at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1981 in a short production based on \"Solitude\" by Duke Ellington. Both marriages were childless. She retired to live in Montpeyroux, Hérault, France, where she died in 2005, aged 82."

Grellis is also known for his role as Phidian, the aide to Sir Hilary Bray in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Originally, this part was slated to be much larger, with a long chase scene involving Phidian after being revealed as a mole of the film's villain, but this was scrapped partway through filming of the sequence due to budgetary restrictions, leaving Grellis with one line of dialogue and less than fifteen seconds of screentime in the finished film. His other film credits included appearances in Only When I Larf (1968), Submarine X-1 (1968), Battle of Britain (1969), Trog (1970), and Fear in the Night (1972)."

She played a radical English teacher, Judy Threadgold, opposite Alun Armstrong’s woodwork teacher in Alan Plater’s Get Lost! for Yorkshire Television, shown in 1981.

  "text" : "Ben Holden Driver Warriss (29 May 1909 – 14 January 1993), known as Ben Warriss, was an English comedian and the first cousin of fellow comedy actor Jimmy Jewel. Allegedly the two cousins were born in the same bed (at different times) and brought up in the same household at 52 Andover Street, Sheffield. He was the son of Benjamin Holden Joseph Warriss, an insurance company inspector, and his wife, Mary Ann, née Driver, Jewel's mother's sister. He first performed on the stage in 1930. Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss came together as professionals in 1934 at the Palace Theatre, Newcastle. Their double act achieved seven Royal Variety Performances, 12 Blackpool summer seasons, a successful radio series (Up the Pole) and a film of the series. Around 1966, the two went their separate ways, with Warriss performing on stage and Jewel moving into television. In the 1970s Warriss was the resident compere at the Cala Gran club in Fleetwood, Lancashire. In 1988 he played the Emperor of China in the first of the newly reopened Hackney Empire pantomimes, Aladdin. He was still performing in pantomime in his eighties. The character Parker from the 1960s TV series of Thunderbirds is said to have been based upon Warriss' appearance. His first wife, whom he married on 22 September 1934, was Grace Mary Skinner (b. 1910-11), a dancer and teacher of dancing and daughter of Henry Arthur James Skinner, master mariner. This marriage had ended by about 1940 and two years later Warriss married the entertainer Meggie Easton. His third marriage, which took place about 1960, was to Virginia Vernon. He died in 1993 at Brinsworth House, Staines Road, Twickenham, and is buried in the same section of Streatham Park Cemetery, London, as comedian Will Hay."

  "text" : "Robert William - \"Bob\" - Bowes (November 19, 1922 - December 1979) was an English actor and teacher. His only film appearance is in Ken Loach's 1969 film Kes. Bob Bowes played the headmaster Mr Gryce in the adaptation of Barry Hines' novel \"A Kestrel for a Knave\", in which a teenage boy from Barnsley, Yorkshire, Billy Casper, finds and trains a young kestrel and in doing so develops a sense of self-respect and discovers his individuality. The character of Gryce - known behind his back as \"Gryce pudding\" to his pupils, is severe, perfunctory and abrupt. He appears constantly in a temper, and does not listen, inflicting punishment even on a boy who has simply been sent to convey a message to him by another teacher. In contrast to the pastoral approach shown by the teacher Mr Farthing - portrayed in the film by Colin Welland, he shows no interest in Billy as a pupil or faith in him as a future member of society (\"heaven help your future employer\"), and regards the young people of the school as being of little worth. At a time when grammar schools were considered superior, the character of Gryce, head of a secondary modern school, emerges as a frustrated and rather pathetic character. One critic has described Bowes' portrayal of him as \"comically vicious...a twentieth-century update of Wackford Squeers, the appalling Yorkshire headmaster of Dotheboys Hall in Nicholas Nickleby\", and in subsequent performances of the play actors playing Gryce have tended to remain close to presentation of the character by Bowes."

However, Méliès evolved the genre of the fictional motion picture, and Bernon became one of the earliest character actors in movies. In 1899, she played the title character in Méliès's Jeanne d'Arc, and Cinderella in Cendrillon. In 1901, she appeared in Barbe-bleue. In 1902 she appeared in a minor role in A Trip to the Moon, which is the best known film of Méliès, as one \"lady in the Moon\". In 1903 she appeared as Aurora in Le Royaume des fées."

  "text" : "Benjamin Charles \"Ben\" Aldridge (born 12 November 1985) is an English actor, born in Devon. After years with the National Youth Theatre, Aldridge graduated from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art with a bursary from the Genesis Foundation for young actors. He left early to begin filming the 2009 ITV film Compulsion alongside Ray Winstone and Parminder Nagra. In 2008, Aldridge made his television debut in Channel 4's four-part miniseries The Devil's Whore, playing Harry Fanshawe, husband of the title character. That same year, he was featured on Screen International's \"Stars of Tomorrow\" list. In addition to First Light, Lewis, Toast and Vera, Aldridge also appeared as Daniel Parish in the BBC One period drama Lark Rise to Candleford. In 2011, the American network The CW cast Aldridge as the lead in the pilot Heavenly. Later on he spent time in Belgrade shooting the partially improvised romance short film In the Night for director Ivana Bobic and award-winning cinematographer Rain Li, alongside supermodel Danijela Dimitrovska. In 2013, Aldridge starred in Almeida Theatre's production of American Psycho as Paul Owen, opposite Matt Smith as Patrick Bateman, Susannah Fielding as Evelyn Williams, Jonathan Bailey as Tim Price and Lucie Jones as Victoria. The musical thriller featured a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa based on Bret Easton Ellis's cult novel, with music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik. The show was directed by Rupert Goold, and run at the Almeida Theatre from 3 December 2013 to 1 February 2014. In September 2014, he joined BBC's original drama series Our Girl as Captain Charles James. In December 2014, Aldridge joined The CW's series Reign as King Antoine of Navarre. Aldridge is a co-founder of \"In the Corner Productions\".
