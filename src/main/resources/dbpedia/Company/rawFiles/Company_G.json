  "text" : "GTE Corporation, formerly General Telephone & Electric Corporation (1955–1982), was the largest independent telephone company in the United States during the days of the Bell System. The company operated from 1926, with roots tracing further back than that, until 2000, when it merged with Bell Atlantic; the combined company took the name Verizon. Originally founded as Associated Telephone Utilities, it went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression, and reorganized as General Telephone in 1934. In 1991, it acquired the third largest independent, Continental Telephone (ConTel). They also owned Automatic Electric, a telephone equipment supplier similar in many ways to Western Electric, and Sylvania Lighting, the only non-communications-oriented company under GTE ownership. GTE provided local telephone service to a large number of areas of the U.S. through operating companies, much as American Telephone & Telegraph provided local telephone service through its 22 Bell Operating Companies. The company also acquired BBN Planet, one of the earliest Internet service providers, in 1997. That division became known as GTE Internetworking, and was later spun off into the independent company Genuity (a name recycled from another Internet company GTE acquired in 1997) to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements regarding the GTE-Bell Atlantic merger that created Verizon. GTE operated in Canada via large interests in subsidiary companies such as BC TEL and Quebec-Téléphone. When foreign ownership restrictions on telecommunications companies were introduced, GTE's ownership was grandfathered. When BC Tel merged with Telus (the name given the privatized Alberta Government Telephones (AGT)) to create BCT.Telus, GTE's Canadian subsidiaries were merged into the new parent, making it the second-largest telecommunications carrier in Canada. As such, GTE's successor, Verizon Communications, was the only foreign telecommunications company with a greater than 20% interest in a Canadian carrier, until Verizon completely divested itself of its shares in 2004. In the Caribbean, CONTEL purchased several major stakes in the newly independent countries of the British West Indies (namely in Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago). Prior to GTE's merger with Bell Atlantic, GTE also maintained an interactive television service joint-venture called GTE mainStreet (sometimes also called mainStreet USA) as well as an interactive entertainment and video game publishing operation, GTE Interactive Media."

  "text" : "Gulf Oil was a major global oil company from the 1900s to the 1980s. The eighth-largest American manufacturing company in 1941 and the ninth-largest in 1979, Gulf Oil was one of the so-called Seven Sisters oil companies. Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh. Gulf's former headquarters, originally referred to as \"the Gulf Building\" (now the Gulf Tower office condos), is an art-deco skyscraper. The tallest building in Pittsburgh until 1970, when it was eclipsed by the U.S. Steel Tower, it is capped by a step pyramid structure several stories high. Until the late 1970s, the entire top was illuminated, changing color with changes in barometric pressure to provide a weather indicator that could be seen for many miles. Gulf Oil Corporation (GOC) ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), with both re-branding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf's main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia & York. However, the Gulf brand name and a number of the constituent business divisions of GOC survived. Gulf has experienced a significant revival since 1990, emerging as a flexible network of allied business interests based on partnerships, franchises and agencies. Gulf, in its present incarnation, is a \"new economy\" business. It employs very few people directly and its assets are mainly in the form of intellectual property: brands, product specifications and scientific expertise. The rights to the brand in the United States are owned by Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLC), which operates over 2,100 service stations and several petroleum terminals; it is headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts. The corporate vehicle at the center of the Gulf network outside the United States, Spain and Portugal is Gulf Oil International, a company owned by the Hinduja Group. The company's focus is primarily in the provision of downstream products and services to a mass market through joint ventures, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, and distribution arrangements. Gulf Oil International has its head office in the City of Westminster, London."

Gaumont predominantly produces, co-produces, and distributes films, and in 2011, 95% of Gaumont's consolidated revenues came from the film division. The company is increasingly becoming a TV series producer with its new American subsidiary Gaumont International Television as well as its existing French production features."

In the late 1980s, Bertone styled the K20 motorcycle helmet for Swiss bicycle and motorcycle helmet manufacturer Kiwi. The company was based in Grugliasco in northern Italy. Gruppo Bertone was founded as Carrozzeria Bertone in 1912 by Giovanni Bertone. Designer Nuccio Bertone took charge of the company after World War II and the company was divided into two units: Carrozzeria for manufacturing and Stile Bertone for styling. Until its bankruptcy in 2014, the company was headed by the widow of Nuccio Bertone, Lilli Bertone."

  "text" : "Gottlieb (formerly D. Gottlieb & Co.) was an arcade game corporation based in Chicago, Illinois. The main office and plant was located at 1140-50 N. Kostner Avenue until the early 1970s when a new modern plant and office was located at 165 W. Lake Street in Northlake, IL. A subassembly plant was located in Fargo, ND. The company was established by David Gottlieb in 1927, initially producing pinball machines while later expanding into various other games including pitch-and-bats, bowling games, and eventually video arcade games (notably Reactor and Q*bert and, leading to the demise of Mylstar; M*A*C*H*3). Like other manufacturers, Gottlieb first made mechanical pinball machines, including the first successful coin-operated pinball machine Baffle Ball in 1930. Electromechanical machines were produced starting in 1935. The 1947 development of player-actuated, solenoid-driven 2-inch bats called \"flippers\" revolutionized the industry. Players now had the ability to shoot the ball back up the playfield and get more points. The flippers first appeared on a Gottlieb game called \"Humpty Dumpty\", designed by Harry Mabs. By this time, the games also became noted for their artwork by Roy Parker. In the late 1950s the company made more widespread use of digital score reels, making multiple player games more practical as most scoring was expressed by cluttered series of lights in the back box. The score reels eventually appeared on single-player games, now known as \"wedgeheads\" because of their distinctive tapering back box shape. By the 1970s the artwork on Gottlieb games was almost always by Gordon Morison, and the company had begun designing their games with longer 3-inch flippers, now the industry standard. The company made the move into solid state machines starting in the late 1970s. The first few of these were remakes of electromechanical machines such as \"Joker Poker\" and \"Charlie's Angels\". By that time, multiple player machines were more the mode and wedgeheads were no longer being produced. The last wedgehead was \"T.K.O.\" (1979) and the last single player machine was \"Asteroid Annie and The Aliens\" (1980) Gottlieb was bought by Columbia Pictures in 1976. In 1983, after the Coca-Cola Company had acquired Columbia, Gottlieb was renamed to Mylstar Electronics, but this proved to be short-lived. By 1984 the video game industry in North America was in the middle of a shakeout and Columbia closed down Mylstar at the end of September 1984. A management group, led by Gilbert G. Pollock, purchased Mylstar's pinball assets in October 1984 and continued the manufacture of pinball machines under a new company, Premier Technology. As a result of this a number of prototype Mylstar arcade games, which were not purchased by the investors, were never released. Premier did go on to produce one last arcade game, 1989's Exterminator. Premier Technology, which returned to selling pinball machines under the name Gottlieb after the purchase, continued in operation until the summer of 1996, when the declining demand for pinball machines forced the company to cease business. Premier did not file for bankruptcy, but sold off all its assets for the benefit of its creditors. Gottlieb's most popular pinball machine was Baffle Ball (released mid-1931), and their final machine was Barb Wire (early 1996)."

  "text" : "The Goodrich Corporation, formerly the B.F. Goodrich Company, was an American aerospace manufacturing company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in Akron, Ohio in 1870 as Goodrich, Tew & Co. by Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich. The company name was changed to the \"B.F. Goodrich Company\" in 1880, to BFGoodrich in the 1980s, and to \"Goodrich Corporation\" in 2001. In 1869 Benjamin Franklin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio, to relocate his business there. Goodrich ranked 67th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. The company grew to be one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world, helped in part by the 1986 merger with Uniroyal (formerly the United States Rubber Company). This product line was sold to Michelin in 1988, and the company merged with Rohr (1997), Coltec Industries, and TRW Aeronautical Systems (formerly Lucas Aerospace) in 2002. The sale of the specialty chemicals division and subsequent change to the current name completed the transformation. In 2006, company sales were $5.8 billion, of which 18%, 16% and 12% of total revenues were accounted for by the U.S. government, Airbus and Boeing, respectively. Though BFGoodrich is a popular brand name of tires, the Goodrich Corporation exited the tire business in 1988. The tire business and use of the name was sold to Michelin. Before the sale to Michelin, Goodrich ran television and print ads showing an empty blue sky, to distinguish themselves from the similar-sounding Goodyear tire company. The tag line was, \"See that blimp up in the sky? We're the other guys!\" The company was also sometimes confused with Mr. Goodwrench as the two last names were similar, especially when B.F. Goodrich tires were featured on many General Motors cars and trucks."

  "text" : "Gateway Inc. is an American computer hardware company based in South Dakota, that developed, manufactured, supported, and marketed a wide range of personal computers, computer monitors, servers, and computer accessories. It became a well-known brand in 1991 when it started shipping its computer hardware in piebald boxes and for its creative advertising in Computer Shopper and other magazines. Gateway was acquired by Acer in October 2007, for approximately US$710 million. Gateway outsourced some of its operations, such as customer support. In 2002, Gateway expanded into the consumer electronics world with products that included plasma screen TVs, digital cameras, DLP projectors, wireless Internet routers, and MP3 players. While the company enjoyed some success in gaining substantial market share from traditional leaders in the space, particularly with plasma TVs and digital cameras, the limited short-term profit potential of those product lines led then-CEO Wayne Inouye to pull the company out of that segment during 2004. Gateway still acts as a retailer selling third-party electronic goods online."

  "text" : "The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is an American multinational tire manufacturing company founded in 1898 by Frank Seiberling and based in Akron, Ohio. Goodyear manufactures tires for automobiles, commercial trucks, light trucks, motorcycles, SUVs, race cars, airplanes, farm equipment and heavy earth-mover machinery. The company was named after American Charles Goodyear, inventor of vulcanized rubber. The first Goodyear tires became popular because they were easily detachable and required little maintenance. Goodyear is also known for the Goodyear Blimp. Though Goodyear had been manufacturing airships and balloons since the early 1900s, the first Goodyear advertising blimp flew in 1925. Today it is one of the most recognizable advertising icons in America. The company is the most successful tire supplier in Formula One history, with more starts, wins, and constructors' championships than any other tire supplier. They pulled out of the sport after the 1998 season. It is the sole tire supplier for NASCAR series. Goodyear is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company opened a new global headquarters building in Akron in 2013."

  "text" : "G&L is a guitar design and production company founded by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Dale Hyatt in the late 1970s. Fender sold his eponymous company Fender in 1965. He designed and produced instruments for Music Man in the 1970s through his company CLF Research. When relations with Music Man soured, G&L was created to continue operations outside of Music Man. The G&L name comes from the initials of George Fullerton and Leo Fender. G&L instruments are similar to the classic Fenders, but with some modern innovations. They are built at the same facility on Fender Avenue in Fullerton, California that produced the early Music Man instruments. G&L instruments are not widely distributed but are highly regarded by many musicians and collectors. The relatively small scale of production further allows for more custom options that are not possible on larger production lines. After the death of Leo Fender in 1991, Fender's wife, Phyllis Fender, passed the management of G&L to John C. McLaren of BBE Sound. George Fullerton remained a permanent consultant until his death on July 4, 2009, and Leo's wife Phyllis remains as Honorary Chairman of G&L. In a print advertisement for G&L, Leo Fender claimed the G&L line of instruments were \"the best instruments I have ever made.\""

Founded as the Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer, the company changed its name to the General Shoe Company in the 1930s and became a public company in 1939. The company took its current name, Genesco, in 1959. Genesco exited footwear manufacturing in 2002 and now contracts with independent, third parties located outside the United States to manufacture its branded and licensed footwear. In June 2011, Genesco acquired UK retail chain and web business Schuh. This was seen as a huge step for the business as it gave them an already well established grounding in a market outside of the U.S."

On several occasions, this led to controversy when the site refused to pay players seen to be only playing in order to claim the free money and not for the entertainment value. One key incident led to the site's former software provider, Microgaming, terminating their agreement. This led GoldenPalace and its sister casinos to move to rival Playtech software in 2003. Starting with December 2013 Golden Palace has moved to IGSONLINE – for both gaming solution and affiliate platform."

  "text" : "Bull SAS (also known as Groupe Bull, Bull Information Systems, or simply Bull) is a French-owned computer company headquartered in Les Clayes-sous-Bois, in the western suburbs of Paris. The company has also been known at various times as Bull General Electric, Honeywell Bull, CII Honeywell Bull, and Bull HN. Bull was founded in 1931, as H.W. Egli - Bull, to capitalize on the punched card technology patents of Norwegian engineer Fredrik Rosing Bull (1882–1925). After a reorganization in 1933, with new owners coming in, the name was changed to Compagnie des Machines Bull. The company has undergone many takeovers and mergers since its formation. In particular, it has had various ownership relations with General Electric, Honeywell, and NEC from the 1960s to the 1980s; and with Motorola, Debeka, and France Télécom more recently. It acquired Honeywell Information Systems in the late 1980s, and later also had a share of Zenith Data Systems and Packard Bell. Bull was nationalised in 1982 and was merged with most of the rest of the French computer industry. In 1994, the company was re-privatised. Bull has a worldwide presence in more than 100 countries, and is particularly active in the defense, finance, health care, manufacturing, public and telecommunication sectors. In August, 2014 the French IT company Atos announced that it had acquired a controlling stake in Bull SA through a tender offer launched in May. Atos announced plans in October, 2014 to buy out or squeeze out the remaining share and bondholders. Bull launched the Hoox m2, the first integrally secured European smartphone, which in June 2014 was approved for use with data classified as 'Restricted Information' ('Diffusion Restreinte') by the National Information Systems Security Agency (ANSSI). The Hoox range of secure mobiles and smartphones ensures confidentiality of voice, SMS, e-mail and data communication."

The company originated from a Quake fan site founded by Mark Surfas in 1996; after the release of a multiplayer server browser for the game, QSpy, Surfas licensed the software under the GameSpy brand to other video game publishers through a newly established company, GameSpy Industries, which also incorporated his Planet Network of video game news and information websites, and GameSpy.com. GameSpy merged with IGN in 2004; by 2014, its services had been used by over 800 video game publishers and developers since its launch. In August 2012, the GameSpy Industries division (which remained responsible for the GameSpy service) was acquired by mobile video game developer Glu Mobile. IGN (then owned by News Corporation) retained ownership of the GameSpy.com website. In February 2013, IGN's new owner, Ziff Davis, shut down IGN's \"secondary\" sites, including GameSpy's network. This was followed by the announcement in April 2014 that GameSpy's service platform would be shut down on May 31, 2014."

  "text" : "Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products that include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and software. Most of its profits are derived from AdWords, an online advertising service that places advertising near the list of search results. Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its interests as a holding company called Alphabet Inc. When this restructuring took place on October 2, 2015, Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, as well as the parent for Google's Internet interests. Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Sheets and Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+), instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo/Duo/Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and turn-by-turn navigation (Google Maps), video-sharing (YouTube), taking notes (Google Keep), organizing and editing photos (Google Photos), and a web browser (Google Chrome). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS for a class of netbooks known as Chromebooks and desktop PCs known as Chromeboxes. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its \"high-quality low-cost\" Nexus devices, and in October 2016, it launched multiple hardware products (the Google Pixel, Home, Wifi, and Daydream View), with new hardware chief Rick Osterloh stating that \"a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring controlling the end-to-end user experience\". In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service. Google has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world (as of 2007). It processes over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day (as of 2009).In December 2013, Alexa listed Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger. Google's mission statement from the outset was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" and its unofficial slogan was \"Don't be evil\". In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\". Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly been called into doubt due to a number of actions and behaviours which appear to contradict this."

  "text" : "Guardians of Order was a Canadian company founded in 1996 by Mark C. MacKinnon in Guelph, Ontario. The company's business output consisted of role-playing games (RPGs). Their first game is the anime inspired Big Eyes, Small Mouth. In 2006 Guardians of Order ceased operations due to overwhelming debt. The Big Eyes, Small Mouth game used the Tri-Stat System. The Tri-Stat System would later be modified for use in other games and be more generally named the Tri-Stat dX system. Most of Guardians of Order's game use some form of the Tri-Stat dX system. After Big Eyes, Small Mouth, Guardians of Order would go on to achieve significant success with the Sailor Moon Role-playing Game and Resource Book. The game was built on Big Eyes, Small Mouth but featured an extensive reference to the Sailor Moon universe. Guardians of Order acquired licenses and published Big Eyes, Small Mouth-based RPGs for a number of other anime series including Dominion, Demon City Shinjuku, and Tenchi Muyo!. After El Hazard, the last such game, the company's strategy with licensed anime series changed and it began issuing \"Ultimate Fan Guides\" which served the same purpose while avoiding the need to reprint the same BESM-based mechanics. All of these books included game statistics for characters in the series as well as extensive episode guides and character summaries. Guardians of Order expanded beyond anime based games when the Tri-Stat dX system was adopted for the superhero game Silver Age Sentinels. Guardians of Order later acquired the rights to publish the Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game from Phage Press. Guardians of Order licensed the rights to produce role-playing games set in existing fictional works. These include games based on The Authority, Tékumel, and A Song of Ice and Fire. Between February 14, 2006 and August 1, 2006 there were no official updates to the Guardians of Order website. There was speculation on the official forums that the company was out of business. On July 28, 2006 a post to George R. R. Martin's official web site announced that Guardians of Order was out of business. In response, on August 1 Mark MacKinnon posted confirmation that Guardians of Order \"ceased operations.\" According to MacKinnon the company had too much debt. MacKinnon is attempting to place Guardians of Orders games with other companies, and promised that existing orders would be filled. On September 9, 2006 ArtHaus Games, whose titles are published by White Wolf Publishing, announced that it has acquired the Big Eyes, Small Mouth RPG. The announcement stated the company was \"extremely confident\" that a release date of January 2007 would be met and confirmed that those who pre-ordered and prepaid for the book would be \"in good hands,\" though it was also said that they have not taken on Guardians of Order's liabilities. On March 7, 2007 George R. R. Martin wrote that he had regained control of his intellectual property rights and was \"all square\" with Guardians of Order. As part of their settlement, Mr. Martin received all remaining stock of the limited edition version of the RPG. No further information regarding the settlement was revealed, nor the status of other creditors' claims on the property."

  "text" : "Gathering of Developers, Inc. was a Texas-based PC and video games publishing company, founded in January 1998 by Mike Wilson and others. Their mission was to bridge the gap between publishers and independent game developers, allowing independent developers creative control over their projects, ownership of their intellectual property (IP), and participation in the publishing and marketing decisions. Its founding was caused by the tightknit development of the game Daikatana by Ion Storm, where only a few people had a say in the development, coined by the phrase \"Design is Law\", coupled by the publisher Eidos giving into demands such as the removal of milestones. Fueled by past publishing experiences and frustrations, several experienced development companies bound together to form a relationship-based publisher. The company later became a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive. Gathering of Developers' first wave of releases included Railroad Tycoon II, Nocturne, Darkstone, Age of Wonders and Fly!. The company later expanded to the console market. Take-Two acquired the company outright in May 2000, and attempted unsuccessfully to manage the Texas-based group from its New York office. The founders and employees of Gathering of Developers were unhappy with the lack of freedom the company allowed for following through on its principles of fair treatment of developers and IP ownership. Founder Doug Myres died unexpectedly in May 2001, prompting the other partners to negotiate a separation with the company shortly thereafter. Eventually Take-Two took over all operations and rebranded the studio simply Gathering, and have since folded it into the label 2K Games. During the gaming trade event E3, Gathering of Developers was known for being extremely extravagant, offering free barbecue, live music, and beer to the nearly 10,000 E3 attendees that would cross the street into their \"Promised Lot\" each day; they were also famous for their Catholic Schoolgirl 'booth babes'."

Friedrich Gretsch manufactured banjos, tambourines, and drums until his death in 1895. In 1916, his son, Fred Gretsch Sr. moved operations to Brooklyn, New York where Gretsch went on to become one of the most prominent manufacturers of American musical instruments. Most modern-era Gretsch guitars are manufactured in the Far East, though American-made \"Custom Shop\" models are available. In 2003, Gretsch entered a business agreement with Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC). Under the terms of that agreement Fred W. Gretsch would retain ownership while FMIC would handle most of the development, distribution and sales."

A number of mergers and acquisitions followed during the 1990s, and in 1999, the company was purchased by Electronics Boutique Limited, which rebranded itself as The Game Group. The company continued to expand during the 2000s, purchasing several retailers including Gameswizards in Australia. In March 2012, several suppliers, including Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Capcom refused to supply their latest products due to concerns over Game's creditworthiness. Game subsequently entered administration on 26 March 2012, and was purchased by OpCapita the following week. Baker Acquisitions was subsequently renamed Game Retail Ltd. The company operated in the United Kingdom under the Game and Gamestation brands from the acquisition of the latter in May 2007 until late-2012, when it was announced that the business would focus solely on the Game brand."

  "text" : "GEOS (株式会社ジオス Kabushiki Gaisha Jiosu) was one of the Big Four private eikaiwa, or English conversation teaching companies, in Japan. Its extensive network of overseas schools made it the world's largest language school chain. The firm went into bankruptcy in Japan on 20 April 2010. Its headquarters were in the Shin Osaki Kangyo Building (新大崎勧業ビルディング Shin Ōsaki Kangyō Birudingu) in Shinagawa, Tokyo. GEOS (Eikaiwa), which stands for Global Education Opportunities and Services, was formed in 1973 by Tsuneo Kusunoki. The first school was based in Tokushima City, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, also the location of one of the company's main registered offices. The GEOS Eikaiwa group also ran children-only schools called \"Kodomo Schools\" (子供校) throughout Japan. The adult GEOS Eikaiwa Schools had themselves taken on more classes for children. As of February 2007, GEOS had a total of around 500 \"Kodomo\" and adult schools in Japan and over 55 schools in countries outside Japan. The main language the school taught was English. Other languages included French, Spanish, Italian, German, Chinese and Korean. The school also taught Japanese to foreigners living in Japan at their Kudan Japanese Culture, Research Center and Language Institute in Kudanshita, Tokyo. The school used a one-teacher system it calls \"Tanninsei\" where students keep the same teacher for an extended period of time and advertised this system as having benefits of promoting continuity and strong teacher-student relationship. The GEOS Eikaiwa Corporation filed for bankruptcy on April 21, 2010; 99 schools were closed and the remaining 230 were sold to G.Communication, which is also the \"sponsor\" of Nova. On October 1, 2010 the schools were resold to Inayoshi Capital. The GEOS Eikaiwa Group has subsequently ceased trading. After a successful purchase in 2011 the German-based Sprachcaffe Languages Plus currently operates 11 of the former GEOS Eikaiwa schools under the 'GEOS' brand."

Using these methods, Gemesis has produced high-quality colorless and fancy color diamonds that have been offered for sale at 20–30% lower prices than mined natural diamonds of similar quality (and, from some suppliers, lower prices than that). Gemesis is the principal producer of gem-quality lab-created diamonds and jewelry. The company was renamed as Pure Grown Diamonds in June 2014. Gemesis started marketing its diamonds by cutting and polishing them and then selling them to jewelry retailers on the wholesale market. In 2012, the company began also selling polished diamonds and diamond jewelry directly to consumers through its website."

  "text" : "Google Maps is a desktop web mapping service developed by Google. It offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360° panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions (Google Traffic), and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle (in beta), or public transportation. Google Maps began as a C++ desktop program designed by Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allows users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide. Google Maps' satellite view is a \"top-down\" or \"birds eye\" view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800 to 1,500 feet (240 to 460 m), while most other imagery is from satellites. Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis. Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore cannot accurately show areas around the poles. The current redesigned version of the desktop application was made available in 2013, alongside the \"classic\" (pre-2013) version. Google Maps for mobile was released in September 2008 and features GPS turn-by-turn navigation. In August 2013, it was determined to be the world's most popular app for smartphones, with over 54% of global smartphone owners using it at least once. In 2012, Google reported having over 7,100 employees and contractors directly working in mapping."

GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT) was founded in 1988 as a joint venture between GEC and the British electronics, defence and telecommunications company Plessey. A joint holding company of GEC and the German conglomerate Siemens AG acquired Plessey a year later, and GPT was converted into a 60/40 GEC/Siemens joint venture. During the mid-1990s, the name GPT gradually disappeared in the UK. By October 1997, the company evolved into Siemens GEC Communication Systems (SCGS); later in 1998 it amalgamated into the largest division of Siemens - Siemens Communications, and eventually Siemens Enterprise Communications in 2008. In August 1998, GEC acquired the 40% stake of Siemens in GPT (by now only existing as a legal entity), and merged it into its newly founded subsidiary Marconi Communications. Through a series of mergers, divisions and restructuring in 1998/1999, GEC was renamed to Marconi plc, which was again restructured to Marconi Corporation plc in May 2003. Eventually in 2005, Marconi Corporation plc along with its subsidiary Marconi Communications, was sold to Ericsson and the remainder was renamed Telent plc."

In September 2012 GM and Avtovaz purchased EBRD's share, turning the joint venture into a 50/50 relationship. In 2004 the joint venture briefly produced the Chevrolet Viva, based on the 1998 Opel Astra saloon, but after low sales of only 5,000 the model was dropped. The joint venture reached difficulties and production stoppages for a fortnight in February 2006 when AvtoVAZ was taken over by Rosoboronexport, the Russian state-owned arms-export agency, and a disagreement between the new owners and GM lead to stoppages of the supply of engines and other components. The joint venture announced plans in September 2012 to expand by 2015, with an additional 1400 staff and increasing its annual production capacity from 100,000 to 120,000 vehicles."

John’s son, Jonathan Grado, recently entered the company as the third generation of Grado. Grado specializes in dynamic open-air, supra-aural, high-fidelity headphones. In its over 60-year history, Grado has kept a very low profile by relying on word-of-mouth among audio dealers and consumers instead of mass advertising campaigns. Nearly all of Grado's products are hand-crafted in Brooklyn, New York. In 2014, Grado released their new line of headphones, The e Series, and was named in the Top Eight Most Social Small Companies in America by Mashable and American Express. In 2015 JetBlue partnered with Grado to bring their headphones to their Mint Flights."

  "text" : "The Gauntlet, also known as Gauntlet Enterprises, was a business founded in November 1975 by Jim Ward that pioneered the field of body piercing in North America. It was inspired by Ward's friend and mentor, Doug Malloy. The Gauntlet's original location was in Ward's West Hollywood home, but on the evening of Friday, November 17, 1978 it celebrated the grand opening of its first commercial location at 8720 Santa Monica Blvd. (also in West Hollywood). Eventually, Gauntlet opened stores in San Francisco, New York City, and Seattle, as well as a franchise in Paris. The Gauntlet's clientele originated from the gay S&M communities of Southern California and Northern California and during the years that Ward ran his business from his home, many Gauntlet customers came from a group of gay Los Angeles men known as the T&P Group (for Tattooing & Piercing). The Gauntlet became known as a fashionable location for body piercing and its customer base grew beyond its original roots. At its heyday, The Gauntlet operated a strong mail order business for piercing jewelry and manufactured its own jewelry. Eventually, manufacturing operations were contracted out to other companies. Not only did The Gauntlet manufacture jewelry, Ward and his team developed a number of the types of body jewelry in use today. This included coining the terms \"barbell\", \"circular barbell\", and \"captive bead ring\". The work done by Ward and others at this studio set the standard for the body piercings most commonly practiced in modern commercial settings. In addition to selling body jewelry and related equipment, The Gauntlet published a periodical called PFIQ, or Piercing Fans International Quarterly. Originally a mostly black and white newsletter, PFIQ evolved into a full-color glossy with photos, artwork, stories and tips related to body piercing. During its years of publication, PFIQ was the principal source for information on body piercing. A related publication, Pin Pals, was a newsletter in which pierced people could place classified personal advertisements. Eventually, The Gauntlet experienced financial difficulties and the illness of Jim Ward further contributed to its woes. After a run of over twenty years, The Gauntlet closed its doors in late 1998."

Guthrie was founded in Singapore in 1821 by Alexander Guthrie, as the first British trading company in Southeast Asia. Guthrie introduced rubber and oil palm in Malaysia in 1896 and 1924 respectively. Alexander Guthrie was born in the parish of Menmuir in Angus, Scotland in 1796, son of David Guthrie of Burnside and his wife Margaret Guthrie, née Guthrie. He went to Singapore in 1821 to set up a trading branch of Thomas Talbot Harrington and Company. Guthrie parted company with Harrington in 1823, and his company was renamed Guthrie and Company in 1833. He retired in 1847, handing the firm over to his nephew James Guthrie, and retired to London, where he died unmarried in 165. James Guthrie was born in Tannadice in Angus in 1814, son of Alexander's brother David and his wife Katharine Grant. James arrived in Singapore in 1829 and became a partner in 1837. He married in 1846 Susan Scott, a distant cousin, and had two daughters and a son before Susan's death in Singapore in 1853. James left Singapore in 1856 and returned to Britain. He retired from the firm in 1876 and died in 1900. Other partners included James' nephew by marriage, John James Greenshields, whose mother Margaret Lyall Scott was the sister of Susan Scott. Greenshields was born in Liverpool in 1823 and died there in 1873. Another was James Guthrie's brother-in-law Thomas Scott, born in Dun, Angus in 1832 and died in Angus in 1902, who became a partner in 1857 and senior partner in 1867."

The company is now a part of Diageo, a company formed from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in 1997. The main product of the brewery is Guinness Draught. Originally leased in 1759 to Arthur Guinness at IR£45 (Irish pounds) per year for 9,000 years, St. James's Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and the largest in the world by 1886, with an annual output of 1.2 million barrels. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. The company has since bought out the originally leased property, and during the 19th and early 20th centuries the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant. There is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse."

After being called Connected Home Solutions, it was renamed Home and Networks Mobility in 2007. When Motorola split on January 4, 2011, this division became part of Motorola Mobility. On December 19, 2012, ARRIS announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility's Home unit (the former General Instrument company) from Google for $2.35 billion in cash and stock. The acquisition was completed on April 17, 2013. Moses Shapiro, father of former Monsanto head Robert B. Shapiro, was Chairman from 1969 to 1975. Frank G. Hickey served as chief executive officer from 1975 to 1990, as did Donald Rumsfeld from 1990 to 1993."

Grupo Modelo also brews brands intended solely for the domestic Mexican market, Estrella (a local beer found only in western Mexico); and León and Montejo (originally local to Yucatán but now available nationwide). Grupo Modelo has exclusive rights in Mexico for the import and distribution of beer produced by Anheuser-Busch.Until the 1960s, Grupo Modelo used red poppy flowers in its advertising, where almost any image it used had poppy flowers somewhere in the image. On June 12, 2008, The Wall Street Journal stated that Anheuser-Busch InBev, which owned a non-controlling 50% stake in the company, may attempt to acquire the remaining 50%. On June 29, 2012, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch InBev would acquire the remaining 50% stake for an all-cash price of $20.1 billion. On January 31, 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed an anti-trust suit in an attempt to prevent the buyout. The matter was settled and the two companies merged in June 2013, with the transfer of all United States rights to Constellation Brands. As a result, all of the company's brands are made (in Mexico) by an unrelated company. The company no longer is allowed to export to the United States."

The company also manufactures and distributes Under Armour and New Balance brand socks. The company has approximately 42,000 employees worldwide, and owns and operates manufacturing facilities in Rio Nance, Honduras and the Caribbean. Glenn and Greg Chamandy founded Gildan in 1984 with the acquisition of a knitting mill in Montreal, Canada, to make fabric to supply the Harley Inc., the childrenswear business already owned by the family. It later expanded to sell t-shirts made of 100% cotton to wholesalers, which resold them to United States and Canadian screen-printers, to be decorated with designs and logos. By 1994, Harley was closed in order to focus on the expansion of what had become Gildan Activewear. The combination of low wages and advanced technology has allowed Gildan to lower its price per shirt to below that of Chinese manufacturers."

  "text" : "Giovanola Freres SA was one of the prominent thrill ride manufacturers in the world. It was well known for thrill rides and also built electrical power stations, water storage tanks, pipelines, highway bridges, and many other steel products. The company started out as a small metal forging shop, founded by Joseph Giovanola in 1888. It served as a subcontractor to Intamin supplying rides and roller coasters. In 1998 Giovanola started marketing directly under the name Giovanola Amusement Rides Worldwide. The company was based in Monthey, Switzerland. During its last years in business, Giovanola fashioned steel behind the scenes for companies such as Intamin and Bolliger & Mabillard. The company also built its own thrill rides and roller coasters from 1998 to 2001. Examples of Giovanola roller coasters are Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Titan at Six Flags Over Texas and Anaconda at South Africa's Gold Reef City. Giovanola built several submarines: the Auguste Piccard, the Ben Franklin and the F.-A. Forel. Giovanola filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001 after the completion of Titan at Six Flags Over Texas and left the roller coaster building business. The company went completely bankrupt in 2004."

GCI designed roller coasters are known for their often curved drops, twisted layouts, and perception of high speed. Exciting elements such as the station fly-by and station fly-through have been incorporated in many of their layouts. Many GCI designed roller coasters also contain an on-ride camera midway through or towards the end of the ride."

  "text" : "The Grolier Poetry Book Shop (\"the Grolier\") is an independent bookstore on Plympton Street near Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Although founded as a \"first edition\" bookstore, its focus today is solely poetry. A small (404 sq ft (37.5 m2)), one-room store with towering bookcases, it lays claim to being the \"oldest continuous bookshop\" devoted solely to the sale of poetry and poetry criticism. Over the years, the Grolier became a focus of poetic activity in the Cambridge area, which itself had, because of the influence of Harvard University, become a magnet for American poets. It became a point of call for visiting poets as well as a nexus of gossip, rumor and networking in the poetry community. Poets such as John Ashbery, Robert Bly, Robert Creeley, Donald Hall, and Frank O'Hara were regulars at the store during their time as undergraduates at Harvard; the poet Conrad Aiken lived upstairs from the store in its early days. Numerous other poets and writers, including Russell Banks, Frank Bidart, William Corbett, E. E. Cummings, T. S. Eliot, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, David Ferry, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Marianne Moore, Charles Olson, Robert Pinsky, Adrienne Rich, Ruth Stone, James Tate and Franz Wright, have been noted as \"friends of the Grolier.\""

  "text" : "Goldcorp is a gold producer headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company employs about 15,800 people worldwide, engaged in gold mining and related activities including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. Goldcorp’s operating assets include four mines in Canada, two mines in Mexico, and four in Central and South America. As of the third quarter of 2014, Goldcorp was the world's fourth-largest producer of gold. In June 2016, Goldcorp was named one of Corporate Knights magazine's Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada. In the same year, the company was also ranked among Canada's Top 100 Employers. Goldcorp has repeatedly been accused of harming the environment, livestock, and public health in multiple studies by advocacy groups and activists, contaminating areas with toxic heavy metals by its mining activities. These allegations have been refuted by the company and none of these allegations have been proved in a court of law. The company's track record around transparency, policies and practices has improved since a damning 2010 study accused the company of human rights violations."

On August 17, 1849 it entered into a formal contract with the East India Company for the construction and operation of an experimental line, 56 km long, to form part of a trunk line connecting Bombay with Khandesh and Berar and generally with the other presidencies of India. The Court of Directors of the East India Company appointed James John Berkeley as Chief Resident Engineer and C. B. Kar and R. W. Graham as his assistants. It was India's ever first railway, the original 21 mile (33.8 km) section opening in 1853, between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane). On July 1, 1925 its management was taken over by the Government. On November 5, 1951 it was incorporated into the Central Railway."

  "text" : "Gerber Scientific Inc., located in Tolland, Connecticut, is the parent of companies that supply software and hardware systems for apparel and technical textiles, sign making and specialty graphics, composites and packaging applications. Headquartered in Tolland, Connecticut, USA, the company operates through four businesses: Gerber Technology, Gerber Scientific Products, Virtek Vision International and Yunique Solutions. Gerber Scientific is owned by Vector Capital, a San Francisco-based, global private equity firm specializing in the technology sector that manages more than $2 billion of equity capital. On August 18, 2011, Gerber Scientific’s stockholders approved the take-private transaction of Gerber Scientific, Inc. by Vector Capital in a transaction valued at approximately $283 million. CITIC Capital Partners, a leading China based private equity firm, has a minority stake in Gerber Scientific alongside Vector. The business began as the Gerber Scientific Instrument Co., founded in 1948 by Austria native Joseph Gerber to support his invention of a variable scale, the first of 675 patents he'd eventually hold. In 1994, President Bill Clinton presented Joseph Gerber with the National Medals of Technology and Science at a ceremony at the White House in Washington DC, USA. In 2004, Gerber Technology received the Export Achievement Award from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The award is presented to companies whose exports increase consistently year over year and account for a significant portion of revenue. In 2007, Gerber Technology received the President’s “E” Award, the nation’s highest award to honor American exporters in a ceremony in Washington D.C., attended by President George W. Bush and Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez. Gerber Scientific, Inc. is divided into four businesses: • Gerber Technology (GT) is the largest business of GSI (accounting for 2/3 of revenues). It has been providing hardware and software systems to automate and manage the product design and manufacturing process with CAD software for pattern design, automated material spreading systems and computer-controlled cutting systems. The company serves 25,000 customers, including more than 100 Fortune 500 companies, in the aerospace, apparel, retail, composites, packaging, furniture, technical textiles and transportation interiors industries in 130 countries. Gerber Innovations, a business of Gerber Technology, is North America’s only full-line manufacturer of automated cutting hardware for the design, die making and short-run production segments of the packaging industry. • Virtek Vision International, an Ontario, Canada-based business acquired by Gerber in Sept. 2008 for $33.1 million, serves aerospace carbon fiber composite part assembly, sheet metal part fabrication and construction markets with laser templating, quality inspection and spatial positioning systems. • Gerber’s Yunique Solutions business, acquired by Gerber in Dec. 2009, and based in New York City, offers YuniquePLM product lifecycle management software. This web-based system helps retailers, brand owners and manufacturers manage all of the details associated with their products from conception to store shelf and helps them communicate with their suppliers. Users of this software include Abercrombie & Fitch, Fruit of the Loom, Aeropostale, Merrell, and Cutter & Buck, among others. • Gerber Scientific Products (GSP) develops and manufactures computerized sign making and specialty graphics systems, software, materials, and accessories to provide sign shops and graphics professionals with solutions for vinyl-cutting, digital color printing and dimensional signage needs. GSP also develops and supplies aftermarket materials."

  "text" : "Gate Gourmet is an airline catering firm with headquarters on the grounds of Zürich Airport, Switzerland, near Zürich. Gate Gourmet was founded in 1992, and is the world's largest independent airline catering, hospitality and logistics company. As a part of parent company gategroup, the company has substantially expanded its products and services recently through acquisitions and strategic investments. The portfolio now includes cabin service ware (deSter); comfort/entertainment items (Harmony); packaged food components assembled in central production units (Supplair); aviation services such as cabin cleaning, aircraft washing and de-icing and passenger services (Gate Aviation [formerly Fernley/IAS - see below]); catering security (Gate Safe); business applications (eGate Solutions) and supply chain optimization (partnership with Pourshins). As of 2015, it had 28,000 employees and posted revenue of 3.1 billion Swiss Francs. Some of its clients are British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, LAN Airlines, Air Algérie, Air Canada, Air Transat, American Airlines, United Airlines, Qantas Airways, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Avianca, Iberia Airlines, Air China, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Emirates Airline, Thai Airways International, Swiss International Air Lines, TAM Airlines, Airblue, Air Indus, Shaheen Air International, Amtrak and EasyJet. Gate Gourmet's roots are in Swissair. For a long time, Gate Gourmet was considered Swissair's \"Crown Jewel\". The company was worth roughly 6 billion Swiss Francs before the September 11 attacks and the bankruptcy of Swissair. The rise of oil prices and collapse in consumer travel damaged the airlines and many of Gate Gourmet's main customers went bankrupt or narrowly avoided bankruptcy. The weakness of the airlines affected the industries that cater to or support it. This eventually set the stage for Swissair's crown jewel requiring a restructuring effort, which soon burdened its employees. The company was then sold in 2002 to Texas Pacific Group for USD $870 million, and later its ownership became known as gategroup."

  "text" : "Griffin Technology is a privately held U.S. company founded in Nashville, Tennessee in 1992 by Paul Griffin. The company designs and manufactures computer peripherals, consumer electronics, and accessories for smartphones and mobile devices. The company's first products were primarily video adapters, in particular those to enable the connection of DB-15 based Macintosh computers to the more popular VGA based monitors of the time. June 1998 marked Griffin's entry into USB based computer peripherals with the introduction of the iMate, a device that allowed the use of Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) based devices with the newer, and increasingly more common, Universal Serial Bus (USB). Griffin introduced additional USB devices, such as iMic and PowerMate, over the next two years, and continued to enjoy moderate growth during this period. Griffin was one of the first 3rd-party vendors to produce peripherals for Apple's iPod. One year after iPod came out, at MacWorld San Francisco 2003, Griffin introduced iTrip. iTrip is an FM transmitter that allows iPod owners to transmit audio from an iPod to a nearby FM receiver. The company experienced rapid growth fueled by the success of its iPod accessories, especially the iTrip. As evidence, the number of people employed by Griffin Technology increased four-fold between 2003 and 2007. This growth allowed the company to take on more ambitious projects such as the Evolve wireless speaker system, and to diversify the product line to include accessories for iPod competitors such as  Microsoft's Zune, and  SanDisk's Sansa. At present, the company's accessories line-up includes those for Apple's iOS devices, as well as popular smartphones, tablets, and handheld devices from Google, Amazon, Samsung, HTC, and Motorola. Products range from protective cases for these devices, to consumer electronics and accessories for audio performance and playback, remote-controlled model cars and helicopters, consumer electronics accessories for children, and products for retail and healthcare markets. Griffin Technology currently employs 350+ employees, world-wide. In 2014, Griffin became one of the first Nashville companies to become a naming partner at a career academy of a local high school. The Griffin Academy of Design and Technology is located at Hunters Lane High School of Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools."

JD Powers ranked Global Van Lines highest in the Long-Distance Segment with a score of 774, performing particularly well in loading service, packing service, and optional coverage.

Following interest from the City of Darebin, the service was extended to Melbourne under the name \"GoGet\" in November 2004. With the growth of the service to other areas in Sydney, Newtown CarShare was renamed GoGet in May 2005. GoGet members choose a rate plan and pay an annual fee. Fees cover fuel, insurance, maintenance, and cleaning. The vehicles are mostly late-model hatchbacks, but also include vans, utes and premium vehicles. Each vehicle has a home location, referred to as a \"pod\", either in a car park or on a street, typically in a highly populated urban neighborhood. Members reserve a car by web or telephone and use a key card to access the vehicle. GoGet is an invented word which reflects the utility you get from using, rather than owning, a car. As in 'Go get the shopping, go get the kids.' In June 2014, GoGet had over 1300 vehicles Australia-wide. In October 2015, GoGet had over 65,000 members, which is estimated to take 100,000 cars off the road."

In either case, its ambition is to find new opportunities that could become “an incubator” of strategic assets over the long term. Ultimately, this investment category could represent between 10% and 15% of the group’s adjusted net assets. GBL therefore continued to purchase Umicore shares in 2014 and 2015 and became its largest shareholder with a 13.1% interest at 30 June 2015.

The company was originally founded and headquartered in Scranton, Pennsylvania, eventually moving to Brooklyn, New York in the early 20th century. Grand Union moved again to Elmwood Park, New Jersey and finally to Wayne, New Jersey before the original company was forced into Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 and sold to C&S Wholesale Grocers. After C&S bought Grand Union it down-scaled most of its operations and exited its primary marketplace, choosing to keep only a number of stores in upstate New York and New England open. The chain was sold to Tops Friendly Markets in 2012, and in 2013 Tops rebranded the remaining stores with their logo and the Grand Union name ceased to exist."

In the first half of 2011 premium income made up 63.99% of total revenue up from 56.07% hoh. The hyphen in the company's name was originally a typesetter's error. For the three months ended June 2013, 63% of revenue originated in Canada, 26% from the US, 10% from Europe. Group retirement products (Canadian sales up 49%) and 401k markets (US Great West Financial sales up 34%) remain key areas of growth for the company. Lower UK wealth management single premiums negatively affected growth. Boston-based Putnam Investments accounts for nearly a quarter of all assets under administration. Approximately half of company profit comes from Canada, a third from Europe and the rest of the United States.In the third quarter of 2010 British sales outpaced all other regions with 45% growth followed by the USA financial services business (up 41%). In 2q2011 earthquakes affected payout rates in Europe. In 2009 100% owned subsidiary London Life ranked 14th among Canada's largest private companies."

Subscribers could also buy selected DVDs or games at a reduced price, should they choose to keep the movie or game. GameZnFlix also acted as a traditional online retailer and offered new copies of DVDs and video games for sale. Circuit City (now defunct) offered one month prepaid subscriptions of GameZnFlix for new customers, and gift certificates that could be sent to friends and family."

  "text" : "Genome Valley is an Indian high-technology business district spread across 600 km² in Hyderabad, India. Centered across the suburbs Shamirpet, Medchal, Uppal, Patancheru, Jeedimetla, Gachibowli and Keesara, the Valley has developed as a cluster for Biomedical research, training and manufacturing. Genome valley was commissioned in 1999 as S. P. Biotech Park in a public-private partnership with Bharat Biotech International, and its founder Krishna Ella, alongside private infrastructure companies such as Shapoorji Pallonji Group and ICICI Bank. In 2009, U.S. based infrastructure giant Alexandria Real Estate Equities has announced its plans to invest in the bio-cluster, which led to the Alexandria Knowledge Park SEZ. The biocluster at Shamirpet holds Certification mark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the European Union. The IKP Knowledge Park spread over 200 acres in Turakapally, is an initiative of ICICI Bank with five \"innovation corridors\" - a first of its kind knowledge-nurturing centre for Indian companies and a knowledge gateway for multinational companies\". The first phase of Innovation Corridor I, comprising 10 laboratories, around 3,000 ft² (300 m²) each, is operational and fully occupied. The second phase of Innovation Corridor I, comprising 16 laboratory modules of 1,700 ft² (170 m²) each, is ready for operation. The Alexandria Knowledge Park spread over 300 acres in Turakapally, accommodates advance research and development infrastructure in multiple formats like multi-tenanted research buildings, incubation facilities, build-to-suit blocks and industrial plots. The Park has been developed in two phases. Phase I covers approximately 145 acres and Phase II covers approximately 162 acres of land. The Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, SEZ, the Lonza Group, SEZ, and Alexandria SEZ, are the designated special economic zones of the Valley."

It was owned by Jan Cameron's Retail Adventures along with Sam's Warehouse, Crazy Clark's and Chickenfeed stores. The company was sold by Miller's retail to Australian discount retail in 2005. The chain's parent company, Australian Discount Retail, went into receivership in January 2009 after owing $201 million to creditors. Recently the company and the other 3 chains of stores owned by Australian Discount Retail have been bought by Jan Cameron under the company name Retail Adventures. Retail Adventures previously announced that they will be abandoning the \"Go-Lo\" brand name. Over the next 5 years, all stores owned by Retail Adventures will be re-branded and refitted as \"Chickenfeed\" based on the company's Tasmanian chain of discount stores. However, on 27 October 2012 parent company Retail Adventures Pty Ltd went into administration. Owner Jan Cameron will continue to operate the business with a licence from the administrators. The Chickenfeed rebranding has ceased, and any profitable Go-Lo stores will be rebranded as Crazy Clark's."

  "text" : "GSC Game World is a Ukrainian video game developer based in Kiev, Ukraine. Founded in 1995 by Hryhorovych Serhiy, it is best known for the Cossacks and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series of games. Their first game was the 2000 Cossacks: European Wars, which directly led to their breakthrough. In 2004, GSC Game World opened their publishing arm, GSC World Publishing, which would publish and distribute their titles in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Their next successful series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., started with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl on 20 March 2007, and was followed up with two sequels in 2008 and 2009, respectively. In September 2009, they announced that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series would be ported to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, however, due to a lack of manpower, they instead shifted to the development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, which later got stuck in development hell. On 9 December 2011, GSC Game World was officially dissolved, and, in March 2012, a new studio, Vostok Games, was opened by former GSC Game World staff to produce a free-to-play first-person shooter, which would later become Survarium. In June 2012, a controversial new studio, Union Studio, was formed, which falsely claimed to employ former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developers. The studio renamed itself to West-Games and opened a Kickstarter campaign, looking for US$50,000 to produce Areal, a spiritual successor to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. After reaching US$64,928, two weeks before the funding closed, the campaing was suspended by Kickstarter, stating contract violation. It was later revealed that West-Games acted out fraud, having employed no former GSC Game World staff and tried to crowdfund a now cancelled Adobe Flash game. On 22 December 2014, GSC Game World officially reopened and picked up development on a new game. On 18 May 2015, GSC Game World announced Cossacks 3, which will be a remake of their real-time strategy classic, scheduled for release on 20 September 2016."

  "text" : "Griffon Aerospace is an aerospace and defense company based in Madison, Alabama, United States. Established in 1995 by Larry French, the company was formed to design, develop, and manufacture a manned composite kit aircraft. Griffon's first aircraft was the single engined six seat Lionheart. The design and development began at Larry's home in Harvest, Alabama where he worked designing and developing a composite aircraft formed around the Pratt & Whitney R-985 450 horsepower radial engine. The staggerwing design pays compliment to the classic Beechcraft 17 Staggerwing. Pre-sales of the Lionheart took place in 1995 and 1996 at the annual Experimental Aircraft Show at Oshkosh. Lionheart's first flight was 28 July 1997 and 48 hours later it flew into Oshkosh. The aircraft was featured on the cover of the October 1997 Kit Planes Magazine. Enough orders were placed for Larry French to take on Griffon Aerospace as his full-time occupation. The company moved into a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) facility at 901 Nick Fitchard in Huntsville. Griffon also gained some investors who provided working capital for the new company. In 2002, Griffon began to expand into composite structures for NASA applications through a subcontract with Northrop Grumman for composite cyrogenic tanks. During that same time period, Griffon also began designing a prototype 130 pound gross weight unmanned aircraft eventually designated the MQM-170A Outlaw. In February 2003, Griffon submitted a proposal in response to the US Army AMCOM Remotely Piloted Vehicle Target (RPVT) offering and Griffon was awarded the RPVT contract in August 2003. A few months later Lockheed awarded Griffon a large contract to build a full-scale composite Crew Capsule. In 2004, the addition of the US Army's new five-year RPVT production contract allowed Griffon Aerospace to expand, producing between 50 and 80 Outlaw aircraft per month at one point. Griffon also put together flight crews to fly the unmanned aircraft for the US Army and foreign military customers. As of 2012 Griffon has produced over 3,000 unmanned aircraft and has flown over 110,000 sorties and maintained a loss rate under 1%. In 2009, Griffon Aerospace won the recompete for the Outlaw MQM-170A. Also in 2009, Griffon was awarded a sole-source contract for the MQM-171A Broadsword a 600-pound gross weight unmanned aircraft. Also in 2009, the US Navy also awarded Griffon Aerospace a contract for the manufacture, operation, and maintenance of a modified version of the Outlaw MQM-170A, as of 2012, Griffon has delivered 500 US Navy aircraft. In August 2012, Griffon was awarded a large id/iq contract for aerial target services with US Army Target Management Office. Griffon was awarded the Northrop Supplier of the Year for 2009 for its advanced composite work on the NASA MLAS program. In October 2012, Griffon was awarded a multimillion-dollar subcontract from Northrop Grumman to build a sub-scale tank for a NASA risk reduction program. Griffon introduced its Outlaw G2 Aircraft at the 2012 AUVSI show in Las Vegas. The G2 aircraft will replace the current MQM-170A model aircraft. \n* Griffon Display at Oshkosh \n* Griffon Composite Capsule during test \n* BroadSword rollout In April 2010, Griffon Aerospace and US Army officials rolled out their second UAV system, the BroadSword"

  "text" : "The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (GNR(I) or GNRI) was an Irish gauge (1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in)) railway company in Ireland. The Great Northern was formed in 1876 by a merger of the Irish North Western Railway (INW), Northern Railway of Ireland, and Ulster Railway. The Ulster Railway was the GNRI's oldest constituent, having opened between Belfast and Lisburn in 1839 and extended in stages to reach Clones in 1863. The Northern Railway of Ireland was itself formed by a merger of the Dublin and Drogheda Railway (D&D) with the Dublin and the Belfast Junction Railway (D&BJct). The Ulster, D&D and D&BJct railways together formed the main line between Dublin and Belfast, with the D&BJct completing the final section in 1852 to join the Ulster at Portadown. The GNRI's other main lines were between Derry and Dundalk and between Omagh and Portadown. The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway together with the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway enabled GNRI trains between Derry and Belfast to compete with the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, and both this and the Dundalk route gave connections between Derry and Dublin. These main lines supported the development of an extensive branch network serving the southwest half of Ulster and northern counties of Leinster. The GNRI became Ireland's most prosperous railway company and second largest railway network. In its early years the GNR(I) closely imitated the image of its English namesake, adopting an apple green livery for its steam locomotives and a varnished teak finish for its passenger coaches. Later the company adopted its famous pale blue livery for locomotives (from 1932), with the frames and running gear picked out in scarlet. Passenger vehicles were painted brown, instead of varnished."

  "text" : "Goodyear Aerospace Corporation was the aerospace and defense subsidiary of Goodyear. The company was originally operated as a division within Goodyear as part of a joint project with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, leading to the famous Goodyear Blimps. As part of the failing relationship between the US and Germany in the pre-war era, the division was spun off as Goodyear Aircraft Company 1939. In 1941 they opened a new factory in Arizona where they produced subassemblies, including subcontracted airframe construction and the design of the Goodyear F2G Corsair and Goodyear Duck. In the post-war era, the division began to diversify and made major contributions to the development of synthetic aperture radar. In 1963 they became Goodyear Aerospace, with major product lines in radar, aircraft canopies, bulletproof glass, a number of spacecraft related products, and the unique Goodyear Inflatoplane. A 1986 hostile takeover attempt of the parent company by James Goldsmith led to a massive restructuring to build capital to buy Goldsmith out. Goodyear Aerospace was sold to Loral in 1987, which in turn sold their non-satellite operations with the defense products purchased by Lockheed Martin in 1993."

  "text" : "The Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is the nonprofit applied research arm of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. GTRI employs around 1,765 people, and is involved in approximately $305 million in research annually for more than 200 clients in industry and government. Initially known as the Engineering Experiment Station, (EES) the organization was proposed in 1929 by W. Harry Vaughan as an analogue to the agricultural experiment stations; the Georgia General Assembly passed a law that year creating the organization on paper, but did not allocate funds to start it. To boost the state's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression, funds were found, and the station was finally established with US$5,000 (equivalent to $530,000 in 2015) in April 1934. GTRI's research spans a variety of disciplines, including national defense, homeland security, public health, education, mobile and wireless technologies, and economic development. Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies, the state of Georgia, non-defense federal agencies, and private industry. Overall, contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI's total research funding. Since it was established, GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science, economics, policy, and other areas that leverage GTRI's partnership with Georgia Tech. GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents."

  "text" : "Good Earth Tea is a tea and herbal tea company. Founded in 1972 under the name Fmali Herb Company based in Santa Cruz, California, it was one of the first American herbal tea companies during the early 1970s. In the late 1970s it began to develop trademark teas for Good Earth Restaurants, and launched Good Earth teas in tea bag form to the California grocery market in 1988. Since their inception, Good Earth Tea quickly became a countrywide favorite with the introduction of Sweet & Spicy, a signature blend of sweet and warming herbs and spices. Good Earth Tea has since evolved to include a wide range of teas made with natural ingredients and span all sorts of varietals, herbs, botanicals and flavors. Good Earth was acquired by Tetley US Holdings Limited in October 2005, and is a subsidiary of Tata Global Beverages. In January 2011, Tata Global Beverages shut down production of Good Earth in Santa Cruz, putting 47 people out of work, and moved the operations to New Jersey. In 2011 & 2012 Good Earth Tea launched the \"Tag, You're It Contest\", a nationwide contest offering fans a chance to submit an original, thought-provoking quote to be used on the tea tags of the brand's flavorful blends. In November 2013, Tata Global Beverages rebranded Good Earth to diversify it in the competitive tea market. The new \"Untamed Tea\" brand message and marketing strategy redesigned the brand's Web site, launched extensive social media outreach and celebrity chef partnership. It also included new flavors with new taste profiles, some with Stevia, and discontinued older flavors. In January 2014 Good Earth Tea collaborated with celebrity chef Elizabeth Falkner from Bravo's Top Chef. Chef Falkner's adventurous palate led to the creation of recipes infused with Good Earth Tea. Facebook fans had an opportunity to enter the \"Taste The Tea Untamed Sweepstakes\" for a chance to meet Chef Falkner and embark on a culinary excursion. Good Earth produced over 40 different blends of tea, now concentrating on 14 unique teas. Good Earth teas are available in natural and organic varieties."

  "text" : "GTM Cars is a component kit car manufacturer located in Kingswinford, UK. The company was founded in 1967 when Bernard Cox and his friend Jack Hosker created the Cox GTM (Grand Touring Mini) a mid engined Ferrari Dino-inspired sports car based on Mini parts. It was an instant hit and they built kits as fast as they could in their garage in Hazel Grove, Stockport. In the autumn of 1968, Bernard Cox decided to stop production after 50 kits. Production was taken over by Howard Heerey, who had raced a GTM, and his father who renamed the car to simply GTM. The design evolved over time and by 1971 about 170 kits had been made and they were up to GTM 1-3 (model 1, variation 3). But in 1972 the road outside their garage had to be widened and they were forced to close. In 1972 a fibreglass company in Hartlepool bought the demonstrator car, moulds, jigs and spares, but they never produced any cars. Instead the GTM project was bought by KMB Autosports in 1976. They made spares for existing cars, but no new kits. In 1980 GTM entered its by far most successful era when it was bought by Peter Beck, Paddy Fitch and Dougal Cowper, the latter departing relatively soon after. The company moved to Sutton Bonington in 1982 and over the next 20 years they refined the GTM Coupe, as it became known and developed a succession of new models. The Rossa was another Mini based car with more modern styling and was followed by the Mk2. With the introduction of the Rover 'K'-series engine, GTM were quick to fit one in their third generation Rossa which was launched as simply the 'K3', the first vehicle to be made available with a mid-mounted 'K'-series (subsequently followed by Lotus' Elise, MG's own MGF and Ariel's Atom to name but three). In 1998, following three years in development, Beck and Fitch launched a more up-market sports model, the Richard Oakes designed Libra. This was followed up four years later with the Spyder, a more softly styled convertible bearing some of the same styling cues as the Libra, but sharing few panels. In 2003 GTM Cars was bought by RDM Group, and in 2004 the company moved to Coventry. Once under RDM's management, GTM developed two new cars. The Ballista, a light reworking of the Larini VW-based kit car and a 'skeletal' track car - the 40TR - based on the fibreglass monocoque tub of the Spyder. Neither car progressed past the development stage, and GTM continued to focus on the Libra and Spyder selling them in either kit or complete factory built forms. In December 2007 GTM Cars Ltd., came under the new ownership of the parent company Potenza Sports Cars, owners of Westfield Sportscars. January 2008 saw GTM Cars appear at the Autosport Show with a newly redeveloped 40TR, although 40TR development has been postponed in favour of development on the Ballista project. GTM Cars again featured on the Westfield/Potenza stand at the National Kitcar Show at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire on the May Bank Holiday weekend 2009 in the shape of a Red Spyder. For sale as an ex-demonstrator, the car was unpolished and even showed a fair amount of road debris, a far cry from some of the stunning cars shown by the company in previous years. However, Potenza also made clear that the cars would be rebranded as Westfield GTM rather than as a marque in their own right. In late January 2010, Westfield Sportscars made the following announcement.\"Unfortunately due to parts procurement issues we are no longer offering the current range of GTM models.We will however over the next 12 months be designing and manufacturing a new GTM.\""

  "text" : "The Garment District is a clothing retailer in Cambridge, Massachusetts that opened in 1986 and houses an eclectic array of vintage and contemporary clothing. The Garment District is also known for its Dollar-A-Pound clothing store. Founded in the 1940s, the company produced \"wiping clothes\" (i.e. rags) to smokestack industries, such as sugar manufacturing. The Garment District began as an offshoot of Harbor Textiles. In 1979 as demand began to rise for used clothing Dollar-A-Pound was opened, where one could buy clothing by the pound. Instead of cutting used clothing up for wiping cloths it was now sold as fashion, though without racks or price tags. In the 1980s finding large quantities of vintage 1940s and 50s clothing at Dollar-A-Pound was commonplace. In 1986 as the demand for used and vintage clothing continued to rise The Garment District was born. Now in addition to Dollar-A-Pound both new & used clothing is sold on racks - traditional style. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of clothing are still sorted on site. In 2004 The Garment District was under threat of closure. The pressure to turn the buildings into residential condos almost succeeded. With help from the City of Cambridge, among others, The Garment District was able to acquire the buildings. In 2007 The Garment District merged with Boston Costume."

  "text" : "Gainward is a computer hardware company which produces video cards. Taiwan-based TNC Industrial sold the company to Palit Microsystems in 2005, acquiring the Gainward brand and branch Gainward Europe GmbH for $1 million. Their graphic cards used to be exclusively based on Nvidia chipsets; however, the company also announced ATI-based graphics solutions after the successful launch of ATI 4800-series hardware, although Gainward does not currently produce any cards from the ATI Radeon range. Gainward products are famous for their overclockability. The company has also released cards that deviate from the reference specifications set forth by Nvidia. Gainward is well known for their Golden Sample range of graphics cards. These cards are overclocked past their stock speeds and tested before they are sold, to ensure quality for customers. Current examples of Golden Sample cards are; Nvidia GTS 450, GTX 460 and GTX 470. At one stage Golden Sample cards came with a game voucher that let the customer choose one game as an online download. Current cards come prepackaged with a game. There was a gap in which the company did not produce any new products, but resumed manufacturing with the Nvidia 8800 GTS series which brought them back up to date with other companies such as Gigabyte and PNY Technologies. Gainward have had success with their \"Phantom\" series of high end graphics, featuring an industry first \"removable fan design\" has put the company in a good competitive position. The non-reference design cards are designed to be cooler and quieter than reference boards and run much faster due to factory overclocking. A game voucher is also present, with an option to download a single game as opposed to the prepackaged hard copy."

  "text" : "Green Shield Stamps was a British sales promotion scheme that rewarded shoppers with stamps that could be used to buy gifts from a catalogue or from any affiliated retailer. The scheme was introduced in 1958 by Richard Tompkins, who had noticed the success of the long-established Sperry & Hutchinson Green Stamps in America. For a few years, the scheme was so widely adopted that it was referenced in pop songs. But it suffered when Tesco ceased to use it, as part of a price-cutting policy that became standard nationwide. To retain business, Green Shield allowed customers to buy gifts from the catalogue with a mix of stamps and cash, but soon the catalogue became cash-only, and the operation was re-branded as Argos. Stamps were withdrawn altogether in 1991."

Ground Round was well known in the 1970s and 1980s for its children's parties, showing old time silent movies and cartoons on a big screen, a mascot named Bingo the Clown, and for passing out whole peanuts where diners were not discouraged from throwing the shells on the floor, which became one of The Ground Round's more endearing qualities that attracted families with small children; they also often gave diners popcorn with their dinner, rather than bread. The newest incarnation of Ground Round doesn't support such behavior and markets to the adult dining and cocktails crowd, although families are still welcome (a mascot called the Ground Round Hound, an anthropomorphic hound dog, appears on the kids' menu). In February 2004 the franchisor for Ground Round filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; in the process, all 59 corporate-owned restaurants (almost half of the Ground Rounds then open) abruptly closed their doors. A group of franchisees joined together in order to buy out the parent company, at the time Ground Round, Inc., and started the Ground Round Independent Owners Cooperative, LLC (GR IOC)."

François Goyard (1828–1890) made box making, packing and trunk making the family’s trade when he purchased Maison Morel, successor to Maison Martin. Edmond Goyard (1860–1937) expanded his business from 1885 to 1937. Robert Goyard (1893–1979) was the face of the brand during the booming post-war years. François Goyard played a significant role in further increasing the firm’s growth with his daughter Isabelle Goyard (1959-). Jean-Michel Signoles bought Goyard in 1998, and turned the privately-owned company into an internationally renowned brand. The brand is known for a certain amount of secrecy, eschewing self-promotion, advertising, or e-commerce, and refusing to grant interviews."

  "text" : "Gyldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag A/S, usually referred to simply as Gyldendal (Danish pronunciation: [ˈɡylˀəndæˀl]; Nasdaq Copenhagen: GYLD A, GYLD B) is a Danish publishing house. Founded in 1770 by Søren Gyldendal, it is the oldest and largest publishing house in Denmark, offering a wide selection of books including fiction, non-fiction and dictionaries. Prior to 1925, it was also the leading publishing house in Norway, and it published all of Henrik Ibsen's works. In 1925, a Norwegian publishing house named Gyldendal Norsk Forlag (\"Gyldendal Norwegian Publishing House\") was founded, having bought rights to Norwegian authors from Gyldendal. Gyldendal is a public company and its shares are traded on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Gyldendal stopped the print version of their encyclopedia in 2006, focusing instead on selling paid subscriptions for its online encyclopedia. By 2008 it had decided that it needed another approach to support that online site. Since February 2009 Gyldendal is publishing an online, subscription-free encyclopedia, which currently has close to 200000 articles in Danish."

  "text" : "Goodmans is a British consumer electronics company which is part of Harvard International. Founded in London, in 1925, the company started as a manufacturer of loudspeakers for public address systems. Production and engineering was based in Wembley and latterly in Havant, Hampshire. They developed a wide range of high performance drivers and electrical components, introducing a number of innovative products such as the Axiom, Audiomax Range  and M-Range Maxims (which were stated at the time as being the world's first true high fidelity bookshelf loudspeaker). From the 1960s Goodmans extended their product into amplifiers with the introduction of the Maxamp30, the first British made solid state amplifier. Throughout the 70s and 80s Goodmans continued to develop loudspeakers, amplifiers, tuners and receivers. Vintage Goodmans of England speakers are renowned for their warm, rich, detailed sound. From the late 1980s Goodmans diversified into wider consumer electronics and were market leaders in various product categories including In-Car Entertainment, Personal CD, Digital TV and Freeview and Freesat Digital TV receivers and recorders. Goodmans was the shirt sponsor of the English football team Portsmouth F.C. from 1989 to 1995. In 2015 Goodmans modernised their logo and introduced a squirrel icon within their branding."

  "text" : "Galpin Auto Sports (or GAS) is an American automobile dealership and automobile repair shop located in Van Nuys which specializes in customizing and remodeling vehicles specifically for their drivers. They also provide spare parts. The shop was founded in 1946 by Frank Galpin and later purchased by Bert Boeckmann. Galpin Auto Sports is the car garage featured on MTV's Pimp My Ride hosted by Xzibit. The show was moved from West Coast Customs to GAS in the 5th and 6th season. They also own a second-hand car shop. On site at the main garage is an extensive array of customized cars which can be bought direct from the garage. GAS's work can also be seen on the new television show Knight Rider. They were asked to create the star of the show, a new version of the 2008 Ford Mustang called the GT500KR. \"GAS had one week to create the new KITT, and they pulled out all the stops. Six people worked full time to create the Mustang that would be sent over to Picture Car Warehouse as the father of all the KITT derivatives and stunt cars.\" \"Galpinized\" custom-designed vehicles have won national attention and awards. Galpin Motors is the number one volume Ford dealership in the world, and \"the top California car dealer(s) with more than $700 million in annual sales\", including well-known auto brands such as Ford, Lincoln, Mazda, Jaguar, Volvo, Aston Martin, Lotus, Honda and Subaru."

  "text" : "GrandPa's or GrandPa Pidgeon's was a discount store founded in 1954 by Tom and Mildred Pidgeon, spreading across the midwest from its Bridgeton, Missouri (near St. Louis) origins, which remained truly \"discount\", when most others like Venture, Kmart and Target gradually raised prices in order to finance a more attractive layout and broader range of merchandise. Tom Pidgeon, born in Sebring, Ohio in 1902, was in the low price china business from the early 1930s to the early 1950s. He sold his company, Pidgeon Vitrified China in 1953 when he foresaw the impact plastic was having on the lower end dinnerware market. The first Grandpa Pidgeon's was opened in February 1954 and managed by his son-in-law, John (Jack) Holley, born in 1924 in Galena, Kansas.In 1958 Jack Holley began a separate but related enterprise known as Grandpa's, and opened a store on Collinsville Road between East St. Louis and Collinsville, Illinois. Over the next decade, Holley subsequently opened several other stores in the St. Louis metropolitan area, before buying the company outright from his father-in-law in 1968. Holley formed the Gramex Corporation in 1970, which also oversaw such companies as Forsythe Computers and Omni Sports, which was forced to close due to increasing competition. In 1986 Jack Holley retired and turned the company over to his oldest son Tom Holley, who presided over an expansion both within and outside the metro St. Louis area into locations such as Greenville, Illinois and Farmington, Missouri, among other places. By the late 1990s there were thirteen Grandpa's locations. GrandPa's was sold, in 1999, to Value City. It had approximately $200,000,000 in sales in its final year. It was profitable until its sale, failing to end only 1993 in the black, but was said to be facing a harder struggle near the end. The company was known for their newspaper distributed advertising circulars that were printed mostly with black ink on a brown paper, in contrast to the glossy full color circulars of competitors. In October 2008, a former Grandpa's employee started a website as a gathering place for all former GrandPa's, GrandPa Pidgeon's, and Gramex employees. It is a place for them to re-connect with old friends and share stories of your time at GrandPa's. It used to be at: www.grandpasreunion.com, but is no longer in operation."

The company is wholly native owned and is fully licensed by the federal government as a tobacco manufacturer. Tobacco on reserve is a new economy that has brought employment and opportunities resulting in healthy and sustainable communities. The spinoff effects of GRE has created over 1,000 jobs on first nations communities. The company was sued in March 2013 by New York State, which alleged that it was selling untaxed cigarettes to retailers in New York. The suit alleges that the sales violated the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act and the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act, as well as state tax and health laws. The Six Nations Council continues to advocate that the millions of dollars paid by GRE to the federal government should be directly reinvested into the community since more taxes are paid by GRE compared to the annual transfer payment provided by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. GRE is facing a new battle due to counterfeiting of its products. The company has called on First Nations communities to put regulations in place that manufacturers can turn to when their tobacco products are counterfeited."

Chef Peter Gordon, a New Zealand-born, London-based chef, oversaw the menu development and the first restaurant opened in 2001, bringing the concept of 'gourmet burgers' to London. GBK is known for its large burgers, fresh produce and casual service style. The initial success of the Battersea restaurant led to further openings across London. In 2005, the owners sold the business to Clapham House Group PLC  who added a total of 53 restaurants across the UK. In 2010 the restaurant chain was sold to Capricorn Ventures, most notable for operating Nando's. GBK expanded to 60 restaurants across the UK, and has plans to continue growing. Franchises operate in Ireland, Dubai, Greece and Oman. There is a subtle Kiwi theme throughout the restaurants, a reference to the heritage of the original owners."

  "text" : "GE Appliances & Lighting, (formally known as GE Consumer & Industrial), is an American manufacturer, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. GE Appliances & Lighting is a subsidiary of conglomerate General Electric and is one of the largest suppliers of appliances in the world. It was created in January 2004 when GE Consumer Products (founded in 1905) merged with GE Industrial Systems (founded in 1930). From 2010 to late 2014, GE Appliances & Lighting was a sub-business under GE Home & Business Solutions. On 8 September 2014, General Electric agreed to sell GE Appliances & Lighting to the Swedish appliance manufacturer Electrolux for US$3.3 billion in cash. The Electrolux acquisition was the result of General Electric's nearly six-year-long plan to sell the Appliance & Lighting division that included negotiations with Electrolux and other firms, such as Samsung and LG. The deal will combine Electrolux's existing primary U.S. mainstream appliance brand, Frigidaire, with GE's stable of products, including the Monogram line of luxury appliances. As part of the deal, Electrolux agreed to continue using the G.E. Appliances brand names, such as the mainstream \"GE\" appliance marque, for a limited period, and also agreed to assume General Electric's 48.4% stake in Mabe, a Mexican appliance manufacturer. The transaction — the largest ever for Electrolux, the second-largest consumer appliance manufacturer after Whirlpool — would have nearly doubled Electrolux's business in North America (the market that represented nearly 29% of Electrolux's revenue in 2013). The deal carried a US$175 million termination fee clause if Electrolux was unable to complete the acquisition. It was terminated in December 2015 due to regulatory concerns. GE announced in early 2016 that Chinese appliance conglomerate Haier will purchase the appliance division for $5.4 billion."

  "text" : "Grindhouse Releasing is a Hollywood-based independent cult film distribution company led by film editor Bob Murawski and co-founded by the late Sage Stallone. Grindhouse digitally remasters, restores, and produces bonus materials and video documentaries for cult film DVDs and Blu-rays which it distributes on the CAV label. Grindhouse focuses on the distribution of rare and little-seen independent cult films. Releases have included The Swimmer, a surreal drama featuring Burt Lancaster; The Big Gundown, a spaghetti western with Lee Van Cleef; and Corruption, a British film starring Peter Cushing. Grindhouse was the first company to digitally remaster and restore the stylish Italian horror films from the 1970s and 1980s such as Cannibal Ferox (Make Them Die Slowly), Lucio Fulci's The Beyond (E tu vivrai nel terrore), as well as the notorious cult classic Cannibal Holocaust directed by Ruggero Deodato. The company also restored and coordinated a limited theatrical re-release of American filmmaker Sam Raimi's cult classic The Evil Dead. The company has been called the \"Criterion\" of cult film distribution, employing the highest standards for quality and deluxe bonus materials on their Blu-ray and DVD releases. Coco Hames of the Nashville Scene says of the company: \"A Grindhouse release has a rotgut seal of approval, whether it's the kind of gore epic that once played grimy 42nd Street cinemas (Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust), an overlooked Hollywood rarity (Frank Perry's The Swimmer), or a long-lost movie by an obsessive auteur that never saw the light of day (Duke Mitchell's Gone with the Pope)\". Grindhouse Releasing was awarded the 2015 International Press Academy's Satellite Award for \"Outstanding Overall Blu-Ray/DVD\" for its Blu-ray release and restoration of Frank Perry's cult film, The Swimmer."

  "text" : "Gus Mayer is a Birmingham, Alabama based, family-owned, upscale specialty department store that caters to upper-end clientele and is known for its high-end fashions. The two-store chain is owned by the Pizitz Management Group. It has locations at the Colonial Brookwood Village in the Greater Birmingham area and The Mall at Green Hills in Nashville, both of which are known as high-end retail centers. Typical brands carried include 7 for all Mankind, Juicy Couture, Dolce & Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, Gianfranco Ferré, Michael Kors, Zang Toi, Zac Posen, Lela Rose, St. John, Monique Lhuillier, and Burberry. It was founded in 1900; the original Gus Mayer department store was located on Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. At one time, there were more than 20 Gus Mayer stores across the Southeast and Southwest. The first Birmingham location opened in 1922 in the Retail Block behind the Molton Hotel on 5th Avenue North. Later the store was located at 2240 Highland Avenue in the Bottega Favorita location, now home to Bottega Restaurant & Cafe. Two years after the Brookwood Village mall opened in 1973 the store moved there. In 1975, when the stores were being sold off individually, the Pizitz family purchased the Birmingham operation and later added the Nashville location. These two are the only remaining Gus Mayer stores today. In 2002 the Colonial Brookwood Village store was relocated and expanded along with the renovations to the mall. Hambrecht Oleson Design Associates of New York designed the new 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) store with local architects Crawford, McWilliams and Hatcher. The shoe salons at Gus Mayer, which include a full-line Stuart Weitzman boutique and a Cole Haan concept salon, are owned independently by David Kraselsky, who leases the store space. In 2010 the Gus Mayer at Colonial Brookwood Village made plans to move to The Summit as part of an updating of the store's merchandising strategy sometime around Valentine's Day, 2011.. The new 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) store was also designed by Hambrecht Oleson. Bayer Properties petitioned the City of Birmingham for $500,000 in tax abatement incentives for the deal.[edit]"

  "text" : "Gracenote, Inc. provides music and video metadata and technologies to entertainment products and brands in the United States and internationally. Gracenote provides music recognition technologies that compare digital music files to a worldwide database of music information, enabling digital audio devices to identify the songs. The company licenses its technologies to developers of consumer electronics devices and online media players, who integrate the technologies into media players, home and car stereos, and digital music devices. The company operates five business verticals: Music, Video, Sports, Automotive and Video Personalization. Headquartered in Emeryville, California, the company employs approximately 1,700 people in 20 offices around the world. Gracenote is a division of Tribune Media Company which owns and operates a sizable portfolio of television and digital properties which bring entertainment, news and sports content to local and national audiences. Gracenote is best known for MusicID, a music recognition solution that identifies compact discs and delivers artist metadata and cover art to the desktop. Gracenote database includes music genre and mood information, TV show descriptions, episode information and channel line-ups, movie cast and crew information and sports statistics and results. Companies including music services, TV providers, consumer electronics manufacturers and automakers use Gracenote data to power their content recognition, universal search, navigation, linking, discovery and personalized recommendations functionality. Formerly CDDB (Compact Disc Data Base), Gracenote maintains and licenses an Internet-accessible database containing information about the contents of audio compact discs and vinyl records. It provides software and metadata to businesses that enable their customers to manage and search digital media. Gracenote provides its media management technology and global media database of digital entertainment information to the mobile, automobile, portable, home, and PC markets. Several computer software applications that were capable of playing CDs, for example Media Go and iTunes, used Gracenote's CDDB technology. Winamp, once a major licensee, no longer has access to Gracenote; the legacy media player program lost access to Gracenote when SHOUTcast and Winamp were sold by AOL in 2014. Redevelopment of Winamp continues by its new owner Radionomy who have said that future Winamp versions will have access to an online music database. In 2014 Tribune Media Company bought Gracenote from Sony Corporation of America."

  "text" : "Gabriel Resources Ltd. is a Canadian TSX-listed resource company focused on permitting and developing controversial Roșia Montană gold and silver project located in western central Romania. The Project, the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Europe, is owned through Rosia Montana Gold Corporation S.A. (RMGC), a Romanian Company in which Gabriel Resources holds an 80.69% stake and CNCAF Minvest S.A., a Romanian state-owned mining enterprise, the rest.. Rosia Montana is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Europe, hosting measured and indicated resources of 10 million ounces of gold and 47.6 million ounces of silver, together with an inferred resource of 1.2 million ounces of gold. The project is estimated to produce 626,000 ounces of gold annually during its first five years of operation, with an estimated average of 500,000 ounces of gold and 1.79 million ounces of silver per year over its 16-year mine life. The project is in an area which has been mined for many centuries and as recently as 2006 was subject to open pit mining by Minvest. The project is subject to many protests. In September 2013, street protests took place in Bucharest, Cluj and other Romanian cities (see 2013 Romanian protests against the Roșia Montană Project). As a result, Gabriel shares dropped 64 percent (to a total of 41 percent drop this year), its rating being suspended by Scotia Capital."

The name \"Gardner Rich\" was chosen for the company by Gardner because he considers Marc Rich, the commodities trader pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001, \"one of the most successful futures traders in the world\". Gardner had originally attended an unpaid internship program at Dean Witter Reynolds in 1981 (during which test he was homeless). He won a position as a stockbroker at Dean Witter and two years later he left for Bear Stearns where he became a top earner. In 1987 he founded Gardner Rich, with only $10,000 and one piece of furniture. The 2006 movie, The Pursuit of Happyness, is based upon Chris Gardner's life story, struggles and successes."

Until the 1980s, Graham's primary product was half-inch, open-reel magnetic tape. Graham was the last manufacturer of open-reel 9 track tape, but ceased production at the end of 2001. Currently, as of 2007, Graham Magnetics buys used tape cartridges and reconditions them for reuse. For the period 1995–1999, Graham was a part of Anacomp Corp. During this time, Anacomp/Graham was the world leader in open-reel computer tape production and one of 3 major manufacturers of IBM 3480 Family tape cartridges. They sold tape under the Graham, Memorex, and other brands. In 1999, Anacomp spun off the magnetic tape line of business as eMag Solutions. This included the Graham magnetics division. After ending 9-track magnetic tape production, Graham entered the business of recertifying tape cartridges. In 2006, the company developed a process for eradicating data from tape cartridges while preserving the servo tracks. In 2007, eMag sold Graham to RBE Enterprises of Dallas, TX."

Global Mission was voted at the 1990 General Conference Session as a special initiative to reach people in the so-called 10/40 Window with the gospel. Typically Global Mission pioneers work within their culture and language group. Unlike typical missionaries they already know the culture, and are thus more easily accepted by the community."

In the wake of Portugal's defeat and unconditional surrender to India following the invasion of Goa by the Indian Armed Forces in 1961, it was requisitioned to manufacture warships for the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard. GSL is undergoing a modernization of its yard to adapt to the latest technology in shipbuilding. To this purpose it is negotiating with well-known shipbuilders for an arrangement to collaborate. To date it has built 167 vessels, including barges, tugs, landing craft, offshore patrol vessels and other vessels for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard and for export to countries like Yemen. A new slipway has been commissioned to take up major repair jobs of ships in the dry dock area. A damage control simulator and two double boom level luffing cranes for heavy lifting have been constructed."

Global Marine, the legacy of Cable & Wireless Marine and British Telecom Marine, was purchased by Global Crossing in 1999, at which time it received the name it carries today. In 2004 Global Marine Systems was purchased by Bridgehouse Marine and was completely restructured. In September 2014 Global Marine was acquired by HC2. Historically, the company has a legacy of over 160 years of cable installation, stemming from the first telegraph cables laid in the 1850s. Global Marine has a worldwide presence, with offices in Chelmsford, UK and Singapore; Depots in Portland, UK; Bermuda; Vancouver, Canada; Batangas, Philippines and Batam, Indonesia; Ships stationed around the world to support both installation of new cables and maintenance/protection of existing cables; and joint ventures with China Telecom and Huawei. Since 2002 Global Marine has become increasingly active in the installation of submarine power cables and gained significant market share in the European Offshore Renewables market, in addition to undertaking a number of large power interconnect projects. The company was responsible for installing the cables connecting the turbines on a host of windfarm projects including Blythe (one of the first trial farms), Horns Rev 1 (the first major commercial windfarm in Denmark), Thornton Bank, Kentish Flats and others. To support this business Global Marine formed a subsidiary in 2011 called Global Marine Energy. The development of the energy business included the opening of a new office in Middlesbrough and the construction of a specialist vessel, Cable Enterprise. The subsidiary company was sold to Prysmian Group, the world’s largest cable manufacturer at the time of sale, in September 2012. Global Marine today focuses primarily on supporting the telecoms, oil & gas and deep sea research markets with an extraordinary history in delivering subsea projects Global Marine is in a prime position to offer a wide variety of innovative cabling systems meeting the subsea engineering requirements of companies around the globe. In 2014 Global Marine received recognition firstly when presented the Order of Distinction by RoSPA recognising the 15th consecutive year of outstanding occupational health and safety records and then later in the year receiving the Engineering Award at the prestigious International Business Awards in Singapore."

By combining research into a single tree that users work on together, users can focus on verifying information and on new avenues of research, rather than spending time duplicating research that others have already done. Over 98.6 million profiles were created on Geni by over 5.8 million users as of December 2010. Geni was the original parent company of enterprise messaging service Yammer, which became part of Microsoft on July 19, 2012. In November 2012, Geni was acquired by MyHeritage."

GPC also provides IP advisory services including strategy, management, patent portfolio mining, patent triage, technology transfer, and other IP-related services. According to Steven M. Cherry from the IEEE Spectrum, GPC is perhaps one of the oldest and most successful patent enforcement companies. The company remains privately held since 1987 when it was founded by Alexander Poltorak to assist inventors and IP owners in licensing and enforcing their IP rights. The company was incorporated in 1989. Since 1996, GPCI (now GPC) has been actively licensing and enforcing a portfolio of “smart connector” patents. In 1997, GPCI filed two patent infringement suits against IBM and U.S. Robotics in the Southern District of New York and Against Hayes and seven modem manufacturers in the Central District of California. In 1998 GPCI sued Motorola. All defendants settled by taking a license under the patents. In 2000, GPCI spun off the “smart connector” business into a wholly owned subsidiary, Acticon Technologies LLC. To date, after winning patent reexamination proceeding at the USPTO and successfully litigating 26 patent infringement lawsuits, GPCI licensed the Acticon \"smart connector\" patents to more than 150 companies. GPCI successfully represented Moen Technologies LLC in its litigation against The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo; Forward Technologies LLC vs. SBC Communications; Scieran Technologies, Inc. vs. Bausch & Lomb; Trounson Automation LLC vs. Yaskawa et al., Leighton Technologies LLC vs. Oberthur, and many other patent infringement cases. The idea incubator was spun off in 2000 as IP Holdings LLC, which later became the financial arm of GPC. In the 2007-2009 period, AT&T, Sony Ericsson, Nokia, LG, Motorola, T-Mobile, and Samsung all settled patent infringement lawsuits and agreed to license a key cellphone patent from Digital Technology Licensing LLC a subsidiary of GPC."

  "text" : "GeoEye Inc. (formerly Orbital Imaging Corporation or ORBIMAGE) was an American commercial satellite imagery company based in Herndon, Virginia. GeoEye was merged into the DigitalGlobe corporation January 29th, 2013. The company was founded in 1992 as a division of Orbital Sciences Corporation in the wake of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business. The division was spun off in 1997. It changed its name to GeoEye in 2006 after acquiring Denver, Colorado-based Space Imaging for $58 million. Space Imaging was founded and controlled by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Its principal asset was the IKONOS satellite. Although ORBIMAGE's first chairman was Orbital chairman David W. Thompson, and Orbital at the time owned more than 60 percent of the stock, it no longer has a substantial interest in the company or its successor. GeoEye provided 253,000,000 square kilometres (98,000,000 sq mi) of satellite map images to Microsoft and Yahoo! search engines. In 2008 Google secured exclusive online mapping use of the GeoEye-1 satellite. GeoEye maintained major contracts with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for the provision of reconnaissance and imagery data. In the early twenty-first century GeoEye was headquartered in Herndon, Virginia. Satellite Operations were conducted from Herndon, Virginia and Thornton, Colorado. The location in Saint Louis, Missouri provided additional image processing. Multiple ground stations were located worldwide. In 2011, GeoEye was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites. GeoEye was purchased by DigitalGlobe in 2013."

  "text" : "GVFX, initially Gajdecki Visual Effects, was a Visual effects company initially based in Toronto, founded in the spring of 1991 by John Gajdecki. A second branch of the company based in Vancouver was started in 1998. There was also a Los Angeles branch, which was closed in the summer of 2003. The Toronto office closed in September 2003, with the company being consolidated to its Vancouver branch. The company was in financial trouble at that point, with employees being owed back wages, and Gajdecki stating that \"this company didn't have enough money to cover its expenses\". Carrying the high capital costs of visual effects equipment proved too much, and he has since liquidated much of his corporate and personal assets to cover the outstanding bills. The Vancouver branch was restructured in 2004. In 2006 Gajdecki worked with Director James Gunn (Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed and Dawn of the Dead) on the feature film Slither “We created 261 shots of which I think about 10 were easy…” Gajdecki says. “The rest was CG creature extensions, CG parasites all over the place, the usual number of wire removals, a flashback on an alien world, stunt enhancements, matte paintings and even an asteroid colliding with the earth! Nine different vendors produced about half of the shots; the rest was created by an in-house unit that I set up.” In 2008 and 2009 Gajdecki worked with Director Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling) and LA VFX Supervisor Robert Skotak (Titanic and Aliens)on 3D Stereoscopic feature film The Hole, Gajdecki was says \"We're working on The Hole, a psychological suspense feature that is shooting in Stereo in Vancouver and LA. The VFX are being completed both in Vancouver and in LA; I'm heading up the Vancouver half and Robert Skotak (Titanic and Aliens) heading up the LA half. We are moving away from our long-standing relationship with Digital Fusion and moving to NUKE for 2D and sticking with Maya for 3D. Also, we are the first to use the REVIEW features of Frame Cycler in Stereo Mode and are Alpha testing a new stereo projection system that is very slick indeed. The economic recession is not felt as heavily in Canada as in other countries due in large part to sound government policies, and as always we are as busy as we need to be.\" In 2009 and 2010 Gajdecki worked with Director Alex Zamm on Disney's Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. The film shot in Los Angeles and Gajdecki worked in China with Hong Kong company Centro VFX and Beiing VFX company Base FX."

  "text" : "GRE (株式会社　ゼネラル　リサ－チ　オブ　エレクトロニックス General Research of Electronics, Inc.) was a Japan-based multinational manufacturer of electronics equipment, primarily in the fields of radio and other telecommunications. Their products included transceivers, radio scanners, antennas, GPS devices, and satellite equipment. They also produced OEM equipment for other companies, including Radio Shack, Uniden and Commtel. GRE was established in 1961, and its headquarters was located in Tokyo. GRE had a manufacturing facility in Chiba Prefecture which closed in October 2012. In late 1977, GRE established \"GRE America, Inc.\", its first overseas operation, with a head office in California. The company established its second overseas corporation, \"GRE (Hong Kong), Ltd.\", in 1986. In October, 2012, their China factory was shuttered and they ceased all production. While there have been some reports that GRE intends to resume business, without hardware engineers, software engineers, or major customers, it is unlikely that they will ever be able to resume production. GRE America continues to service GRECOM products and to sell and service Alinco radio products for the North American market. In May, 2013, GRE America Inc (USA Branch) moved from its Belmont, CA location after losing Alinco’s Distribution rights in North American market. GRE America relocated in the City of San Leandro, CA. In January, 2014, Whistler Group took over production of GRE's scanner line. Due to several of GRE's engineers working with Whistler, the products produced by the overtaking company are very similar to that of GRE's at the time of operation cessation. Whistler later began selling radio scanners formerly produced for Radio Shack with separate product numbers but identical hardware. In February, 2014, GRE (Japan) head office closed its Tokyo office and relocated to its Chiba location where they had once produced its product line when it first established back in 1961. In September 2014 'General Research of Electronics' Japan (GRE) decided cease its USA business operations and closed its California office since there is no active business due to lack of financial resource and development capabilities at GRE Japan.

  "text" : "Game Republic Inc. (株式会社ゲームリパブリック Kabushiki-gaisha Gēmu-Ripaburikku) was an independent video game developer based in Tokyo, Japan. The company, which employed just under 300 individuals before its closure, was founded on July 1, 2003 by Yoshiki Okamoto after he departed from Japanese game developer and publisher Capcom. He began working at rival game developer and publisher Konami in the 1980s, and was responsible for such arcade games as Gyruss and Time Pilot. He then moved to Capcom, where he worked on many franchises, such as 1942, Resident Evil and especially Street Fighter II. While Game Republic was a completely independent developer able to produce titles for any publisher and/or platform they desire, during the company's early years it had enjoyed a close relationship with Sony, with many of their early titles funded by and produced in conjunction with the publisher. In June 2011 reports surfaced of Game Republic shutting down its website and vacating its offices. Many of the former Game Republic developers have been hired by Tango Gameworks."

The company is best known for their high end bookcases, Desks, and other office furniture. Globe Wernicke established factories in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France and Germany. The company patented the 'elastic bookcases' also known as a modular bookcase. These were a high quality stacking book shelves, with a standard width of 34 inches, in Oak, Walnut and Mahogany, capable of being adapted to fit together to form a bookcase which could either be all of the same measurements or which could be re-arranged by the insertion of units of different depths and heights. These glass fronted shelves now are proving to be collectable, desirable and usable antiques - with regularity these bookcases appear in auctions and internet sites and, what originally cost $75 or so will now be sold for $900 or more. During World War II 90% of the company's business in the US was converted to produce military equipment."

Shortly after starting, one of Long’s friends, artist Tim Biskup joined them, and printed shirts with Biskup’s Gama-Goon character. The three of them together took the basement hobby and turned it into a company. In 2006, Tim Biskup ceased his creative involvement with the company. In 2006, GAMAGO shifted their focus from apparel to gifts for the home and kitchen. 2009 saw the release of The Flipper, a guitar shaped spatula. The success of The Flipper helped to cement GAMAGO's name among the top gift-ware design companies. GAMAGO products are available in 1000+ stores internationally. Products are also available online through the company's website and in their flagship store in San Francisco's SOMA neighborhood."

  "text" : "The Genealogical Society of Utah (GSU), established in 1894, does business as FamilySearch International, which is the genealogical arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (LDS Church), FamilySearch is the consumer brand for a variety of products and services, including the FamilySearch.org website, the world-famous Family History Library in Salt Lake City, and 4,600 local family history centers on the world. All of these resources were created to help people find their ancestors and are available free of charge to the public. Members of the LDS Church believe that tracing family lineage is essential for special religious ceremonies that seal family units together for eternity. According to Mormons, this fulfills a Biblical prophecy stating that the prophet Elijah would return to \"turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers.\""

Gandhi, born Yogesh Kathari, who claims to be related to Mahatma Gandhi. However, an immediate descendant of Mahatma Gandhi, publicly stated that Yogesh K. Gandhi was a \"scam artist\", and \"interested primarily in enriching himself.\" Yogesh Gandhi described the organization as dedicated to \"social betterment through nonviolence.\" The organization gave out the \"Mahatma Gandhi Humanitarian Award\". The organization's business dealings were investigated by the United States Senate, in March 1998. Mother Jones referred to the organization as: \"a shadowy non-profit enterprise devoted in principle to 'promoting the philosophy of non-violence'.\" On March 8, 1999, Yogesh Gandhi was charged by the United States Department of Justice with \"tax evasion, mail and wire fraud and perjury\" for dealings related to the Gandhi Memorial International Foundation. He had previously been indicted by the Justice Department's Campaign Financing Task Force in August 1998. In 1999, Yogesh Gandhi entered a guilty plea to the charges of mail fraud, tax evasion and violating federal election law over his contributions involving the Gandhi Memorial International Foundation and the Democratic National Committee in 1996. The Foundation was reported to have ceased its activities in 1999."

  "text" : "Genista Corporation uses computational models of human visual and auditory systems to measure what viewers see and hear. Resulting perceptual metrics complement existing technologies by predicting experienced quality measured by a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) formerly assessed using subjective tests from actual viewers. Digital video systems exploit properties of the human visual system to reduce the bit rate at which a video sequence is coded. Video quality assessment tools based on network quality metrics such as packet loss, MDI and PSNR do not correlate well with a perceived visual quality due to the nonlinear behavior of the human visual system. As a result, accurate prediction of the perceived quality of the output video should also take the human visual system properties into account. Genista Corporation’s patented technology is the result of research done by Stefan Winkler in the field of vision models and metrics. Details on his findings can be found in his book: Digital Video Quality, Stefan Winkler, Wiley, March 2005, ISBN 0-470-02404-6. In June 2007, Genista became part of Symmetricom’s QoE Assurance Division."

Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing in 2011, using the game mechanics in Radical Fishing by Vlambeer, before even giving the original creators a chance to publish their game first. Apart from the loss of income, this severely depressed the original creators who couldn't take legal action against Gamenauts because of loose copyright laws. In 2013 Vlambeer finally published Ridiculous Fishing, with the highest rated reviews of all year. In 2012, the company announced a publishing initiative for indie Asian developers, signing up studios from South East Asia such as Kurechii Studio, Menara Games, Artlogic Games and Nerdook Productions to publish their mobile titles for the worldwide market."

  "text" : "Greenfield Advisors LLC is a real estate and business consulting firm headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Originally known as Mundy Associates, it was founded in 1976 by Bill Mundy, the land economist for Weyerhaeuser Corporation. In the 1980s, Mundy and his firm became internationally recognized in the real estate appraisal profession as the leading authorities on the analysis and valuation of property impacted by environmental factors. The firm was engaged by attorneys representing many of the landholders in Alaska to evaluate the impacts of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and its research resulted in development of many of the more advanced methods widely used in the appraisal profession today. In 2007, the Appraisal Institute designated Mundy's 1992 article on \"Valuation of Contaminated Property\" one of the nine \"Big Ideas\" in the history of the valuation profession. In 2001, John A. Kilpatrick took the helm of Mundy Associates, and in 2005 the firm was re-branded Greenfield Advisors to accommodate its substantial growth into other areas of real estate advisory services. In recent years, the firm has become widely recognized as authorities on brownfield valuation, complex litigation support, contaminated property, complex real estate investments, and appraisal standards. In recent years, Greenfield has become recognized as leading experts in the Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) litigation."

  "text" : "General Motors do Brasil is the largest subsidiary of the General Motors in South America and the second largest operation outside the United States. In 2005 it completed 80 years of operation in Brazil. The company was founded in 1925 and operated in rented houses, located in the historic district of Ipiranga in São Paulo. In the early days the company only assembled cars using parts imported from the United States. After five years, GMB officially opened in 1930 with its first factory in São Caetano do Sul – São Paulo. In 1958 a second factory was opened Sao Jose dos Campos – São Paulo, officially inaugurated a year later by the President Juscelino Kubitschek. Decided to expand its product line, GMB launched in 1968 the first car of its Chevrolet brand in the country, the Opala, which closed its life cycle after 24 years, with more than 1 million units sold. Since then, it has stopped more than make successes of sales. In 1973 launched the Chevette, which has accumulated sales exceeding 1.2 million units, to be replaced by the Corsa in 1994, the first vehicle popular with electronic fuel injection. In July 2000 launched the Industrial Complex of Gravataí in Rio Grande do Sul, one of the world's most modern factories, where the line is produced and Celta, which receives visits from experts in manufacturing of vehicles from around the world who want to know the system's assembly model, which is done in partnership with suppliers of systems, installed within the industrial complex. The Celta was also the pioneer in the Brazilian market in the area of electronic commerce, becoming the best-selling model in the world via the Internet. Currently, the GMB sells the entire line Sonic, Spin and Montana to truck in this way. In 2005, GM of Brazil in the Brazilian market sold a total of 365,259 vehicles, with a participation of 21.3% in Brazilian market. In specific segments in which it produces vehicles, SUV's, utilities and commercial light, their participation was a little higher, from 22.6%. The company's total production reached 559,345 units, considering the vehicles ready for the domestic market and exports and also the vehicles \"CKD\" (completely knocked down). Exports of GM of Brazil in 2005 represented new record, reaching a value of US$ 1.6 billion, for the shipment of 114,994 units in \"CKD\" and 125,678 vehicles ready for some 40 countries around the world. The main market in the area of exports was Mexico, followed by Argentina, Venezuela, South Africa and other Latin American countries. Most gasoline powered vehicles in the Brazilian Chevrolet are flexfuel, capable of operating on 100% gasoline, 100% ethanol or any blend of the two. In the social area, the GM of Brazil focused activities through the General Motors Institute, which was created in 1993. Its mission is to rescue the citizenship of children, youths and adults from poor communities, which are located especially close to industrial plants of the company. Its shares are primarily in education. \"General Motors\" is a Market Leader in the \"Telematic\" field. In Brazil during 2015 the company had become the biggest Auto seller to the Retail segment."

The group is present in almost all the continents as North America, South America, Asia and Europe. The headquarters are in Madrid and the chairman is Àngel Simon i Grimaldos. Agbar is constituted by more than 230 companies and with more than 140 years of history. Agbar is specialized in the services of health, certification, construction and communications networks. A joint acquisition bid by Suez (now Suez Environnement) and Criteria CaixaCorp, concluded in January 2008, resulted in the two companies controlling around 90% of Agbar's shares. Suez and Criteria have stated that they do not intend to delist Agbar from the Madrid Stock Exchange, instead gradually increasing the free float percentage of the company's shares from ten to thirty percent with two years."

  "text" : "Great Lakes Brewing Company is a brewery and brewpub in Cleveland, Ohio. The first brewpub and microbrewery in the state, Great Lakes Brewing has been named important both to Cleveland's local identity, as well one of the initial forces behind the revival of the Ohio City neighborhood on the near West Side. In 2015, it was the 21st-largest craft brewery by volume and the 28th-largest overall brewery in the United States. The company was established in 1988 by brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway, both St. Edward High School graduates, in Cleveland's Ohio City neighborhood, located near St. Ignatius High School and the West Side Market. The brewpub and restaurant remain in their original locations, while production has expanded to adjacent properties. The present site allows visitors to enjoy a glass of beer in the original brewpub which features a Tiger Mahogany bar from the 1860s, a Beer Cellar and the Rockefeller Room, named after Standard Oil founder and Clevelander, John D. Rockefeller who was thought to have worked in the building. There is a gift shop selling beer, along with apparel and barware. Tours are available on the weekends. Since its inception, Great Lakes has also served as an incubator for Northeast Ohio brewers, with brewmasters at nearby Market Garden and Goldhorn Brewery in the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood both being alumni of Great Lakes."

  "text" : "GuiXT is a client–server system developed by Synactive, Inc. It provides user-interface customization to SAP. It was created specifically for use with SAP and is integrated with SAP, but GuiXT Solutions operate independently of SAP solutions. That enables firms to tailor “do-everything” SAP transaction screens to the narrower requirements of specific jobs within their organizations while leaving essential SAP coding untouched. The “hands-off” design simplifies development and testing significantly. GuiXT Solutions users report greatly improved productivity and accuracy while, at the same time, reducing training and support costs. GuiXT Solutions are offered by Synactive, Inc., a US firm headquartered in Foster City, California. Synactive was founded in 1998 by Dr. Gerhard Rode and Thomas Ewe. Their first product was GuiXT, designed to operate in conjunction with SAP’s graphical user interface, SAPgui. At this time, Synactive offers GuiXT Solutions supporting a number of workstation alternatives. GuiXT Fuzion delivers standard or enhanced SAP transaction screens in web browser environments with a minimum of development time. It is fully certified for use with SAP NetWeaver, and delivers SAP transaction screens with or without SAP Portals. GuiXT Mobile provides “instant-on” SAP operation and reliable offline protection to mobile PCs including handheld and RF devices. GuiXT Offline delivers secure SAP transactions to PC compatible devices in remote locations. All of the GuiXT Solutions share a common technology, so solutions are easy to port from one delivery channel to others. Being an SAP Partner these solutions are already built into SAP and no changes are necessary when upgrading SAP versions. Applications of GuiXT Solutions include simplifying material creation to one click, combining notifications and work order into a single transaction, Wi-Fi enables a plant so that plant workers can get access to SAP anywhere, minimizing or eliminating user training on SAP."

GAC is currently known for its Honda-branded auto producing joint venture with this Japanese automaker, but the company has a total of five foreign partners—more than most Chinese automakers. These partnerships allow it to produce foreign-branded products for sale in China. These brands include: Fiat, Honda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. Other brand names associated with GAC are Everus, for consumer vehicles, and Hino."

After many wins in motorcycle trials competitions and developing a successful US export market, the original company ceased trading following a fire in 1977. Richard Deal bought the rights to the Greeves name in May 1999. The new business continues to develop motorcycles and launched the first new Greeves trials bike for 20 years in January 2009, with an all-new British two-stroke 280 cc engine."

  "text" : "Geometric Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Geometric Limited, and known until October 2007 as TekSoft, Inc. supplies CAMWorks, a Computer Aided Manufacturing(CAM Software) product. Currently it sources its High Speed Machining strategies from an unnamed third party that \"devotes 10–15 programmers to developing just this module\". The company's first product was ProCAD/CAM (introduced in 1984), which was largely discontinued by 2006 due to the difficulty in managing 20-plus year-old DOS-based code. CAMWorks is a fully integrated computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) solution designed to operate within SolidWorks. It uses its knowledge base (called TechDBTM) and Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) tools to help in the machining processes. Automatic Feature Recognition – An interesting feature in CAMWorks is the AFR technology which analysis the solid model geometry and identifies mill features such as holes, slots, pockets and bosses; turning features such as outside and inside profiles, faces, grooves and cutoffs, and wire EDM features such as die openings. This recognition feature helps in reducing the time spent by the designer to feed in data related to his machining. The features that cannot be found automatically or that need to be defined for your specific machining requirements can be defined effortlessly using the Interactive Feature Recognition (IFR) wizard. Knowledge base - is a self populating data base which contains all the information about the cutting tools and the parameters used by the operator. It also maintains information regarding the cutting tools available in the shop floor. This data base within CAMWorks can be customized easily to suit the user and the shop floor’s requirements. The database can be utilized for all the manufacturing processes viz. milling, turning, mill turn and wire EDM. This data base helps in storing the best practices at a centralized location in the tool room. Thus, eliminates the non uniformity in the NC codes between two users. The machining modules included in CAMWorks are: ▪ 2½ Axis Mill - includes automatic roughing, finishing, thread milling, face milling and single point (drilling, boring, reaming, tapping) cycles to machine prismatic features ▪ 3 Axis Mill - includes 2.5 axis capabilities plus routines to machine complex, contoured surfaces routinely encountered in mold making and aerospace applications. ▪ 2 and 4 Axis Turning - includes automatic roughing, finishing, grooving, threading, cutoff and single point (drilling, boring, reaming and tapping) cycles ▪ Mill-Turn with 5 axis Simultaneous machining support - includes milling and turning capabilities for multitasking machine centers. Supports C, Y and B axis machining at compound angles and 5 axis simultaneous machining.▪ Multiaxis Machining - 4 axis and 5 axis machining - includes high-performance automotive port finishing, impellers, turbine blades, cutting tools, 5 Axis trimming, and undercut machining in mold and die making▪ Wire EDM - 2.5 Axis and 4 Axis cutting operations automate the creation of rough, skim and tab cuts CAMWorks is being used by manufacturers across aerospace, automotive, electronics and medical industries. CAMWorksXpress, (the lighter version of CAMWorks) is an easy to use 2.5D CAM package that runs seamlessly inside SolidWorks®, and provides the high powered features required for machining parts efficiently."

  "text" : "G-Star RAW (commonly called G-Star) is a Dutch designer clothing company that, founded by Jos van Tilburg in Amsterdam in 1989, produces urban clothing. Models for the brand include Liv Tyler, Lily Cole, Girls' Generation, World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen, Clémence Poésy and musician Sergio Pizzorno. It was showcased at the New York Fashion Week from 2008 to 2011. G-Star was originally named Gap Star but decided to change their name upon going international to avoid confusion with the already established Gap. The brand specializes in making raw denim—an unwashed, untreated denim. G-Star is influenced by military clothing. Inspirations of their designs come from vintage military apparel from around the world. Some examples include special pockets constructions and the use of trims. G-Star's flagship stores are located in New York City, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Sydney, Shanghai, Paris, London, Cardiff, Milan, Santiago de Chile, Mumbai and the Netherlands as its home base in the most luxurious shopping street of Amsterdam, the P.C. Hooftstraat. In total, G-Star has more than 6500 selling points worldwide."

The Trust advises conservationists, farmers and land managers on ways to improve wildlife habitat and enhance the countryside for public benefit. It also lobbies government for agricultural and conservation policies based on science. Notable conservation projects of the Trust are those conserving grey partridges, black grouse and regarding control of mink where they are preying on water voles."

  "text" : "Gilly Hicks was a lingerie brand owned by Abercrombie & Fitch, specializing in women's underwear and loungewear. It competed primarily with Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret PINK, and Aerie (an intimates spinoff of American Eagle Outfitters). Designed to mimic a colonial-style manor house, the store featured arched hallways, mirrored walls, potted plants, and crystal chandeliers reminiscent of its sister brands Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister Co. Its first store opened at Natick Mall in Natick, Massachusetts on January 21, 2008. On November 6, 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch announced it would close Gilly Hicks' retail stores, but continue the brand's online operations. The brand was folded into sister company Hollister Co. in 2015. Gilly Hicks lingerie and sleep products are still sold at Hollister stores and online as of 2016."

  "text" : "GrainCorp Limited is a public company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in Australia. The company's core business is the receival and storage of grain and related commodities. It also provides logistics and markets these commodities. As of 2015, the company's chief executive is Mark Palmquist and its chairman, Don Taylor. The company was founded as a New South Wales public sector agency, Government Grain Elevator (later the Grain Elevators Board), in 1917. It was formed to transport grain from local collection points located on railways throughout the grain-producing regions of New South Wales. It was later known as the Grain Handling Authority. It was privatised in 1992 with a majority of shares being transferred to grain growers, and listed on ASX in 1998. GrainCorp's operations have subsequently extended into other Australian states by amalgamations with other grain handling operations. The company operates an extensive network of rail-linked storages across south-east Australia, as well as seven strategically located export terminals in Brisbane, Gladstone, Mackay, Newcastle, Port Kembla, Geelong and Portland, Victoria. In November 2009 Graincorp expanded into North America through the purchase of the United Malt Holdings group of companies. In July 2011, Graincorp agreed to buy maltster GermanMalt GmbH & Co for $77 million, extending its reach into Europe. As of 2012, the company was receiving acquisition bids from Archer Daniels Midland. In April 2013, the Archer Daniels Midland bid was considered by the GrainCorp Board. The bid was disallowed by Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey on the 29th of November, 2013, citing that it \"would not be in our national interest\". Graincorp operates a fleet of 18 48 Class locomotives in Eastern Australia."

  "text" : "(For the American arts organization, see Golden Fleece Ltd.) Golden Fleece was a brand of petroleum products and service stations operated by H.C. Sleigh and Company. A partnership was founded in Melbourne, Australia in 1893 by shipowner and merchant Harold Crofton Sleigh (1867–1933) and manufacturer and shipowner John McIlwraith (1828–1902). In 1913 the company took delivery of its first consignment of motor spirit from the United States and marketed it in Australia as \"Golden Fleece\". Initially, motor spirit was sold in drums only—the first Golden Fleece pump being installed in 1920. Golden Fleece was a pioneer of single-branded service stations (as opposed to the more common multi-brand offerings of the era), and its distinctive \"golden merino\" trademark was soon a common sight for Australian motorists. The post-war era saw a massive expansion of Australia's motor industry and car ownership soared. The company was made public in 1947. These were boom times for Golden Fleece and expansion and acquisitions were the trend throughout the 1950s and 1960s. H.C. Sleigh Limited acquired the fledgling \"Kangaroo\" and \"Phillips 66\" brands in 1962 and 1967 respectively. During these years, many (if not most) Golden Fleece service stations became roadhouse-style outlets with restaurants and bold signage. Some time during the 60-70's Golden Fleece gained a major contract by the, then small, major trucking company Linfox, that is still held by Caltex today, due to a friendship between Regional Manager for Victoria Max Collins and Lindsay Fox. The company never had its own oil refinery and depended on Caltex to facilitate the importation and refining of crude oils at Kurnell in Sydney on its behalf. In the late 1970s the industry started to mature and rationalise due to soaring crude oil prices, and Federal Government oversight of petrol and diesel prices which was a subtle form of price control. Inevitably Golden Fleece was itself acquired by Caltex in 1981 and no longer trades under that name, though its unique livery can still be seen on some older roadhouses in rural Australia. A particular treasure for collectors are the globes (in the shape of the Golden Fleece ram) that sat atop the company's pumps until the 1970s, when the pumps were standardised. Purr Pull was a brand marketed by Independent Oil Industries of Sydney they also sold Purr Star and Resis Oil. The company was brought out by Smith Wylie (Aust) Pty Ltd in Queensland who ran the company as Purr Pull Industries and then in 1954 H.C. Sleigh took over Purr Pull Industries Pty Ltd. dropping the Purr Pull and Star brands and selling it as Golden Fleece."

  "text" : "The Green House Project is an American national non-profit organization dedicated to creating alternative living environments to traditional nursing home care facilities. The project creates “caring homes for meaningful lives” for elders where residents have private rooms and baths, can move freely through the home, build deep knowing relationships with each other more and even participate in preparing their own meals. It is based on a philosophy seeking to reverse the “enforced dependency” of life in a traditional nursing home by creating small intentional communities of 7-10 elders designed to foster late-life development and growth. Residents of Green House Project homes have shown “increased reports of mobility and social interaction, and fewer reports of weight loss and depression” compared with those living in traditional nursing home facilities."

  "text" : "GTE Interactive Media was founded as GTE ImagiTrek in 1990 by Richard E. Robinson, as a division of GTE Vantage, a wholly owned subsidiary of the now defunct telecommunications provider GTE. Located in Carlsbad, California, the unit's focus was on the development of videos, of interactive television platforms, and of interactive video game products for arcade machines, home console cartridges, and CD-ROMs, including development and publishing under the GTE Entertainment brand. Originally named GTE ImagiTrek, it was renamed GTE Interactive Media in 1994. In January 1995, the division entered a partnership with Nintendo for the development of arcade games and of online networking. In the same month, they previewed their first title, FX Fighter, at Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Experiencing difficulties in the video game market and a boom in the deregulated telecommunications market, the division steadily cut down a high of 120 employees in 1996. Failing to find a buyer or partner, it announced in January 1997 that it would cease operations on March 14, 1997. Citing hardships in the entire CD-ROM market, Dick Nordman, finance director for GTE's new ventures group in Irving, Texas, explained, \"In the beginning, the idea was that we wanted to get into the content business. Now, with everything else going on in the telecommunications industry, we felt our energies would be better spent in the telco arena.\""

Its operations consist of securing crude oil upstream and delivering it to market via pipelines and tankers. The company, which was founded in 2000, is the fourth largest crude oil trader in the world after Glencore, Vitol, and Trafigura. The company was co-founded and controlled by Gennady Timchenko together with Torbjörn Törnqvist (after whose mother the company is named); however, due to United States sanctions, Timchenko sold his stake in the company to Törnqvist in March 2014. Gunvor's largest single supplier of crude oil was once Russia, though the company now originates most of its crude oil from the Americas, with less than 13 percent coming from Russia. It also trades African, Asian, and South-American crude and is active on all continents. In 2011, Gunvor was trading less than 20% of Russia's seaborne oil."

Taking part in Greenwave is a practical way to support the teaching of Social Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) part of the Irish Primary School Curriculum. The students develop their skills in: \n* Observing \n* Classifying \n* Recognising patterns \n* Estimating and measuring \n* Recording and communicating Schools registered in the Discover Primary Science programme, another initiative of DSE, can also earn credit towards their Award of Science Excellence by taking part in Greenwave.

  "text" : "Grupo Globo (English: Globo Group) formerly known as Organizações Globo (English: Globo Organization)) is the largest mass media group of Latin America, founded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1925 by Irineu Marinho. It also formerly owned companies on the food industry and the real estate and financial markets. The first enterprise of the company was the newspaper A Noite. With the success of the newspaper, published on the late afternoon, Marinho decided to launch the morning daily O Globo in 1925. After his sudden death, just weeks after the launch of O Globo, his son, Roberto Pisani Marinho, became the director of the company. Working actively on the media business, Roberto Marinho decided to invest in other areas and launched Radio Globo on 1944. However, the company only became recognizable nationwide after the launching of Rede Globo, the second-largest commercial TV network in the world, in 1965. The company is currently run by the sons of Roberto Marinho: Roberto Irineu Marinho, João Roberto Marinho, and José Roberto Marinho. In May 2013, a study released by media agency ZenithOptimedia showed Globo occupied the 17th place in a list with the top global media owners. It was the first time the company appeared on this ranking. This ranking was still held in 2015."

  "text" : "Gallet is a historic Swiss manufacturer of high-end timepieces for professional, military, sports, racing, and aviation use. Gallet [pronunciation: gal-ey / ˈgæl.eɪ] is the world’s oldest watch and clock making house with history dating back to Humbertus Gallet, a clock maker who became a citizen of Geneva in 1466. The Gallet & Cie (Gallet & Company) name was officially registered by Julien Gallet (1806–1849) in 1826, who moved the family business from Geneva to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Prior to this date, operations commenced under the name of each of the Gallet family patriarchs. Gallet is best known during the 20th century to the present day for its line of MultiChron chronograph wristwatches. Produced primarily for military, industrial, and other professional applications, Gallet’s MultiChron watches often incorporated a number of advanced timekeeping innovations. A Gallet timepiece of particular renown was the Flight Officer time zone chronograph. Commissioned by Senator Harry S. Truman in 1939 for pilots of the United States Army Air Forces, the Flight Officer (a.k.a. Flying Officer) had a rotating 12-hour bezel and the names of 23 major world cities printed on the periphery of the dial (face). These features made it possible to calculate changes in the time as an aviator flew across lines of longitude. Besides being the first time zone calculating wristwatch, the Flight Officer was the first wristwatch with a rotating bezel and one of the world’s first wrist chronographs to be housed in a water resistant case. Truman wore a Gallet Flight Officer during his terms as 33rd president (1945–1953). The modern Gallet Company is one of a small handful of independent Swiss watch brands that still maintain in-house manufacturing facilities. While recently expanding the company’s marketing focus to reach a wider audience of “civilian” consumers for its expensive professional-use timepieces, Gallet continues to privately produce components and modules for a number of other entities within the luxury-class timekeeping industry."

  "text" : "General Motors South Africa, or GMSA, is a wholly owned subsidiary of American automobile manufacturer General Motors. It manufacturers and distributes automobiles under the Chevrolet, Opel and Isuzu brands. The company is headquartered in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Founded in 1913, GMSA initially distributed Chevrolet vehicles before beginning to manufacture and distribute vehicles of all of GM's brands in 1926, with the Chevrolet Series AA Capitol. By the 1960s this included the British Vauxhall marque. In 1986, it was sold off and rebranded the Delta Motor Corporation as a result of the passage of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in the United States and subsequent divestment of General Motors from apartheid South Africa. Delta continued to use the Opel, Isuzu and Suzuki brands under licence from GM as well as pay for the supply of assembly kits. Following the transition to democracy in the 1990s, GM acquired a 49 percent stake in the company in 1997, and in 2004 the company once again became a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, reverting to its original name. It also assembles vehicles for export to other right hand drive markets in the region, such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Kenya and Mauritius. Although GM divested the last of its ownership of Isuzu, it still owns the dealership network in South Africa, and builds/assembles the Isuzu pickups and trucks."

  "text" : "Gio-Goi /ˈɡiːoʊ ˈɡɔɪ/ is a British fashion brand created in the 1980s, and relaunched in 2005. The label has its roots in the Manchester band scene of the late 1980s, which mixed indie rock and dance music. The Donnellys started out selling clothes and memorabillia at clubs and raves in Manchester, notably at The Haçienda. After a legal battle with Giorgio Armani over the legality of using \"Gio\" in its branding, the Donnellys decided to end production. Gio-Goi relaunched in 2005 after new financial backers were keen to revive the brand. It is now worn by several musicians, including Pete Doherty, Hardwell, Mike Skinner and Kasabian front man, Tom Meighan. Actors Danny Dyer and Paul Nicholls as well as boxer Michael Jennings, and musicians Calvin Harris and Hard-Fi have also been seen wearing Gio-Goi clothing. Gio-Goi collaborated with Pete Doherty to create a range of T-shirts. The line was exclusively available from Selfridges in London on 7 December 2006 for 30 days and was released to selected stores thereafter. In December 2008, Pentland Group bought a 20% stake in Gio-Goi. Pentland's chief executive Andy Rubin said: \"This is a very positive investment in a growing brand which is win-win for both sides. This is a strategic investment for us. We think Gio-Goi has been doing a phenomenal job.\" In October 2010, Gio Goi opened their first ever high street store in Union Square Aberdeen. In January 2013, Gio Goi went under administration and was bought out by retailer JD Sports."

  "text" : "The Guru Gobind Singh Children's Foundation (GGSCF) was established by children and youth in 1999 as a way to celebrate the 300th Anniversary of the Khalsa and to honour the tenth Guru of the Sikhs. The origins of the youth group in Scarborough Gurdwara who took up the initiative to establish the foundation go back to 1993 when a 50 km charity relay run-a-thon was organized for the Hospital for Sick Children. Some of the younger children, as they grew up, then repeated the run in 1997 in support of the Canadian Cancer Society. The spirit from this run was then captured and energies were directed into the celebrations of the 300th anniversary of the Khalsa that was about two years away. At a special meeting held on May 18, 1998 some 50 children/youth and some parents helped to choose the name of the foundation and set a general direction. The feeling was that we need a foundation which could help those in need on an on-going basis rather than having one-off events, that would be recognized in the larger community, and where the children and youth could focus their energies and do sewa as a way of showing the world the spirit of our Gurus that is in each of us. On July 3 to 5, 1998 an Akhand Path was held to obtain the Guru's blessings for the effort. On January 23, 1999 the GGSCF held its first event to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Khalsa in the form of a dinner where plans for the 500 km charity relay run-a-thon from Toronto to Ottawa were presented. Then from July 11 to 17, 1999 children with the help of older youth and parents completed the relay run that started Dixie Gurdwara and finished on the steps of Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Over 300 children took part, of which 51 children and youth ran all seven days. On the journey and with every step of the 582 km route to Parliament Hill the children and youth showed the spirit of the Sikh Gurus and thereby established the GGSCF with the blessings of WaheGuru."

  "text" : "GeoVector Corporation (originally named Criticom Corporation) began conducting research into augmented reality in early 1990s. The company, co-founded by John Ellenby, who also founded laptop pioneer GRiD Systems Corporation, devised a method to use sensors in a device to associate relevant digital information with places on earth. The basic concept around which most of GeoVector's R&D has focused is that knowing the position and orientation of the device allows the application to provide digital information associated with a place in the real world. Position and direction data can be used to create a virtual vector which intersects with objects indexed in databases by their latitude and longitude coordinates. GeoVector's first patent in this domain, since issued as 5,815,411, was filed September 10, 1993.The company originally held the trademark for \"Augmented Reality\" (issued in 1995) but abandoned it as the term was generally adopted to describe this technique. Early GeoVector work focused on providing vertical solutions. One GeoVector augmented reality design used compass equipped binoculars along with GPS to superimpose nautical maps on the visual horizon thus improving the safety of navigation. A video showing early Augmented Reality concepts from GeoVector can be seen here GeoVector then discovered that their basic technology would improve the user experience on handheld devices delivering location aware applications. In this instance, actually viewing the real object was not necessary. Simply being able to refine the search for location information by knowing the direction of user interest or the specific object of his attention would be a significant benefit. The GeoVector team then implemented what they now refer to as the \"pointing\" feature. In 1998, \"Clipper\" project was initiated. The company built a prototype device known internally as The \"Little Guy\", a handheld \"pointable\" information appliance independent of a visual or video element.Since that time GeoVector has worked closely with sensor and device manufactures to encourage them to include GPS and compass elements in their products. In early 2006, there were sufficient pointing capable handsets in Japan for GeoVector to launch its first commercial product on the KDDI network with support of local partners NECM and Mapion. A video showing the functionality of Pointing is on YouTube. The company has continued its research and development in directional searching and augmented reality and has been awarded several patents in those areas. Further information about their intellectual property can be found on line at their website patent gallery."

In September 2006, Telecom Italia announces that, having received authorisation from the relevant Turkish authorities, the sale of 40.5% stake in Avea, held by subsidiary TIM International, to Turk Telekom, for a total of USD 500 million, has been finalised. Therefore, the current shareholder structure is 81% owned by Turk Telekom and remaining 19% by Is Bankasi. Its competitors, Turkcell and Vodafone Turkey, have both been founded in 1994 and use the GSM 900 frequency range while Avea uses the GSM 1800 range."

  "text" : "Great Southern Group was a group of Australian companies that was notable as the country's largest agribusiness managed investment scheme (MIS) business. The company was founded in 1987 and became a public company in 1999. It expanded its MIS business rapidly in the 2000s, supported by favourable tax regulations for these types of investments. Most of the Group's business was in plantation forestry to supply woodchips for the pulp and paper industry, but in the 2000s it diversified into high-value timbers, beef cattle, olives, viticulture, and almond production. The company's after-tax profit peaked at A$132 million in 2006, but by 2008 had deteriorated to a A$63 million loss. The Great Southern companies attracted debate and criticism associated with the operation of managed investment schemes generally, and the environmental performance of their Tiwi Islands operation in particular. On 16 May 2009, as a result of worsening economic conditions and regulatory issues, the GSL, GSMAL, GSF and other subsidiaries of GSL entered into voluntary administration. Ferrier Hodgson was assigned as liquidator of Great Southern Group. The collapse of Great Southern Group, in conjunction with the failure of another high-profile agribusiness company, Timbercorp, led to three separate Australian parliamentary committee inquiries into the MIS industry."

  "text" : "Good-Feel Co., Ltd. (株式会社グッド・フィール Kabushiki-Gaisha Guddo Fīru) is a Japanese video game developer. Good-Feel began in Hyogo, Japan in 2005 and soon opened a production facility in Tokyo. Their main focus has been educational games for the Nintendo DS, which have solely been released in Japan. The games, the first of which was released in 2007, consist of primers for very small children (kindergarten and below) and English language training for kids and adults. In 2008 the company transitioned into mainstream video games by becoming the developer for the Wii game Wario Land: Shake It! from the large publisher Nintendo. This marks Good-Feel's first entry into the home console market. The company was founded by former Konami employee Etsunobu Ebisu on March 10, 2005. He told Nintendo about the new company and asked if they could work on a game. Long-time Nintendo employee Takahiro Harada asked Ebisu if he would like to make a new Wario Land title, since Harada learned before the meeting that Ebisu was involved in the development of a Nintendo DS platform game he enjoyed very much, and Harada always wanted to make a Wario Land sequel. Though Ebisu suggested a shooting game, he agreed to create a platform game after Harada convinced him. The development resulted in Wario Land: Shake It!, a 2D platform game released in 2008 with hand-drawn graphics made with the help of the animation studios Production I.G and Kusanagi. They later made the 2010 game, Kirby's Epic Yarn, a unique entry into the Kirby franchise."

It replaced the previous E Toll system in Queensland. The new system was introduced on 1 July 2009 and the pay-on-the-spot option was phased out on 22 July 2009, meaning cash was no longer a payment option, and stopping was no longer required. As drivers are no longer able to pay with cash, they need to choose one of the new methods of paying Queensland's toll roads, including go viatags, go viavideo, go viabusiness (for ongoing toll payment), and go viavideo passes for one-off trips."

Evangelion has reportedly grossed over 150 billion yen, or approximately 1.2 billion USD. In a discussion at the 2006 Tekkoshocon, Matt Greenfield claimed Evangelion had grossed over 2 billion USD; Takeda 2002 reiterates that \"It sold record numbers of laserdiscs in Japan, and the DVD is still selling well today\", as well as for their association with award-winning anime director and studio co-founder Hideaki Anno. The company is headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo. Until Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gainax typically worked on stories created in-house, but the studio has increasingly developed anime adaptations of existing manga like Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou and Mahoromatic. Series produced by Gainax are often known for their controversial twist endings. The Animage Anime Grand Prix has been awarded to Gainax for Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water in 1991, Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995 and 1996, and The End of Evangelion in 1997."

On 30 June 2009, Global Gaming Factory X announced its intention to buy the popular BitTorrent site The Pirate Bay. It also announced its intention to buy shares of Swedish P2P company Peerialism AB. Peerialism develops solutions for data distribution and distributed storage based on new P2P technology. The transaction was planned to take place in August 2009. Due to the buyers' financial troubles, the site was not sold. One week prior to the announcement, trading in GGF's stock was shut down after an unusually large rise in the volume of trades. The company is suspected of insider trading."

GO-Global displays the application's user interface on personal computers and other client devices running a variety of operating systems, including UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows Mobile, and Pocket PC. GO-Global can be used to Web-enable existing applications without the need to modify existing code. Applications appear on the client device either in a Web browser or within a loose window on the desktop. GO-Global is a server-based computing product that can, among other things, provide two-tier, client–server applications with many of the benefits of a three-tier architecture, or cloud computing (server-based computing). With GO-Global, users can connect to applications remotely — from offices, homes, from the road, or anywhere Internet or dial-up connectivity is available. Applications are installed on a central server, but look and feel like the natively-run, locally installed application. Local and remote users can log on to their company’s server and have secure access to all the applications and data they use at work, including email, office productivity suites, management applications, and custom software. GO-Global can run any application on a central computer and thereby allows desktop and productivity applications to be accessed on-demand from any location, in a software as a service deployment model. This is in contrast to appstreaming systems, in which the applications, while still stored on a central server, are streamed to the client on-demand and then executed on the client machine. GO-Global remotes the user interface of existing applications without requiring any changes to the application's code. Remoting can be done by either displaying application windows as if they were native applications, or as pages inside a web browser, as if applications were Web 2.0 Rich Internet Applications. GO-Global delivers the application's user interface over the Internet. It does not provide full control of a computer over the net, as KVM software does."

G-Force race cars won 4 Indianapolis 500's, and 2 IRL Championships. G-Force was purchased by Élan Motorsport Technologies in 2002 and all manufacturing was moved to Elan's facilities in Braselton, GA. Ken Anderson would leave to form Falcon Cars with Michael Kranefuss to build a competing chassis for the 2004 IRL season. Former Lola designer Simon Marshall would be brought on to design its new IRL chassis for 2004 which was branded the Panoz G-Force. During the winter of 2004, all remaining G-Force operations in England were moved to Braselton, GA and the England operations of G-Force were shut down. By the start of the 2005 season, the G-Force name was retired."

Before 2005, the Gasunie was authorized to both sell and transport natural gas discovered in the Netherlands. Due to the liberalisation of the European gas market, transportation and trade and supply had to be separated into independent companies. In 2005, this separation took place, creating both GasTerra and a natural gas transportation company. The last company kept the original name, Gasunie."

  "text" : "General Tobacco, formally known as the Vibo Corporation, was a tobacco company based in Mayodan, North Carolina. Founded by Vidal Suriel in 1997, with its first brand reaching the market in 2000, the company was at one point the fifth top tobacco company in the United States. Known for the Bronco, Silver, and GT-One brands, General Tobacco specialized in low-cost brands, but the company's market share was undercut in its final years of production by other discounters. In addition, the company was a late participant in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, joining the agreement nearly six years after the agreement was originally put in place. The company later claimed that while joining the agreement was essential to have access to the American market, by signing late they were forced to pay a larger amount than the 19 original signatories, and that it was \"misled\" into participating. The company was eventually barred from selling its brands in several states because it was unable to meet back payments for cigarette sales before 2004, as was required by the agreement. Due to these and other factors, General Tobacco ceased production at the end of 2010, although representatives of the company were still pursuing legal options as recently as 2012."

  "text" : "GoGirl is an American brand of female urination device introduced in 2009. A CNN video news story that year described the product as a \"cultural phenomenon\". Personal hygiene products that aid women in urinating while standing up are not new. The GoGirl product is based on a 20-year-old design by a doctor. It was rebranded and relaunched in January 2009 at the Minnesota State Fair in St. Paul, Minnesota by FemMed, a company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. It is a vessel made of flexible pink or purple medical-grade silicone with a splash guard on one end which the operator presses against her body. It has a spout on the other side, out of which the urine streams by pressure from a woman's natural flow. GoGirl was CAD engineered and refined as a design over ten years to fit a woman's body. The product is made from a \"class IV\" medical grade silicone, which is more supple than many rubber or silicone products. GoGirl is naturally hypoallergenic. GoGirl works with a woman's body to create pressure which creates less spray and splatter. The product comes as a kit in a small tube with the GoGirl, tissues and a storage baggie. It is designed to be a compact travel aid. In 2013 GoGirl added an extension tube to its product, which may meet special military or medical needs. As of 2014, GoGirl can be found in more than 3,500 US retail locations and in more than 45 countries."

  "text" : "George Fincham (20 August 1828 — 21 December 1910) was an organ builder active in Australia. Fincham was born in London; his father (Jonathan George Fincham) and grandfather were both organ builders and so it is not surprising he practised this trade himself. He was apprenticed in 1842–49 to the London organ builder Henry Bevington, and then worked as a foreman for James Bishop & Son. Fincham emigrated to Australia in 1852 and started working as an organ tuner and repairer 113 Queen Street in Melbourne. In 1853 he went to the diggings at Ballarat. He returned to Melbourne in 1854 and worked as a builder on the Spencer Street railway station. Within ten years of his arrival in Australia he had raised sufficient funds to equip a workshop and buy stock to begin organ building as George Fincham & Sons. Also by this time churches had funds for pipe organs and interest in organ music was growing, helped by the arrival of organists such as Charles Horsley, David Lee and the Revd George Torrance in Australia. The organ building business grew and by 1904 he had a branches in Adelaide and Sydney, and agents in Perth and Brisbane. Altogether he built about 200 organs for cathedrals and churches and supplied pipe work and parts to organ builders throughout Australasia. His integrity and the quality of the organs he built overcame the prejudice towards colonial work. He was outstanding among Australian organ builders for his skill, his business ability and his readiness to keep pace with modern trends. He patented many improvements; most of the organs he built had mechanical action and from 1886 some had tubular-pneumatic. Fincham died in Melbourne in 1910. His company, continued by his sons and grandsons, completed many projects in more than a century of organ building. It closed down in February 2006."

Google China executives had also publicly condemned the necessity of filtering search results in line with the Golden Shield Project (also known as the Great Firewall of China), which some commentators have stated appears to run counter to Google's mantra, Don't be evil. Goojjee, founded on January 14, 2010 also allows searches to be run, but apparently uses Google and Baidu to do the actual searches.

  "text" : "Graf Brothers Flooring and Lumber specializes in, and is the world's largest manufacturer of, rift and quarter sawn oak products. Rift & Quartered lumber results from a unique way of sawing that maximizes the yield of lumber with vertical grain. Vertical grain is preferred because of its excellent technical properties. Lumber that has been sawed using this method expands evenly and vertically. Vertical grain also increases the structural integrity of the wood. Graf Bros produces 125,000 board feet (290 m3) of lumber and 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2) of flooring per day. The company maintains 2,500,000 board feet (5,900 m3) of logs, 5,000,000 board feet (10,000 m3) of lumber and 750,000 square feet (70,000 m2) of flooring in inventory, including stocks at four West Coast warehouses. Graf Brothers sells approximately half of its lumber to distribution yards and flooring and millwork manufacturers, and the other half goes into its own flooring production. Graf Bros maintains lumber inventory at four different warehouses on the West Coast. The company's flooring is shipped to distributors in Europe, Japan, and Asia, as well as 260 flooring distributors in North America. Graf Brothers also has a sales office in Brussels, Belgium. Graf Brothers' headquarters and main sales office is a site of 70 acres (300,000 m2) in South Shore, Kentucky. This area houses a log yard of 5 acres (20,000 m2) that can hold up to 3,000,000 board feet (7,000 m3) of logs under water, an ultra high-tech band mill, 18 kilns capable of drying 2 MMBF of lumber per month, a Walnut steamer, several warehouses, and two state-of-the-art computerized rip lines for manufacturing ripped-to-width lumber and flooring blanks. All of these facilities have been built since the site was acquired in 2003. Graf Brothers also operates satellite log yards in Vanceburg, Kentucky, and Chillicothe, Ohio. In addition to its own mill, Graf Brothers is supplied by two dedicated contract sawmills, Brown Brothers Lumber in Otway, Ohio, and Redoutey Lumber in Henley, Ohio. Appalachian Wood Floors (AWF), owned by the Grafs' brother Jim, molds the flooring exclusively for Graf Brothers at its plant in nearby Portsmouth, Ohio. Graf Bros partakes in two practices that are unique to the lumber and flooring industries. The first is the production of \"Monster Boards\", which are boards with width offerings ranging from 9 to 32 inches. The second unique practice is offering sorted or fixed widths in rift and quarter sawn lumber in almost any width the customer wants."

  "text" : "Grad Associates formerly Grad Partnership and Frank Grad & Sons, was an architectural firm based in Newark, New Jersey. Founded in 1906 by Frank Grad (1882–1968), the company was later run by his sons, Bernard (d. August 4, 2000) and Howard (d. 1992). The company closed its doors on February 19, 2010. Born in Austria, Frank Grad was educated at the Newark Arts School (the forerunner of Arts High School). He began his Newark architectural practice in 1906. Grad was capable of working in many styles, from the Beaux-Arts, YMHA on MLK Boulevard, to the Spanish colonial Stanley Theater and Beth Israel Hospital, to the Neo-Classical Newark Symphony Hall, to the Art Deco 1180 Raymond Boulevard (aka, the Lefcourt Building). Several of Grad's greatest commissions, the YMHA, the Stanley Theater, Beth Israel, and the Lefcourt Building, were for Jewish patrons. In the mid-1930s the name became Frank Grad & Sons. Grad died in 1968. His firm, Grad Associates was continued by his sons after Grad died. Grad Associates peaked in the 1980s when there were over 130 architects working there but closed in the winter of 2010, a victim of the Great Recession. The firm added new partners in 1966, and became the Grad Partnership. In 1990 the firm, became GRAD Associates, P.A. At the time the firm closed the managing partners were Allen Trousdale and Vasant Kshirsagar. Grad was one of the first large firms in the New York region to invest in extensive computer-aided design facilities."

We started in 2009 with the intent of reversing the flow of information, that is, to make it bottom-up instead of top-down. Using simple technologies and social context to design tools, we have been able to impact communities at large - more than 2 million users in over 7 Indian States, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Namibia and South Africa. More interesting than this are the outcomes of what we have done: Forty rural radio stations are able to manage and share content over mobiles and the web, corrupt ration shop officials in Jharkhand were arrested due to citizen complaints made on our platform, Women Sarpanches in Uttar Pradesh shared learning and opinions on their work with senior government officials, and citizens were able to monitor and report on waste management in 18 wards of Delhi to hold MCD officials accountable for their work. Gram Vaani has won several awards, including: \n*  The Knight News Challenge in 2008 \n*  The Manthan Awards in 2009 \n*  The Economic Times Power of Ideas awards in 2010 \n*  The Rising Stars in Global Health award in 2012 \n*  The mBillionth Award South Asia in 2012 and 2013"

  "text" : "Geoservices is an upstream oilfield service company founded in 1958 by Gaston Rebilly. Geoservices is the industry leader in surface logging, focusing on drilling support and formation evaluation. Our portfolio of technologies and services deliver actionable information on reservoir fluid composition, lithology, well placement, reservoir connectivity, and compartmentalization to guide critical decisions for optimal drilling, completions, and ultimate recovery. Surface Logging Services: Accurate and timely monitoring of the lithology and pore fluid composition of the formations being drilled supports critical decisions that help drill wells more efficiently into potential pay zones.Specialized surface-located sensors measure mechanical, hydraulic, and engineering data while drilling, providing the basis for calculating parameters such as mud pit volumes, mud flow rate, mud weight in the shale shaker area, mud gas level, and return flow rate. This information helps detect unbalanced formation fluid pressures,optimizes the drilling process, and maintains safe operating environment. Drilling services:Drilling performance services: A key part of drilling is managing risk in ways that make it possible to achieve high performance in wells and borehole sections where drilling efficiency is the priority. Drillers benefit from recommendations to improve downhole performance in real time based on measurement and analysis of surface parameters.Wellbore quality services: A range of drilling parameters related to pore pressure, hole cleaning, and wellbore stability are provided through 24/7 real-time surface monitoring and data analysis combined with predictive models. These help identify drilling risks and operational issues early, minimize non-productive time (NPT) and invisible lost time (ILT), and increase drilling efficiency, with minimal reservoir interference and maximum returns. Surface formation evaluation services: Fluid logging and analysis services at the surface provide the first insight into reservoir fluid composition. Advanced real-time quantitative mineralogical and petrophysical analyses of cuttings and isotope logging help identify lithology for formation evaluation, geosteering, and well placement. Rig operations surveillance: Geoservices offers the latest in digital surveillance technology - a superior digital alternative to traditional analog instrumentation and driller’s consoles (primary instrumentation systems) that alsofunctions as an advanced electronic drilling recorder with multiple built-in capabilities. The system enables drillers and their crews to increase the efficiency of daily rig operations by reducing NPT, lowering costs, and increasing operational safety. Built specifically as an unmanned system, it connects rig and onshore personnel, enabling the sharing of wellsite information such as real-time drilling data and reports in a variety of formats."

It is open 24 hours a day, and is known for being commonly considered to be the birthplace of the authentic New York City-style egg cream, which its awning describes as \"New York's Best.\" It does not stock pornographic magazines, and it gets magazines delivered one or two days before other New York City newsstands. In the 1950s, Gem Spa was a gathering place for beats, and in the 1960s it was a hippie hangout, known for selling a wide selection of underground newspapers. New York Magazine named it the best newsstand in the East Village in 2001, and it has been featured on television programs about food, including Kelly Choi's Secrets of New York. The building in which Gem Spa is located, 131 Second Avenue, or 36 St. Marks Place, was built in 1898-1900 and was designed by Louis F. Heinecke in the Renaissance Revival style. It is located within the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District, which was created in October 2012."

Glastron is known for its boat hull design innovations, including the Aqualift and \"SSV\" hull designs, the latter of which is still in use today. Glastron's \"Glastonbury\" boats were featured in the James Bond film Live and Let Die. A boat chase was filmed in Louisiana around the Irish Bayou area. Twenty-six boats were built by Glastron for the film, of which seventeen were destroyed during rehearsals. The speedboat jump scene over the bayou, filmed with the assistance of a specially-constructed ramp, unintentionally set a Guinness World Record at the time with 110 feet (34 m) cleared. The waves created by the impact caused the following boat to flip over."

The company also operates store-within-a-store kiosks at Canadian Costco locations under the Wireless etc. brand, and operated as Target Mobile at Target locations in Canada until the chain's closure. In 2010, the company first expanded into the United States with its acquisition of Verizon Wireless retail chain Diamond Wireless. On November 28, 2014, BCE Inc. announced that it would acquire Glentel for $670 million, pending regulatory approval, in an effort to boost its retail presence. After a dispute with Rogers, who argued that it was contractually required to consent to any change in ownership of the company, Bell announced that it would divest a 50% stake in Glentel to Rogers upon the closure of the acquisition, turning the company into a 50/50 joint venture between the rival firms."

  "text" : "General Motors Egypt S.A.E. (جنرال موتورز مصر, or short GME) is a car and motor vehicle manufacturer based in Maadi, Cairo, Egypt. The company's car factory is located in the 6th of October City and is one of the direct neighbors of the Egyptian German Automotive Company. Despite its name, the company is not a part of the General Motors Company, but only a joint venture with the local importer and car dealer Al-Monsour Automotive Company. Al-Monsour is the largest shareholder and with more than 1,000 workers the official owner and operator of the plant. After eight years of successful cooperation with the U.S. American General Motors starting in 1975, the dealer made a proposal to build a production plant in Egypt. So the company was founded in the same year. One year later, the plant was opened in an internal opening ceremony. At the official plant opening in 1985 the first cars rolled off the company's production line. The opening speech was given by the former President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak. In 1987, continuous production finally started. The company was at this time only active as an automotive supplier. The first product was the chassis for the Isuzu TF which was assembled locally by another car assembler as the Chevrolet T Series. In their own plant, production of the Chevrolet Mini Bus began, which was based on the same platform. In 1993, the Mini Bus was replaced by the Opel Vectra. In the following year, GM Egypt began the assembling of the CKD imported Opel Corsa. In 1996 the 100,000th vehicle left the production plant. In the same year, GM Egypt was honored by General Motors as the best producer of Opel vehicles worldwide, on account of the production quality of the vehicles. In the following year, the company achieved an annual production capacity of 24,225 units. In 1998, two models were replaced by their newer generation. The old Isuzu TF was replaced by the new Isuzu Rodeo and the Chevrolet T Series was replaced by the identical Chevrolet Frontera. After 72 months of manufacturing of the successful Opel Vectra, GM Egypt improved the quality of the model and hoped this would achieve higher sales. The old model was now only faced as the new generation. For the exhibited posters and TV commercials participating in the American University Annual Advertising Competition, the GME was awarded with the bronze medal. ISO 9002 certification followed in 1992. In 2000 the Opel Astra was adopted to the model lineup which was an CKD assembled model also. A short time later, the production of the 200,000th vehicle was celebrated. In 2001, GME received its second certification to ensure a safe and healthy working environment in accordance with ISO 14001. In the same year the contract with the Al-Monsour Automotive Company expired which was subsequently replaced by a new contract. General Motors Egypt began the full manufacturing of the Opel Astra Sedan and Opel Corsa Sedan in 2002. The Opel Vectra was renewed to its current generation at this time. As import models the Chevrolet Aveo and Chevrolet Optra was launched in the Egyptian market in 2005. New vehicles manufactured by GME are the models Chevrolet Crew Cab and the identical Chevrolet T Series. Their own production of the Chevrolet Aveo began in 2007 at the GME plant. One year later GME began manufacturing the Chevrolet Lanos in different luxury versions parallel to the sporty model versions from the Speranza manufacturing. In 2009 GME began making the Chevrolet Captiva, Chevrolet Cruze and the Chevrolet N200. The last of these is exported to South American markets. The import models since 2009 are the Chevrolet N Series, Opel Astra, Opel Corsa and the Opel Insignia. On 15 August 2013, General Motors Egypt suspended operations due to the ongoing violence and political unrest in the country, but reopened it 3 days later again."

  "text" : "Gamerang is an American subscription-based online video game rental service that specializes in providing game titles for popular gaming platforms, including handheld game consoles and other mobile devices. Gamerang operates its rental service similarly to online video rental services such as Netflix and Blockbuster Online. Members pay a monthly fee and receive video games delivered to their homes via United States Postal Service First Class Mail, using pre-paid mailers. Subscribers keep the games as long as they wish and may return them at any time, as long as an account is paid in good standing. Once the returned game is received by the distribution center, the next game on a user's Game Queue, or list of game titles prioritized in order of desired delivery, is sent. Members also are provided the option to purchase games they have rented rather than send them back, as well as to purchase new and previously-played games directly from the Gamerang website. Gamerang is ranked #2 on TopTenREVIEWS' list of Online Video Game Rentals, and site editors have indicated that \"Gamerang has one of the largest and most comprehensive game libraries on the internet and with just a little more innovation, this service could be a real force to reckon with.\""

  "text" : "Gecina is a residential, office, and healthcare focused real estate investment trust (REIT). Its portfolio of properties also includes shopping malls, warehouses, and logistic centers responsible for coordinating commercial businesses such as those operating in business parks. Almost all of its business comes from France (in 2009 only 1% of assets were abroad) where it dominates the Paris market (is the largest residential and commercial property owner, France is the 2nd biggest market for real estate in Europe outside London). Outside Paris it has traditionally been a large investor in Lyon. As of 2010 Gecina is reducing its interest in some business lines such as warehouses because of their limited market growth potential. The company has the third highest asset value among European REITs, largest French SIIC by market cap and second largest publicly traded property company in France (next to Fonciere des Regions and Icade). 88% of business comes from only two of five business segments (offices and residential) and in March 2010 it had a market cap of $6.6 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year 83% of rental revenue came from the Paris region (47% from the city core), 15% from elsewhere in France (40% of that from Lyon) and 2% from abroad. Leading revenue generating assets were offices (54%) followed by residential structures (30%). Healthcare (8%), logistics (5%) and hotels (2%) contributed a combined 15%. Gecina is a constituent of the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe index and a member of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA)."

  "text" : "Gaspereau Press is a Canadian book publishing company, based in Kentville, Nova Scotia. Established in 1997 by Andrew Steeves and Gary Dunfield, the company's philosophy emphasizes \"making books that reinstate the importance of the book as a physical object\", maintaining control over the design and the manufacturing quality of its titles as one of the few Canadian publishing houses that continues to print and bind its own books in-house. The company attracted press attention in 2010 when one of its titles, Johanna Skibsrud's novel The Sentimentalists, won the Scotiabank Giller Prize. The book, which had been rejected by several larger publishing houses before Gaspereau picked it up, had originally been published in a limited run of just 800 copies; however, the award win pushed demand for the book well beyond the 1,000 copies per week that the company's printing press could produce at maximum capacity, resulting in the book being unavailable in stores for almost two weeks after the Giller announcement. The company in the meantime announced that it had sold the novel's trade paperback rights to Douglas & McIntyre, while it will continue to print a smaller run of the novel's original edition for book collectors."

In 2014, the convention was expanded to include presenters from Victoria Video Game CEO Alliance, and the venue was changed from the George R. Pearkes Arena in Saanich, BC, Canada to the Victoria Conference Centre at 720 Douglas St, Victoria, BC, Canada. The final GottaCon convention took place February 27 through March 1, 2015.

  "text" : "Gibson Brands, Inc. (formerly Gibson Guitar Corp.) is an American manufacturer of guitars and other instruments, now based in Nashville, Tennessee. The company was formerly known as Gibson Guitar Corp. and renamed Gibson Brands, Inc. on June 11, 2013. Orville Gibson founded the company in 1902 as The Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co., Ltd. in Kalamazoo, Michigan to make mandolin-family instruments. Gibson invented archtop guitars by constructing the same type of carved, arched tops used on violins. By the 1930s, the company was also making flattop acoustic guitars, as well as one of the first commercially available hollow-body electric guitars, used and popularized by Charlie Christian. In 1944, Gibson was bought by Chicago Musical Instruments (CMI) which was acquired in 1969 by Panama-based conglomerate, Ecuadorian Company Limited (E.C.L.) that changed its name in the same year to Norlin Corporation. Many observers see this as the beginning of an era of mismanagement. Gibson sells guitars under a variety of brand names and builds one of the world's most iconic guitars, the Gibson Les Paul. Many Gibson instruments are highly collectible. Gibson was at the forefront of innovation in acoustic guitars, especially in the big band era of the 1930s; the Gibson Super 400 was widely imitated. In 1952, Gibson introduced its first solid-body electric guitar, the Les Paul which became its most popular guitar to date— designed by Ted McCarty and Les Paul. Gibson was owned by the Norlin corporation from 1969 to 1986. In 1986, the company was acquired by its present owners. Gibson is a privately held corporation owned by its chief executive officer Henry Juszkiewicz and its president David H. Berryman. In addition to guitars, Gibson offers consumer audio equipment devices through its subsidiaries Onkyo Corporation, Cerwin Vega and Stanton, as well as professional audio equipment from KRK Systems also pianos from their wholly owned subsidiary Baldwin Piano and music software from Cakewalk."

  "text" : "GenSpera, Inc. (OTC:QB GNSZ) is a development-stage pharmaceutical company based in San Antonio, Texas. The company is focused on therapeutics that deliver a cancer-destroying drug directly to the tumor or its supporting environment, the tumor vasculature. The company's prodrug technology renders the drug inactive until it encounters the programmed target, thereby delivering the cytotoxin directly to the cancer or the vessels that support it, while potentially avoiding the side effects associated with current chemotherapies. A prodrug is an inactive precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form at a targeted site. GenSpera's lead drug candidate, G-202, is currently in a Phase II clinical trial for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose disease has failed to improve on standard therapy for this indication. G-202 is also being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in glioblastoma patients with recurrent disease after surgery and/or radiation treatment of the primary tumor. G-202 targets the enzyme PSMA, found on the walls of blood vessels that feed most cancerous tumors, destroying the tumor blood supply. In contrast with anti-angiogenic agents, G-202 destroys existing as well as new cancer blood vessels. G-202 received Orphan Drug Designation from U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HCC, the most common form of primary liver cancer. The company also holds patents on prodrug candidates that target the prostate-specific enzymes Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Human Glandular Kallikrein (hK2). These candidates are expected to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancer. The active ingredient in G-202 is a chemotherapeutic agent derived from thapsigargin, a plant-based cytotoxin that kills by disrupting the calcium balance in cancer cells. GenSpera's prodrug delivery system keeps the thapsigargin inactive in the body until it finds cells that it has been programmed to seek. Once those cells in the body are found, the prodrug releases its active ingredient and destroys all of the targeted cells. The National Cancer Institute had previously demonstrated that thaspigargin was ten-to-a-hundredfold more potent than traditional chemotherapeutic agents in killing all types of cells. Thapsigargin kills cells irrespective of the rate of cell division, which may provide an effective approach to kill both fast- and slow-growing cancers as well as cancer stem cells."

Genius Crowds launched its first product in 2012. Submitting ideas to the site was free of charge. The community critiqued them and chose \"crowd favorites,\" while a panel of retailers, manufacturers and Genius Crowd staffers assessed the ideas for marketability and selected those that hold promise. C.J. Kettler describes in an interview more details about Genius Crowds and the intention of the platform. Genius Crowds \"taps everyday consumers for product ideas and then brings the best concepts to market\". The website culls through submissions and brings the best ideas to life. The website was closed in 2013."

GenArts creates visual effects software and plugins that integrate visual effects such as glows, lightning, fire and fluids into post-production video editing software from companies like Apple, Adobe, Autodesk and The Foundry. GenArts is best known for its traditional role in high-end production environments, where high budget and broadly distributed video content is being created by a large corporation. This has changed since 2008, when new leadership, product development and a series of acquisitions broadened GenArts' focus, product portfolio and customer base. GenArts now creates plugins developed for smaller budget video editing tools typically used by smaller studios, the videographer market, or creators of content distributed solely online on websites like YouTube."

Genel Energy was created in 2011 as a result of the reverse acquisition of Turkish Genel Enerji by Tony Hayward led investment company Vallares. Vallares was set up by Tony Hayward, financier Nat Rothschild and banker Julian Metherell. Genel Enerji was controlled by Mehmet Emin Karamehmet through Çukurova Group (56%) and Mehmet Sepil's family (44%). In 2009, Genel Enerji planned merger with Heritage Oil; however, the deal subsequently collapsed. Tony Hayward is CEO of Genel Energy while former CEO of Genel Enerji Mehmet Sepil became President of the company. The Board includes former deputy chief executive of BP and chairman of Petrofac, Rodney Chase. The company is listed at the London Stock Exchange. 50% of Genel Energy is owned by investors of former Vallares, which has merged with Genel Energy."

  "text" : "Grinbath, LLC is an American computer software and hardware company, located in Lubbock, Texas, United States, that currently designs and sells eye-controlled technologies for research and related markets. Previously, Grinbath made the EyeGuide Tracker, an affordable and effective eye tracking device compatible for lab use. Following the success of the EyeGuide Tracker, Grinbath set out to create its newest product: the EyeGuide Mobile Tracker. Grinbath also created the EyeGuide platform, or \"EG\". The EyeGuide Mobile Tracker includes the addition of a second scene camera, along with live data download via wireless protocol, real-time, field-based research beyond the screen, including retail marketing, sports training, even eye disorder diagnosis. The EyeGuide® Mobile Tracker was designed for precision and flexibility, providing users with eye tracking technology to use in almost any environment. The mobility and flexibility of the EyeGuide Mobile Tracker provide added benefit to sports research, medical research video game testing and gameplay, academics, military research, training and many more industries. EyeGuide or \"EG\" for short was developed so users can take the core EyeGuide technology and integrate it into other products such as football and military helmets, glasses, video game accessories, and medical equipment. In a first-person shooter game, for example, as the player's head moves, the avatar would move correspondingly on the screen—up, down, or side to side. As the player looks at a target, the avatar would focus in precisely on that target, resulting in faster, more natural, immersive game play. It is an intended stepping stone for augmented reality applications visualized and controlled directly via the eyes. The company was founded in 2010 by Dr. Brian Still at Texas Tech University. EyeGuide was developed as an affordable alternative to other eye trackers for the Texas Tech University’s usability lab. Grinbath was selected in 2013 to be a finalist in the SXSW Interactive Accelerator Competition."

Its founding officers were Eugene F. Enslen, president; Ike Adler, vice-president; John Kyser, secretary and treasurer; and Eugene F. Enslen, Jr., general manager. In early 1910, it announced a Model \"50\" touring car with a wheel base of 124 inches, a 5.25x6 inches bore and stroke engine, capable of 60 bhp. In 1912, it opened salesrooms in the Empire Building, then the tallest building in Birmingham. The manager was W. O. Fields. In 1913, it was manufacturing two models: \n* Great Southern 30, available in two-seater roadster and five-seater touring bodies for $1400. \n* Great Southern 51, available in a six-seater touring body for $2100. In 1914, it dropped the Great Southern 30, and concentrated on the manufacture of just the Great Southern 50 chassis, formerly titled the Great Southern 51. The new 50 model was a seven passenger touring body. By 1915, it was manufacturing a chassis and body for a \"one-man, pay-enter\" motor bus that was 22 feet long, 8 feet 9 inches high, 7 feet 6 inches wide, rated at 2.25 tons capacity, and could carry 25 passengers. The company went bankrupt in 1917. Alabama's other pre-1950 car manufactures include Preston Motor's Premocar in Birmingham and Keller in Huntsville."

To date, it has received $19 million USD in seed funding. The company currently operates rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Austin, Portland, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Similar to other car sharing services such as Zipcar, Getaround utilizes the economic principles of collaborative consumption. However, the peer-to-peer rental model doesn’t require the company to maintain a fleet of vehicles; rather, owners manage and maintain their own vehicles."

RediAuto Sport was marketed as “America’s only supplier of sports cars for disabled drivers.” Products included a “RediAuto System” consisting of a hand operated clutch for manual shift vehicles, a steering wheel mounted accelerator ring, and a hand operated brake. Soft Touch was advertised as a luxury product line and had only one product: an expensive gas and brake controller. The company promoted motor sports for disabled drivers by supplying specially outfitted racecars, supporting drivers at local race courses, and sponsoring the RediaAuto Sport Track Challenge and the 2007 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. The July 2007 issue of Motor Trend Magazine described the GO products as “The future of hand controls.\" As the great recession took its toll on upscale brands and discretionary spending, GO sales fell dramatically. By the end of 2008 GO had ceased distribution of the RediAuto Sport and Soft Touch product lines and in 2009 the company began road trials on a low cost vehicle hand control system constructed of high tech polymers."

  "text" : "Grotrian-Steinweg, known as Grotrian in the US, is a German manufacturer of luxury pianos. The company is based in Braunschweig, Germany, commonly known as Brunswick in English. Grotrian-Steinweg makes premium grand pianos and upright pianos. Grotrian-Steinweg's history dates back to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry Steinway after his emigration to the US where he founded Steinway & Sons). In 1856, Friedrich Grotrian became a partner; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory and the right to market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand. Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company to become one of the finest piano manufacturers in Germany. Grotrian-Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists, and they received accolades at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Grotrian-Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall, and established sales rooms in a half dozen major cities in Germany, and by 1920, in London as well. At its peak in the late 1920s, Grotrian-Steinweg employed 1,000 people and made 3,000 pianos per year. Economic depression in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian-Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely. The family rebuilt the factory and re-established its reputation for quality work. In the 1950s, an annual piano-playing competition was founded by the company, to identify promising young piano students. Grotrian-Steinweg sought to expand into the US in the mid-1960s. Steinway & Sons sued to prevent them from using the Steinweg name, resulting in a 1975 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The case set a precedent in describing \"initial interest confusion\": that the brand Grotrian-Steinweg could cause piano buyers to temporarily confuse its brand with the brand Steinway & Sons. The court ordered Grotrian-Steinweg to stop selling pianos in the US under the \"Steinweg\" name. Afterward, the company formed a business entity named Grotrian Piano Company, through which it sells pianos in North America."

As of August 2014, the company had no marketed products. GlobeImmune’s therapeutic vaccines are developed on the company’s Tarmogen immunotherapy platform. Tarmogens are made from genetically modified yeast that express one or more disease-associated antigens. Tarmogens activate T cells to specifically target and eliminate diseased cells with the same target antigen. The company has partnerships with Celgene (established in 2009) and the National Cancer Institute for the development of cancer vaccines, and with Gilead for the development of therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of hepatitis B. With respect to financing in the absence of revenue, the company raised US$17,500,000 through a Series E Preferred Stock offering in January 2010. As of August 2015, GlobeImmune had two therapeutic vaccines in clinical trials, GI-6207 and GI-6301, for the treatment of various cancers. Completed trials have addressed two other candidates, GI-4000 (the company's lead oncology candidate as of 2010) and GI-5005. Despite there being three ongoing trials, in July 2015 the company announced it would eliminate \"most of its workforce positions\" shortly following the failure of a trial examining GI-4774."

  "text" : "Giraffas (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʒiˈɾafɐs]) is a Brazilian fast-food chain founded in August 1981 by two friends, Mauro Lacerda and Muniz Neto. Its first store located in Brazil's capital city, Brasília. In 1991, the chain began franchising, and it has since expanded across Brazil. It has also opened in Paraguay and in Miami in the U.S. The company experienced difficulties after the implementation of the Real Plan. With the fall in inflation, earnings decreased and the model used by the partners proved to be unviable, soon as the company went into receivership. In 1996, due to financial crisis, the chain was sold to three friends of the owners: Felipe Barreto, Luciana Morais e Luciana Vasconcelos. The trio, completely inexperienced in the business, invested in the franchise system to grow and in 1998 broke the ten unique shops in possession of the company inherited from the former administration. In 2002, the chain had the highest growth proportional in the national segment, and in 2003 the chain achieved 21% growth, opening the first stores in the states of Espírito Santo and Paraná. In 2004 and 2005, the company's main focus was the diversification of products, including a Giraffas ice cream kiosk. In 2005 was opened the first store in the town of Barreiras, in Bahia. In 2006, the chain celebrated 25 years with a festival of local rock bands in Brasília, called Giraffestival. At the same time the company reached the milestone of 200 stores throughout Brazil and inaugurated the first stores in Pará and Mato Grosso. In 2006 was also launched the Trio RBD, a special offer with gifts from the Mexican band RBD. In 2007, is opened the first store in the state of Tocantins. Giraffas opened its first international store in Miami, U.S. Giraffas plans to open five stores in the country by 2011 and fifty stores in ten years. In addition to this store in the U.S. that premiered in 2010, Giraffas invested in a new international store in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay which debuted in 2011. The chain is now in Brazil compared with other major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Burger King."

As of 2008, the company has a strong presence in 2nd and 3rd tier Chinese cities, large and medium-sized cities that aren't one of the top four in terms of population and contribution to GDP. In 2008, Giant Interactive had the third-largest share of the Chinese online games market with 11.9%, and a BNP Paribas media unit called the company \"the industry leader of online games in China.\" It was founded in 2001 as Shanghai Zhengtu Network Technology Co Ltd. Listed on the NYSE in 2007, in late 2013 the company was planning to be taken private (and subsequently delisted from the exchange). As of April 2014, this go-private plan had yet to be completed amid a lawsuit filed by shareholders to prevent the sale. By July 2014, the company had gone private in a $3 billion merger with Giant Merger Ltd. Some of its games, such as ZT Online, derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods. In 2013, peak concurrent users for ZT Online 2 reached 540,000. The company may be a partner of site 51.com offering casual games. Giant Interactive also makes mobile games some in partnership with Ntreev Soft. It has an architecturally daring corporate headquarters on the outskirts of Shanghai designed by Morphosis."

  "text" : "Gyro Motor Company was an American aircraft engine manufacturer. The Gyro motor company was formed in 1909 by Emile Berliner to pursue production of rotary engines. His designs were improvements of the Addams-Farwell rotary engine Berliner used in early helicopter experiments. The engines at the time of his 1901 experiments were 20 lbs per hp. Addams-Farwell built a custom engine that weighed 3-4 lb per hp. Berliner donated the engine to the National Air and Space Museum, and pursued his own advanced version. He built a small factory on 744 Girard Street in Washington D.C. next to another small factory for his Victor record players.Gyro incorporated with $100,000 in stock in 1911 and manufactured three varieties of the rotary engine. A Three, Five and Seven cylinder model each with the same bore and stroke. His engines featured a 40 lb cast nickel-steel cylinder assembly that was machined down to just 6 1/2 pounds with spiraling cooling fins adding strength. Emile experimented with graphite powder suspended in the fuel as a method of light-weight lubrication. A monoplane built by the Washington Aeroplane Company set an American endurance record with a Gyro Seven cylinder engine of 4 hours and 23 minutes in the air. In December 1912, Berliner traveled to Germany and set up a German manufacturing component in Adlershof to market the Gyro engines with a $500,000 capitalization. In London, pilot Beatty demonstrated a Wright aircraft retrofitted with a 50 hp Gyro engine. The Gyro progressed to 80 hp in the seven cylinder model by 1913, and up to 110 hp in the Model L nine cylinder \"Duplex\" with a uniqure cam driven exhaust valve. The French Gnome Omega and future variants proved to be more popular in sales. Motorenfabrik Oberursel developed its own rotary from the Gnome Monosoupape that would power many WWI fighters. In June 1914, Berliner's nephew, Joseph Sanders became the general manager. He purchased the assets in May 1917, forming the Gyro Company. Gyro motor production did not continue past WWI, when a flood of advanced designs were introduced to the market."

In 1895, after he purchased half of the company, Pratt became treasurer and manager and after he purchased the rest of the company, he renamed it the Goodell-Pratt Company. In 1925 Goodell-Pratt purchased the A.F. Way Company's electric drill operations and began to produce power tools. By 1929 Goodell-Pratt had three production facilities and was producing 1500 separate tools. With the advent of the economic slowdown that resulted from 1929 stock market crash, the Goodell-Pratt's excess capacity was a drag on its profits. Goodell-Pratt's stock went to fifty cents a share and it was purchased by the Millers Falls Company, in 1931 Goodell-Pratt was merged into the Millers Falls Company."

Gunnar eyewear has received considerable attention in technical media reviews, including PCWorld, Lifehacker, Huffington Post, and Gizmodo. The company sells its eyeglasses online on its website, as well as at retail stores, including Best Buy. The company makes marketing claims that the eyewear improves contrast and comfort, while reducing eye fatigue and visual stress, especially for people who spend many hours staring at digital displays. A Pacific University research study of 36 participants did in fact find significant differences in irritation or burning of the eyes, tearing, or watery eyes, dry eyes, and tired eyes, that were each improved by Gunnar lenses versus placebo lenses.  The study also never tested the alternative method of simulating the effect of Gunnar lenses by simply adjusting the computer monitor's parameters such as brightness, contrast and color temperature. It is used to protect from LED artficial light. In a 2008 follow-up study the team was not able to reproduce the results of the first study, finding no difference in burning of the eyes, tearing, or watery eyes with Gunnar Optiks compared to placebo glasses. The study found \"[no] scientific evidence for a change in accommodation (focusing), tear volume, or electromyography of the eyelid (squinting and blinking)\"."

Gemfields produces approximately 20% of the world’s emerald supply. In July 2009, Gemfields commenced a formal auction programme for Zambian emeralds mined at Kagem. To date, the Company has held 15 auctions of rough emerald and beryl produced from Kagem which have generated revenues totalling USD 260 million. The Company has also held two traded emerald auctions (not obtained directly from the Company's own mining operations) which generated revenue of USD 22.0 million. In June 2014, Gemfields held an inaugural ruby and corundum auction in Singapore from its Mozambique operations. A total of 1.82 million carats were sold which generated total auction revenues of USD 33.5 million; The company is adamant about the traceability of its stones and has implemented a “mine to market” strategy by which emeralds are “completely traceable from mine to market”."

  "text" : "The Guitar and Lute Workshop (GLW) was a manufacturer of custom guitars, ukuleles, and period stringed instruments based in Honolulu, Hawaii between 1970 and 1976. The workshop was known primarily for the talented luthiers employed in either construction of guitars, or the musicians that taught at the workshop or that used guitars made at the workshop. Additionally, an independent piano restoration and tuning business operated above the workshop floor and studios for at least two years. The GLW was notable as a nexus of activity supporting native Hawaiian musical cultural discovery during the Second Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1970s, with key Hawaiian musicians such as Keola Beamer and Kapono Beamer gaining starts in their careers at the GLW, as well as musical instrument restoration for instruments of Hawaiian royalty (of the Kingdom of Hawaii), now curated by ʻIolani Palace. Additionally, the GLW's focus on traditional period stringed instruments was, in part, responsible for the resurgent interest in the viol and traditional luthierie methods within the western United States in the early 1970s."

After refurbishment it was planned to sell them to Greentrains who in turn would lease them back South Spur and Southern & Silverton. However Greentrains ran into trouble raising funds to complete the deal and by June 2010 Coote Industrial had converted its debt to equity giving it an 81% shareholding. As at January 2013 Greentrains owned 38 locomotives and 39 wagons. In April 2016, the majority of the locomotives were sold to Southern Shorthaul Railroad."

  "text" : "Established in 1991, Georgia SoftWorks  started as a custom software development company specializing in data communications and telecommunications applications. The company needed reliable Telnet connectivity on Windows NT with features such as: correctly displayed characters, proper function key operation and alt-key operation. At the time, Telnet was widely available on Unix but not frequently utilized on Windows in commercial environments. Georgia SoftWorks developed the GSW Telnet Server for Windows, and it named its foundation product the \"Universal Terminal Server\". It was designed so that different protocols could be installed as requirements determined. GSW added features to its telnet server such as mouse operation and file transfer over a telnet connection. After successful in-house use, the UTS was commercialized. Georgia SoftWorks developed major features for its UTS such as Logon Scripts; this feature eventually evolved into global, per user, per IP Address and Certificate Based Logon Scripts. Other features included client device failure detection, Graceful Termination, Session Saver, Automatic Logon, Session Monitoring, Shadowing and Team Services technology.

Their first game 'Kyte - Kite Flying Game' got over 250+ downloads on first day and went on to cross 10,000 downloads within its first week of launch. However, because of quality issues the game was taken off by GameEon in the month of August, 2013 but shortly after was republished and till date has crossed over 100,000 downloads. GameEon, as of November 2014, consists of a 12-member team and has its office in Mumbai, India."

This activity is collated in real time by searching through large amounts of publicly available data from the internet. “Growth Intelligence listens to the sound that companies make on the internet and the signals given off and looks at a whole range of noisy information, but together with smart machine-learning algorithms we can say something about the companies in the economy,” said Tom Gatten, CEO and founder. In July 2013 the company was commissioned by National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) to estimate the amount of UK technology companies in the UK. The research found that there were 40% more such companies than previously thought. The report received wide coverage and was discussed in The Guardian, The BBC, The Telegraph and The Financial Times."

  "text" : "The online Gandhi Heritage Portal preserves, protects, and disseminates original writings of Mohandas K. Gandhi and makes available to the world the large corpus of “Fundamental Works” which are useful for any comprehensive study of the life and thought of Gandhiji. The Government of India and its Ministry of Culture, acting on the recommendation of the Gandhi Heritage Sites Committee headed by Shri Gopal Krishna Gandhi, gave the responsibility of conceptualising, designing, developing and maintaining the Gandhi Heritage Portal to the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust. The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (100 volumes), Gandhiji No Akshar Deha (82 volumes) and Sampoorna Gandhi Vangmaya (97 volumes) form the basic structure around which the Portal has been developed. The key texts provide first editions of the Key Texts of Gandhi. These are: Hind Swaraj, Satyagraha in South Africa, An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth, From Yervada Mandir, Ashram Observances in Action, Constructive Programmes: Their Meaning and Place, Key To Health, and Gandhi's translation of the Gita as Anasakti Yoga. The Fundamental Works are those through which The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG) was created, for instance the Mahadevbhai Ni Diary. Over time the Portal plans to provide all the collected works. The Journals provide electronic versions of Indian Opinion, Navajivan, Young India, Harijan, Harijan Bandhu, and Harijan Sevak. A sub-section provides some of the journals which make for a fuller archive of the Gandhian imagination and scholarship. At present the Portal has placed as representation Gandhi Marg (Hindi & English), Bhoomi Putra, Pyara Bapu and the unique handwritten journal of the Satyagraha Ashram Madhpudo, which among other things carried Prabhudas Gandhi's Jivan Nu Parodh and Kakasaheb Kalelkar's Smaran Yatra. The Portal hopes to include many more journals as it acquires these overtime. Other Works is a section that takes into account the commentarial and memoire literature. The Life and Times section is under development, and will provide information that could lead the reader to explore the data. The Gallery will provide audio, visual, and film material as well as images of caricatures, paintings and postage stamps. The Portal provides a sample of each of these. The Gandhi Heritage Sites, under development and verification, will provide multiple layers of information regarding places that Gandhiji visited. The information will contain references to primary sources about these visits as well."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with Great Lakes Brewing Company.) Great Lakes Brewery is a craft beer brewery in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 2013 and 2014, Great Lakes won the top honour in Canadian brewing, named Canadian Brewery of the Year. Great Lakes Brewery was started in 1987 in an industrial unit in Brampton by Bruce Cornish and four other silent partners, the group produced two beers, an ale and a lager, using malt extract, a far cry from all grain used by craft breweries throughout North America. The beer was packaged in 1 litre plastic home brew bottles with a focus on the home retailer. After four years of production, Cornish and the silent partners had run out of capital to keep the brewery functioning. A construction magnate in Etobicoke by the name Peter Bulut Sr. had been introduced to Cornish through respective business deals and plans were underway to sell the brewery to him. Bulut Sr. purchased the business in 1990, made the change from malt extract brewing to all grain and in the early months of 1991 moved the brewery to its current home at 30 Queen Elizabeth Blvd just off the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) where Cornish continued on as head brewer for a short time. In 2009, with the health of Peter Bulut Sr. in decline, his children, Peter Bulut Jr. and his sister Anetta Jewell, took on more responsibility of the day-to-day operations. They, along with the brewing team, introduced new brands and marketing initiatives that led to increased sales through the LCBO, bars and restaurants. The brewing team experimented with flavours, named their beers weird and wacky names, and to showcase their creations with monthly Project X nights (no longer taking place). Bulut Sr. died in 2010, leaving the brewery to his family. Bulut Jr. took over the brewery, operating as President and Chief Brewing Officer. The brewery currently employs approximately 30 people."

Marcel Violet founded a company registered as the Société Sylla at Courbevoie on the northern side of Paris, and immediately announced his introduction of the Galba in the Spring of 1929. It was one in a succession of cars designed by Violet, a respected automobile engineer with a particular specialism in two-stroke engines. The only model was a small \"voiturette\" automobile that sat on a 2,250 mm (88.6 in) wheelbase and was powered by a 2-stroke twin cylinder engine of 564cc. The power unit was fitted at the front of the car and drove the rear wheels via a two speed transmission and a shaft-drive. Despite a long gestation period, the Galba proved short-lived. By October 1930 Marcel Violet was already producing the Huascar, a voiturette very similar to the Galba which was indeed produced at the same Courbevoie factory, but which had a slightly larger engine and was produced by a new company called \"Voiturettes Huascar\"."

  "text" : "Golden Harvest is a U.S.-based brand wholly owned by Syngenta. Syngenta markets hybrid corn seeds for agriculture under the brand. Golden Harvest Seeds, Inc. was founded April 23, 1973 when seven companies in the 13-member Funk G Hybrids conglomerate decided to end their partnership with the latter. Founding Golden Harvest Seeds members included Akin Seed, Columbiana Seed, Garwood Seed, Golden Seed, J.C. Robinson Seeds, Sommer Bros. Seed, and Thorp Seed. Akin Seed left the partnership early, while Columbiana Seed was purchased by SeedTec following bankruptcy; the remaining five members continued as Golden Harvest until it ceased to exist as an independent entity. In 2001, J.C. Robinson Seeds, the largest of the five remaining members, was sued by the smaller four. The lawsuit was prompted by J.C. Robinson Seeds' expressed interest in exiting the Golden Harvest association. While the lawsuit was quickly dismissed in favor of J.C. Robinson, J.C. Robinson nevertheless did not leave the relationship. In 2003, J.C. Robinson Seeds purchased a controlling interest in the Dutch company Zelder, adding its corn-related activities to the Golden Harvest group. In 2004, Golden Harvest and Garst were acquired by Syngenta. Golden Harvest and Garst ceased to exist as independent legal entities at the end of 2012,but Syngenta continues to market many of both companies' hybrid corn seed products under the Golden Harvest brand name."

This classical revival style building had been built by David Mitchell for the Equitable Co-operative Society Ltd., and was designed by architects John Grainger and Charles D'Ebro. It was extended through to Little Collins Street, and remodelled in 1887-8 by Albert Purchas. The store's motto was Quod facimus, Valde facimus (What we do, We do well), as the firm had a philosophy of providing exclusive goods and meticulous service. The firm was taken over by Cox Brothers from 1960–66, and then David Jones Ltd. bought the business in 1981."

The company employs some 350 people and at the Bad Hersfeld location continues its predecessor's activities as a supplier of equipment and services for the wood processing and building materials industries as well as the process technology sector. Its offices and workshops were first located in buildings that in part dated back to the old Schilde AG. Beginning in the summer of 2007, engineering and administration were the first departments to move into a new office building located at Gewerbepark Hohe Luft, a business park at the periphery of Bad Hersfeld. Construction of a new factory building right next to the offices began in 2008 and was completed in 2009. Manufacturing and the remaining departments such as R&D and logistics then also moved in from mid-2009. By the end of 2009 all buildings on the former Schilde premises in the town centre were vacated and handed back their owner, the town of Bad Hersfeld."

GCIV now works with the United States Department of State in developing professional and cultural exchange programs for emerging global leaders. The non-partisan citizen diplomacy programs developed by GCIV give Georgians unique opportunities to share best practices and insights, plus form friendships with distinguished visitors, many of whom are seeing the United States for the first time. GCIV administers the U.S. Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) in Georgia. Launched in 1940, the IVLP seeks to build mutual understanding between the United States and other nations through carefully designed professional visits to the U.S. for current and emerging foreign leaders. U.S. ambassadors consistently rank the IVLP as most effective in a long list of public diplomacy tools at their disposal."

Designer Sahil Lavingia founded the company in 2011 with the intention of making selling as easy as social sharing. The company has received more than $8 million in funding. Creators of all types, such as authors, comedians, designers, filmmakers, musicians, and software developers, use Gumroad to sell products directly to consumers, mostly digital content like albums, comics, ebooks, films, games, music, or tutorials. Gumroad is built as a plug-and-play product that offers payment processing, file hosting and delivery, marketing and communications tools, and consumption experiences for a diverse array of verticals. Lavingia has stated that his product philosophy is to ask what creators spend their time on making things, and then build features for Gumroad that do those above-mentioned logistics functions for them. Gumroad’s model is notable for the decentralized nature of its marketplace, placing the product emphasis on the relationship between the creator and consumer, instead of discovery. It is also notable for having a substantially lower fee than other commerce platforms (5% + 25¢)."
