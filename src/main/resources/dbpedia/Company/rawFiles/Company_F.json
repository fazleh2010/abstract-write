  "text" : "Ferrari S.p.A. (pronounced [ferˈrari]) is an Italian sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940. However the company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in 1947, when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed. Ferrari is the world's most powerful brand according to Brand Finance. In May 2012 the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, selling in a private transaction for US$38.1 million to American communications magnate Craig McCaw. Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50 percent of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90 percent in 1988. In October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its intentions to separate Ferrari from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90 percent of Ferrari.The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10 percent of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10 percent continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari. The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016. Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the most successful racing team, holding the most constructors championships (16) and having produced the highest number of winning drivers (15). Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth."

  "text" : "FASA Corporation was an American publisher of role-playing games, wargames and board games between 1980 and 2001, after which they closed publishing operations for several years, becoming an IP holding company under the name FASA Inc. In 2012, a wholly owned subsidiary called FASA Games Inc. went into operation, using the name and logo with permission of the parent company. FASA Games Inc. works alongside Ral Partha Europe, also a subsidiary of FASA Corporation, to bring out new editions of existing properties such as Earthdawn and Demonworld, and to develop new properties within the FASA cosmology. FASA first appeared as a Traveller licensee, producing supplements for that Game Designers' Workshop role-playing game, especially the work of the Keith Brothers. The company went on to establish itself as a major gaming company with the publication of the first licensed Star Trek RPG, then several successful original games. Noteworthy lines included BattleTech and Shadowrun. Their Star Trek role-playing supplements and tactical ship game enjoyed popularity outside the wargaming community since, at the time, official descriptions of the Star Trek universe were not common, and the gaming supplements offered details fans craved. The highly successful BattleTech line led to a series of video games, some of the first virtual reality gaming suites, called Virtual World (created by a subdivision of the company known at the time of development as ESP, an acronym for \"Extremely Secret Project\") and a Saturday-morning animated TV series. Originally the name FASA was an acronym for \"Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration\", a joking allusion to the Marx Brothers film Duck Soup. This tongue-in-cheek attitude was carried over in humorous self-references in its games. For example, in Shadowrun, a tactical nuclear device was detonated near FASA's offices at 1026 W. Van Buren St in Chicago, Illinois."

  "text" : "Fiat S.p.A., or Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino (Italian Automobile Factory of Turin), was an Italian holding company whose original and core activities were in the automotive industry, and that was succeeded by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA). The Fiat Group contained many brands such as Ferrari, Maserati, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, the Chrysler Group, and many more. On 29 January 2014, it was announced that Fiat S.p.A. (the former owner of Fiat Group) was to be merged into a new Netherlands-based holding company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), took place before the end of 2014. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles became the new owner of Fiat Group. On 1 August 2014, Fiat S.p.A. received necessary shareholder approval to proceed with the merger (which followed board approval). The merger became effective 12 October 2014. Fiat was founded in 1899 by a group of investors, including Giovanni Agnelli. During its more than century-long history, Fiat has also manufactured railway engines and carriages, military vehicles, farm tractors, and aircraft. In 2013, Fiat (together with Chrysler) was the second largest European automaker by volumes produced, and the seventh in the world ahead of Honda, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Suzuki, Renault, and Daimler AG. Over the years, Fiat has acquired numerous other automakers: it acquired Lancia in 1968, became a shareholder of Ferrari in 1969, took control of Alfa Romeo from the Italian government in 1986, purchased Maserati in 1993, and became the full owner of Chrysler Group LLC in 2014. Fiat Group currently produces vehicles under twelve brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Ram Trucks, and SRT. In 1970, Fiat employed more than 100,000 in Italy when its production reached the highest number, 1.4 million cars, in that country. As of 2002, Fiat built more than 1 million vehicles at six plants in Italy and the country accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue. Fiat-brand cars are built in several locations around the world. Outside Italy, the largest country of production is Brazil, where the Fiat brand is the market leader. The group also has factories in Argentina, Poland and Mexico (where Fiat-brand vehicles are manufactured at plants owned and operated by Chrysler for export to the U.S., Brazil, Italy and other markets) and a long history of licensing manufacture of its products in other countries. It also has numerous alliances and joint ventures around the world, the main ones being located in Serbia, France, Turkey, India and China. Gianni Agnelli, the grandson of founder Giovanni Agnelli, was Fiat's chairman from 1966 until 1996; he then served as honorary chairman from 1996 until his death on 24 January 2003, during which time Cesare Romiti served as chairman. He was succeeded briefly by Paolo Fresco, who served as chairman, and Paolo Cantarella, as CEO. Umberto Agnelli then took over as chairman from 2003 to 2004. After Umberto Agnelli's death on 28 May 2004, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was named chairman, with Agnelli heir John Elkann becoming vice chairman (at the age of 28), and other family members also serving on the board. On 1 June 2004, Giuseppe Morchio was replaced by Sergio Marchionne as CEO."

  "text" : "Freeview is the United Kingdom's digital terrestrial television platform. It is operated by DTV Services Ltd, a joint venture between the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and transmitter operator Arqiva. It was launched in 2002. The service provides consumer access via an aerial to the six DTT multiplexes covering the United Kingdom. In April 2014 it had some 60 DVB-T TV channels, 26 digital radio channels, 10 HD channels, six text services, 11 streamed channels, and one interactive channel. A number of new HD channels launched in 2014, from a new group of multiplexes awarded to Arqiva. The new HD channels were launched in selected areas on 10 December 2013 with a further roll-out during 2014. DTV Services' delivery of standard-definition television and radio is labelled Freeview, while its delivery of HDTV is called Freeview HD. Reception of Freeview requires a Freeview tuner, either in a separate set-top box or built into the TV set. Since 2008 all new TV sets sold in the United Kingdom have a built-in Freeview tuner. Freeview HD requires a HDTV-capable tuner. Digital video recorders (DVRs) with a built-in Freeview tuner are labelled Freeview+. Depending on model, DVRs and HDTV sets with a Freeview tuner may offer standard Freeview or Freeview HD. The technical specification for Freeview is published and maintained by the Digital TV Group, the industry association for digital TV in the UK which also provide the test and conformance regime for Freeview, Freeview + and Freeview HD products. DMOL (DTT Multiplex Operators Ltd.), a company owned by the operators of the six DTT multiplexes (BBC, ITV, C4, and Arqiva) is responsible for technical platform management and policy, including the electronic programme guide and channel numbering. Since the completion of the digital switch-over on 24 October 2012, there is no terrestrial analogue television being broadcast in the United Kingdom, and all broadcast terrestrial TV is delivered through digital terrestrial television."

It resulted from the fusion of three earlier companies, the 1660 Compagnie de Chine, the Compagnie d'Orient and Compagnie de Madagascar. The first Director General for the Company was De Faye, who was adjoined two Directors belonging to the two most successful trading organizations at that time: François Caron, who had spent 30 years working for the Dutch East India Company, including more than 20 years in Japan, and Marcara Avanchintz, a trader from Ispahan, Persia."

  "text" : "Fleischer Studios, Inc., was an American corporation which originated as an animation studio located at 1600 Broadway, New York City, New York. It was founded in 1921 as Inkwell Studios (Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc.) by brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer who ran the pioneering company from its inception until Paramount Pictures, the studio's parent company and the distributor of its films, acquired ownership. In its prime, The Fleischer Studio was a premier producer of animated cartoons for theaters, with Walt Disney Productions's becoming its chief competitor in the 1930s. Fleischer Studios is notable for Koko the Clown, Betty Boop, Bimbo, Popeye the Sailor, and Superman. Unlike other studios, whose characters were anthropomorphic animals, the Fleischers' most successful characters were humans. The cartoons of the Fleischer Studio were very different from the Disney product, both in concept and in execution. As a result, the Fleischer cartoons were rough rather than refined, commercial rather than consciously artistic. But in their unique way, their artistry was expressed through a culmination of the arts and sciences. The approach was sophisticated, focused on surrealism, dark humor, adult psychological elements, and sexuality. And the environments were grittier and urban, often set in squalid surroundings—a reflection of the Depression as well as German Expressionism."

  "text" : "The Fraunhofer Society (German: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e. V. — “Fraunhofer Society for the advancement of applied research”, pronounced [ˈfraʊnhoːfɐ]) is a German research organization with 67 institutes spread throughout Germany, each focusing on different fields of applied science (as opposed to the Max Planck Society, which works primarily on basic science). It employs around 24,000 people, mainly scientists and engineers, with an annual research budget of about €2.1 billion. Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state (the German public, through the federal government together with the states or Länder, “owns” the Fraunhofer Society), but more than 70% of the funding is earned through contract work, either for government-sponsored projects or from industry. It is named after Joseph von Fraunhofer who, as a scientist, an engineer, and an entrepreneur, is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the society. The organization has seven centers in the United States, under the name “Fraunhofer USA”, and three in Asia. In October 2010, Fraunhofer announced that it would open its first research center in South America.Fraunhofer UK Research Ltd was established along with the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics, in Glasgow, Scotland, in March 2012."

Run by Flytoget AS (formerly NSB Gardermobanen AS), it operates on the high-speed Gardermoen Line using sixteen GMB Class 71 electric trains. Normal service frequency is once every ten minutes, with four of the services each hour continuing westwards beyond Oslo Central. The extended services serve nine stops within Greater Oslo and take up to 60 minutes. Flytoget transported 5.4 million passengers in 2007, a 34-percent market share of airport ground transport. The service, which has a top speed of 210 kilometres per hour (130 mph), is the only high-speed rail service in Norway. Construction started in 1994 and high-speed trains began serving Gardermoen Airport from the date of its opening on 8 October 1998, although full operation using the 14.5-kilometre-long (9.0 mi) Romerike Tunnel had to wait another ten and a half months after severe leaks caused by the tunnel's construction led to the partial depletion of two lakes. Formed in 1992 as a subsidiary of Norwegian State Railways, the company has been owned since 2001 by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry."

Franklin Manufacturing Company in 1893 and, in 1901, teamed up with engineer John Wilkinson to develop an air-cooled engine. In 1902, the Franklin automobile was introduced. Because he was the primary investor, Franklin assumed control of the company, and named the auto manufacturing division Franklin Automobile Company. As president, he managed the company finances and business administration. Wilkinson was named chief engineer and granted control of the engineering and manufacturing operation. Throughout its history, Franklin was a luxury brand and competed with other upscale automobiles of the day. As such, it fell victim to the Great Depression along with many luxury car manufacturers. The company sold about 150,000 cars over the course of more than 30 years in existence."

In November 2001, Future Shop was acquired by the American consumer electronics store chain Best Buy for $580 million. Although Best Buy began to establish Canadian locations under its own name following the purchase, it continued to operate the Future Shop stores as a separate chain, even though many of the new locations were in close proximity to existing Future Shop stores. On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the discontinuation of Future Shop and the closure of 66 of its locations. The remaining stores were consolidated into the Best Buy chain, as the company began the process of converting them to their name and store format."

  "text" : "Funimation (sometimes stylized as FUNimation) is an American entertainment and anime and foreign licensing company based in Flower Mound, Texas. The studio is one of the leading distributors of anime and other foreign entertainment properties in North America alongside Viz Media, Sentai Filmworks and Aniplex of America. Their most popular property is Toei Animation's action-adventure series Dragon Ball Z, which had a successful run on Cartoon Network's Toonami block from 1998 to 2003, and has been re-released on DVD and Blu-ray several times since. It was founded on May 9, 1994 by Gen Fukunaga and his wife Cindy as Funimation Productions, with funding by Daniel Cocanougher and his family, who became investors in the company. Funimation was sold to Navarre Corporation on May 11, 2005 and the company was renamed Funimation Entertainment. In April 2011, Navarre sold Funimation to a group of investors including Fukunaga for $24 million. Around the same time, the company's trademark ball, star and blue bar were dropped from its logo and the company was renamed to simply Funimation. In May 2013, Funimation consolidated its divisions under its new holding company Group 1200 Media. Funimation is a portmanteau of the English words \"fun\" and \"animation\"."

  "text" : "Friendster was a social gaming site based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was originally a social networking service website. Before Friendster was redesigned, the service allowed users to contact other members, maintain those contacts, and share online content and media with those contacts. The website was also used for dating and discovering new events, bands and hobbies. Users could share videos, photos, messages and comments with other members via profiles and networks. It is considered one of the original and even the \"grandfather\" of social networks. After the relaunch of Friendster as a social gaming platform in June 2011, the number of registered users reached over 115 million. The company operated mainly from three Asian countries: the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, and over 90% of the site's traffic came from Asia. As of 2008, Friendster had more monthly unique visitors than any other social network in Asia. The top 10 countries accessing Friendster, according to Alexa, as of May 7, 2009 were the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, South Korea, Bangladesh and India. Friendster remained notably popular in Indonesia through 2012. On June 14, 2015 Friendster, citing \"the evolving landscape in our challenging industry\" and lack of engagement by the online community, suspended their services."

  "text" : "The Fleer Corporation, founded by Frank H. Fleer in 1885, was the first company to successfully manufacture bubblegum; it remained a family-owned enterprise until 1989. Fleer originally developed a bubblegum formulation called Blibber-Blubber in 1906. However, while this gum was capable of being blown into bubbles, in other respects it was vastly inferior to regular chewing gum, and Blibber-Blubber was never marketed to the public. In 1928, Fleer employee Walter Diemer improved the Blibber-Blubber formulation to produce the first commercially successful bubblegum, Dubble Bubble. Its pink color set a tradition for nearly all bubble gums to follow. Fleer became known as a maker of sports cards, and has also produced some non-sports trading cards. In 1995, Fleer acquired the trading card company SkyBox International and, over Thanksgiving vacation shuttered its Philadelphia plant (where Dubble Bubble was made for 67 years). In 1998, 70-year-old Dubble Bubble was acquired by Canadian company Concord Confections; Concord, in turn, was acquired by Chicago-based Tootsie Roll Industries in 2004. In late May 2005, news circulated that Fleer was suspending its trading card operations immediately. By early July, in a move similar to declaring bankruptcy, the company began to liquidate its assets to repay creditors. The move included the auction of the Fleer trade name, as well as other holdings. Competitor Upper Deck won the Fleer name, as well as their die cast toy business, at a price of $6.1 million. Just one year earlier, Upper Deck tendered an offer of $25 million, which was rejected by Fleer based on the hope that the sports card market would turn in a direction more favorable to their licenses and target collector demographic. One negative aspect associated with Fleer's Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors is that many sports card collectors now own redemption cards for autographs and memorabilia that may not be able to be redeemed; those fears were somewhat quenched in early 2006 when random memorabilia cards were mailed to the aforementioned collectors."

Fox Searchlight's Slumdog Millionaire, 12 Years a Slave, and Birdman have all won the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 81st Academy Awards, 86th Academy Awards, and 87th Academy Awards respectively, as well as a further 12 Academy Awards combined. Other Fox Searchlight films receiving Best Picture nominations include The Full Monty, Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, Black Swan, 127 Hours, The Tree of Life, The Descendants, Beasts of the Southern Wild, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Brooklyn. Slumdog Millionaire is also Searchlight's largest commercial success, with over $377 million (US) of box office receipts, against a production budget of only $15 million."

  "text" : "FWD (originally Free World Dialup) was a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network and business venture owned by Pulver.com, Inc. and founded in 1994 by Jeff Pulver, Brandon Lucas, and Izak Jenie. It appears to have ceased operations in 2010 The service provided voice communications between its subscribers worldwide, based on Internet standards. Limited inter-connections to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) provided users the ability to receive direct-dialed calls from PSTN-landline users, as well as place calls to toll-free numbers in the United States and other countries. Pursuant to a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on February 12, 2004, the Wireline Competition Bureau considered FWD to be an information service rather than a telecommunications service. This ruling followed a petition by Pulver.com on February 5, 2003 seeking a declaration of this nature. A similar petition by AT&T remains under consideration. On September 27, 2005, the company changed its name from Free World Dialup to FWD. A servicemark for the new name was granted on April 20, 2004. According to the registration record, the servicemark was not an acronym: the letters stood for nothing at all. FWD was connected to other VoIP networks by IPeerX, a VoIP peering company which spun off from FWD. Pulver sold IPeerX to Xconnect in 2006;. By 2009, Free World Dialup had closed open enrollment of new members \"to focus on HD content and services\"."

  "text" : "FOREX Bank is a Swedish financial services company specialising in currency exchange services. The company was started in 1927 providing services for travellers, at the Central Station in Stockholm. The owner of Gyllenspet's Barber Shop, according to the legend, discovered that most of his customers were tourists in need of currency for their trips. The owner began keeping the major currencies on hand. The company was subsequently acquired by Statens Järnvägar, the Swedish State Railways, which expanded the operations until it was sold to Rolf Friberg in 1965. The company was for many years the only one apart from the banks that was licensed to conduct currency exchange in Sweden. The company, which is still wholly owned by the Friberg family, has expanded into Finland (1993), Denmark (1994) and Norway (2004) and has 130 shops, located at railway stations or airports, shopping malls and other hubs. In 2003, the company extended its business into banking and can also offer current and savings accounts incl internet and mobile banking, loans, debit and credit cards, cash handling, money transfer and payments."

Flagship Studios was formed following the resignation en masse of Blizzard North management following a dispute with Blizzard Entertainment parent company Vivendi regarding the potential fate of the company, development team, and titles, which were in doubt at that time. Flagship Studio's primary target platform for their games was the PC. Flagship Studios had a partnership with Namco Hometek and HanbitSoft to cover an international market for game marketing and distribution.

  "text" : "The Fox Entertainment Group is an American entertainment company that operates through four segments, mainly filmed entertainment, television stations, television broadcast networks, and cable network programming. The company is wholly owned and controlled by the American media conglomerate 21st Century Fox, which is owned and chaired by Rupert Murdoch, since the company acquired all the stock of Fox. The transaction was completed on March 12, 2005. The division was part of the renamed 21st Century Fox after it had spun off its publishing divisions into the newly formed \"New\" News Corporation in 2013 as part of a corporate re-organization. It is named after William Fox, born Wilhelm Fuchs, who created the original Fox Film Corporation. Jim Gianopulos is currently the chairman of Fox Entertainment Group, a position he shared with Tom Rothman until 2012."

It was founded in 1946 in Alba, Piedmont, Italy by Pietro Ferrero, a confectioner and small-time pastry maker who laid the groundwork for the Nutella and famously added hazelnut to save money on chocolate. The company saw a period of tremendous growth and success under Pietro's son Michele Ferrero, who in turn handed over the daily operations to his sons. His son Pietro (the founder's grandson), who oversaw global business, died on April 18, 2011, in a cycling accident in South Africa at the age of 47. Reputation Institute's 2009 survey ranks Ferrero as the most reputable company in the world. Ferrero SpA is a private company owned by the Ferrero family and has been described as \"one of the world's most secretive firms\". The Ferrero Group worldwide – now headed by CEO Giovanni Ferrero – includes 38 trading companies, 18 factories, approximately 21,500 employees and produces around 365,000 tonnes of Nutella each year. Ferrero International SA's headquarters is in Luxembourg. Its German factory is the largest of all and Pasquale Giorgio is its current CEO."

  "text" : "Fawcett Comics, a division of Fawcett Publications, was one of several successful comic book publishers during the Golden Age of Comic Books in the 1940s. Its most popular character was Captain Marvel, the alter ego of radio reporter Billy Batson, who transformed into the hero whenever he said the magic word \"Shazam!\". Other characters published by Fawcett include Captain Video, Hopalong Cassidy, Ibis the Invincible, Bulletman and Bulletgirl, Spy Smasher, Captain Midnight, Phantom Eagle, Mister Scarlet and Pinky, Minute-Man, Commando Yank and Golden Arrow. Aside from the better known superhero books, Fawcett also published a short-lived line of horror comics during the early 1950s, a string of titles which included This Magazine Is Haunted, Beware! Terror Tales, Worlds of Fear, Strange Suspense Stories, and Unknown World. Other genres included teenage humor (Otis and Babs), funny animal (Hoppy the Marvel Bunny), romance (Sweethearts), war (Soldier Comics) and Western (Lash LaRue, Six Gun Heroes). Fawcett also produced comics based on contemporary movie stars (Tom Mix, Monte Hale) and matinee serials (Nyoka the Jungle Girl). The entire line was dropped in 1953, when Fawcett closed down their comics publishing wing (though many titles were picked up by Charlton Comics [see below])."

  "text" : "F. B. Rogers Silver Co. was a silversmithing company founded in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts in 1883. It was acquired by Edmund W. Porter and L.B. West, who incorporated the company and moved manufacturing operations to Taunton, Massachusetts in 1886. For several years, the company became known as West Silver Company, and was producing silver products for the William Rogers Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. About 1904, West and Porter retired and sold the company to William Davison, Carleton A. Woodward and H.E. Nearing, who changed the company's name back to F.B. Rogers. In 1925 the company moved from 31 Winthrop Street to 59 Wales Street. In 1943 it moved to West Water Street, to a site formerly occupied by the Weir Stove Company, who produced Glenwood Ranges. In 1955, it became a division of the National Silver Company. The company used many different marks over the years. One of them is a crown with the number 18 at the left and 83 at the right (for 1883). In 2009 the 414 West Water Street property was demolished by Costello Dismantling."

  "text" : "Frigidaire is the American consumer and commercial home appliances brand subsidiary of European parent company Electrolux. Frigidaire was founded as the Guardian Frigerator Company in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and developed the first self-contained refrigerator (invented by Nathaniel B. Wales and Alfred Mellowes) in 1916. In 1918, William C. Durant, a founder of General Motors, personally invested in the company and in 1919, it adopted the name Frigidaire. The brand was so well known in the refrigeration field in the early-to-mid-1900s that many Americans called any refrigerator (of whatever brand) a Frigidaire. The name Frigidaire or its antecedent Frigerator may be the origin of the widely used English word fridge, although more likely simply an abbreviation of refrigerator which is a word known to have been used as early as 1611. From 1919 to 1979, the company was owned by General Motors. During that period, it was first a subsidiary of Delco-Light and was later an independent division based in Dayton, Ohio. Frigidaire was sold to the White Sewing Machine Company in 1979, which in 1986 was purchased by Electrolux, its current parent. While the company was owned by General Motors, its logo featured the phrase \"Product of General Motors\", and later renamed to \"Home Environment Division of General Motors\". The company claims firsts including: \n*  Electric self-contained refrigerator (September, 1918 in Detroit) \n*  Home food freezer \n*  Room air conditioner \n*  30\" electric range \n*  Coordinated colors for home appliances"

In order to have a stronger relationship with Factor 5's North American partners like LucasArts, Factor 5, Inc. was established in the US in May 1996 with legal support from LucasArts, and in late 1996 the core of the development team in Germany was relocated to the North American company headquarters in San Rafael, California. Julian Eggebrecht, one of the five initial co-founders, served as President of Factor 5's US branch. The US company closed in May 2009, following the closure of Brash Entertainment, with which the company had multiple contracts. The original German company, headed by CEO Achim Moller, remained active due to its unrelated business policy and operations with the North American company. However, in January 2011, Moller liquidated Factor 5 GmbH, and all game licenses were transferred to \"Eggebrecht, Engel, Schmidt GbR\"."

  "text" : "Fore River Shipyard was a shipyard owned by General Dynamics Corporation located on Weymouth Fore River in Braintree and Quincy, Massachusetts. It began operations in 1883 in Braintree, and moved to its final location on Quincy Point in 1901. In 1913, it was purchased by Bethlehem Steel, and later transferred to Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. It was sold to General Dynamics in 1963, and closed in 1986. During its operation, yardworkers constructed hundreds of ships, for both military and civilian clients. Most of the ships at the yard were built for the United States Navy, with its first government contract for the destroyer USS Lawrence (DD-8). The yard also built early submarines for Electric Boat, including USS Octopus (SS-9) and USS Sunfish (SSN-649). Fore River also constructed the battleship USS Massachusetts (BB-59), and the cruisers USS Springfield (CL-66) and USS Salem (CA-139) as well as the Navy's first carrier USS Lexington (CV-2) and its successor USS Lexington (CV-16). Fore River produced multiple foreign ships for various navies around the world including five Type 1 submarines for the Imperial Japanese Navy, ten submarines for the Royal Navy, and the battleship ARA Rivadavia, for the Argentine Navy. The yard also constructed several merchant marine ships, including the Thomas W. Lawson, the largest pure sailing ship ever built, and SS Marine Dow-Chem, which was the first ship constructed to carry refrigerated chemicals. General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, as it eventually came to be known, ended its career as a producer of various LNG tankers and merchant marine ships. According to one theory, the yard was the origin of the \"Kilroy was here\" pop culture reference, and was home to the second-largest shipbuilding crane in the world. During the period in which it was operable, the yard had two sub-yards: the first was the Victory Destroyer Plant in Quincy during World War I, and the second was the Bethlehem Hingham Shipyard in Hingham during World War II. In addition, the yard owned Bethlehem Atlantic Works, a drydock facility which was located in East Boston."

The main competitors were B&Q, Homebase and Wickes. The company operated 178 stores in the United Kingdom with 3000 employees, but had been running losses every year since 2007. In the year up to 2011, the company had a loss of £25 million. On 4 May 2011, the Focus Group announced that it was going to enter administration; the following group companies went into administration: Focus (DIY) Limited, Focus (Investments) Limited, Payless DIY Limited, Payless Properties Limited, Do It All Limited and Do It All (Holdings) Limited. The company entered administration on 5 May 2011, with Ernst & Young appointed as administrators. As no buyer was found for the chain as a whole, the company was put into a wind-down process. During this period the administrators sold 55 stores to B&Q, Wickes and B&M Bargains. The remaining 123 stores were closed, in intervals, beginning on 19 June 2011, until the final closures on 22 July 2011."

  "text" : "Filofax is a company based in the UK that produces a range of well-known personal organiser wallets. The organisers are traditionally leather bound and have a six-ring loose-leaf binder system. The design originated at Lefax, a United States company based in Philadelphia who exported products into the UK. The company also markets a range of personal leather goods and luggage under the \"Filofax\" brand. These organisers are available in over fifteen countries in the following sizes: A4, A5, Slimline, Personal, Pocket, Mini, Compact and Pocket Slimline. The name originates from an abbreviation of the phrase \"file of facts\". This name for the product was first coined when the UK company was founded in 1921. The popularity of the Filofax personal organiser grew enormously during the early 1980s due to its association with Yuppie Culture, where it was regarded as a \"must-have\" accessory, in the days before electronic organisers. The company was known as Norman & Hill until the mid-1980s when it renamed itself after its most popular product. For much of its life it was based in South Woodford, East London. In the early 1980s it moved to Barkingside, Essex. It was bought by David Collischon. In the early 1990s it moved its offices back to London and subcontracted its warehouse operation to Crick in Northamptonshire. Famous devotees of the Filofax products include Lord Lichfield and Len Deighton. Filofax is part of the UK-based Letts Group. In 2006, Phoenix Equity Partners led a secondary buy out of the business. The deal provided an exit for private equity firm Dunedin Capital Partners. In 2012 the company was acquired by HSGP Investments."

  "text" : "Flying Fish Brewing Company is a small craft beer brewer founded in Cherry Hill, New Jersey (approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia) in 1995 and opened for business in late 1996. It was founded by Gene Muller and first launched on the World Wide Web, allowing beer lovers to participate in selecting and naming the types of beers the brewery would produce, volunteer as taste-testers, or even to sign up to be a brewer. Having tripled their capacity since 1996, Flying Fish is now the largest of the craft brewers in New Jersey. The four year-round styles [Belgian Abbey Dubbel, HopFish IPA, ESB (Extra Special Bitter) Ale, and XPA (Extra Pale Ale)] are supplemented by a variety of seasonals, some only rarely available. In 2012 Flying Fish moved to a larger facility in nearby Somerdale, New Jersey."

Today, it employs over ten thousand people in Finland as well as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Baltic countries, the United Kingdom and Russia. Fazer's production is divided into four major areas: \n*  Fazer Amica, a chain of work-place restaurants \n*  Fazer bakeries, producing various kinds of bread \n*  Candyking, shop-in shop pick 'n' mix confectionery concept \n*  Fazer Café, a chain of cafés. The main Fazer café is on Kluuvikatu in Helsinki. Particularly Fazer's classic chocolate (Fazerin Sininen maitosuklaa) is famous in Finland, and the blue colour of its wrapper has been used by Fazer as a symbol for the whole product line. Fazer has bought a few other companies, including Finnish Chymos and Danish Perelly. The confectionery line was merged with its Swedish competitor Cloetta in 2000, to become Cloetta Fazer, though the merger lasted only until 2008 before the two brands were separated back to independent companies. Later, Fazer Keksit (which made biscuits) was sold to Danone. It was renamed to LU Suomi."

The company was one of the pioneers of one-stop shopping, eventually combining a complete grocery supermarket with a drugstore, clothing store, shoe store, fine jewelers, home decor store, home improvement center, garden center, electronics store, toy store, sporting goods store, and more under one roof. Fred Meyer stores are located in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska. Before the company's merger with Kroger in October 1998, it traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FMY. Although the company is now an entity of Kroger, the stores are still branded Fred Meyer, and the western region of The Kroger Company is headquartered in Portland. Fred Meyer is sometimes known as \"Freddy's\", a nickname the company was given by its customers and which is used in its advertising. For a number of years, the company has used the marketing slogan What's on your list today? You'll find it at Fred Meyer! or, more simply, What's on your list today? in its advertising."

  "text" : "Fox Animation Studios was an American animation production company located in Phoenix, Arizona. It was a division of 20th Century Fox Animation. After the financially unsuccessful release of Sullivan Bluth Studios' film Thumbelina in 1994, animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were hired by Bill Mechanic, then-chairman of 20th Century Fox, to be the creative heads of the animation studio. Mechanic and John Matoian, President of Fox Family Films, also brought in Stephen Brain (Executive VP at Silver Pictures) as Senior VP/General Manager to oversee the startup of the studio and run day-to-day operations of the division. The studio closed in 2000, after the financial failure of their third film, Titan A.E.."

It is probably best remembered as the production company of CBS’ “rural comedies” of the 1960s, including Mister Ed, The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres, as well as the comedy-drama The Trials of O'Brien, the western Dundee and the Culhane, the adventure show Bearcats!, the police drama Cagney & Lacey, and The Addams Family. Notable films the company produced include The Sandpiper, The Cincinnati Kid, The Fearless Vampire Killers, Ice Station Zebra, Summer Lovers, The Burning, King and Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill and Blow Out. Filmways acquired famous companies throughout the years, such as Heatter-Quigley Productions, Ruby-Spears Productions and American International Pictures.

  "text" : "Food Basics is a discount Canadian supermarket chain owned by Metro Inc. The company operates over 115 stores throughout Ontario. Food Basics was created by A&P Canada to compete with the successful No Frills warehouse-style supermarket operated by Loblaw Companies. It became part of the Metro group when A&P Canada was sold to Metro in 2005. Food Basics lowers its prices in a number of ways: low maintenance (no free plastic bags, just free cardboard boxes), store decor is kept to a minimum and fewer staff are employed, mostly in part-time positions. The chain operates by pushing higher volumes on a limited selection of products than Metro stores allowing it to compete price-wise with other grocery stores. There are 117 locations in Ontario. 36 were franchise stores until Metro Inc. purchased all stores back by the end of 2008. Some Food Basics feature a pharmacy, and are known as Food & Drug Basics. Some locations are former Super Fresh or A&P supermarkets, dating from when both chains were operated by A&P, or formerly bore banners such as A&P-owned Dominion (supermarket) or Métro-owned Super C. In the past, the owners' names appeared on the banner (e.g., 'John/Jane's Food Basics'); however, all stores are now simply called 'Food Basics'. Concurrent with this change is a different slogan, which was changed from \"Best Prices Everyday!!!\" to \"Always more for less!\" In Fall 2006, Metro Inc. began to renovate Food Basics stores. The design and format of these new stores closely resemble Metro's Super C banner in Quebec. New store signs feature broken lettering and a larger emphasis on yellow, green and beige colours. In Spring 2007, Metro Inc. initiated their new BDMS inventory system into all of its warehouses."

  "text" : "Freedom Yachts was the maker of the Freedom (sail) and Legacy (power) yacht brands. The Freedom sailboats have unstayed rigs, meaning that the mast is freestanding and not supported by the normal set of wires called standing rigging. Garry Hoyt, a champion sailor and noted maverick, created the unstayed rigs to give \"freedom\" from the inefficient sail shapes of traditional sloop rigs as well as to give \"freedom\" from the compression and maintenance issues associated with standing rigging. A known issue with this style of mast, however, is that in rough seas it can break loose, causing a potential holing (pounds through the bottom of the hull). This is commonly due to the tangs that hold it in place failing. The masts are made of carbon fiber and are set well forward on the boat. This means most of the sail area is contained in the mainsail. Jib sails can either be overlapping or self-tending. Gary Hoyt founded Freedom Yachts in 1976 with the Freedom 40. He sold Freedom Yachts to Tillotson-Pearson in 1985 after some slow years. He used naval architects from the Herreshoff design offices for his early designs and in the early '80s commissioned a 39 feet pilothouse design from Ron Holland. Tillotson-Pearson brought Gary Mull on board as designer for a new series of great sailing but awfully conventional looking boats. David Pedrick designed for the (again) new owners starting in the mid 90's after Tillotson-Pearson Composites sold the yacht division off."

Jay Call and headquartered in Ogden, Utah. A lifelong fan of aviation, Call named it Flying J in honor of the aviation industry. It sought Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy protection in December 2008, blaming its financial woes on the collapse in oil prices and tighter credit markets. Pre-bankruptcy, Flying J was the largest retailer of diesel fuel in North America with approximately 220 locations in the United States and Canada and 15,000 employees. The company produces and refines petroleum products for its truck stops. The company also offers vehicle maintenance, banking, insurance and telecommunications services for the trucking industry, and a number of restaurants at its locations. The company had sales of $18.0 billion in 2008, but record prices for crude oil and a crumbling demand for gasoline eroded margins and affected cash flow. The company ranked 13th on Forbes' 2009 list of the largest privately held companies in the U.S.with 2008 revenues of approximately $18.00 billion. Flying J is cited by the Terror-Free Oil Initiative as a company that does not purchase oil from terrorism-sponsoring nations. The company's plans for travel plazas have occasionally met opposition from local residents concerned about traffic safety and other issues. In 2006 Flying J associated with Shell Canada to improve highway services in Canada."

  "text" : "Fastline was created by six railwaymen who undertook a successful management buyout (MBO) of Eastern Track Renewals from British Rail in 1996. In that year they bought Northern Track Renewals from British Rail, and undertook all the studies and examinations that resulted in their acquiring a Harsco Track Renewals Train, the first continuous-process track relaying system in the country. They also examined the possibility of acquiring their own diesel locomotives because of dissatisfaction with the service provided by others for engineering trains. The company was acquired by Jarvis, who later resurrected the Fastline name to create a railway freight operator. It operated a fleet of Class 56 and Class 66 locomotives. The class 56s cost £700,000 each to refurbish. A fourth and a fifth Class 56 (56311 & 56312) were hired in from Hanson Traction Ltd. Fastline's base was at Doncaster, Yorkshire. It ceased trading when Jarvis plc entered administration and subsequently ceased trading in late March 2010. The company is in administration with N.G. Edwards, N.B. Kahn, P.S. Bowers and I. Brown of Deloitte LLP."

  "text" : "Fortunoff was a New York-based retailer of home, jewelry and furniture stores founded in 1922 by Max and Clara Fortunoff. The original Fortunoff store was on Livonia Avenue in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York. The chain's flagship store was in Westbury, Long Island; the store opened in 1964 and anchored The Mall at the Source, which was built around the Fortunoff store, from 1997 until Fortunoff's closing in 2009. Fortunoff had four full-line stores in the chain. In addition to the Westbury flagship, these stores were located in White Plains, New York, Woodbridge, New Jersey, and Wayne, New Jersey. In addition, Fortunoff operated 16 specialty stores: Jewelry and fine gifts were offered at the chain's shops on 57th Street in Manhattan, which closed in February 2009, and were also offered at Fortunoff's Paramus Park Mall location. A clearance center was also operated in East Garden City, New York. Indoor and outdoor furniture were the focus of another 14 stores throughout New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania; these stores were known as \"Fortunoff Backyard Stores\". This portion of the Fortunoff chain was revived in February 2010, although not all former Fortunoff Backyard Stores have reopened. The chain began liquidating all of its stores on February 25, 2009; the sales concluded a little more than three months later in the first week of June 2009. In July 2009, following company dissolution, the descendants of Max and Clara Fortunoff reacquired the intellectual property and website. Fortunoff now does business as an online jewelry retailer, as well as operating its Backyard Stores."

  "text" : "Frederick Brewing Company (at one point also known as Wild Goose Brewery) is a brewery at the Wedgewood Business Park in Frederick, Maryland, United States. It was founded sometime between 1992 and 1993 by Marjorie McGinnis, Kevin Brannon, and Steve Nordahl and had its grand opening on 12 February 1997. The company was taken over by Snyder International Brewing Group in 1999 and merged with Snyder International Brewing Group in 2001. In early 2002 or 2003 the company was placed into receivership and in 2006 was purchased by Flying Dog Brewery and renamed Wild Goose Brewery. At some point the brewery stopped being known as Wild Goose Brewery and just became Flying Dog Brewery. The brewery was generally considered to be state of the art. The plant cost somewhere between $4.4 million and $8 million to build, with $4.5 million of the cost being paid for with economic development bonds, and in 2002 it had a capacity of 80,000 barrels annually. The company though was never able to sell more than 11,000 barrels of its brand Blue Ridge in any given year. When the company's stock was initially issued in 1995 it sold for over $6 a share and was traded on NASDAQ, but by 2002 it sold for less than 10 cents. Frederick Brewing Company is considered to exemplify the 1990s microbeer bubble. Modern Brewery Age calls Frederick Brewing Company \"the exemplar of heedless expansion of the micro segment\". According to K. Timothy Swanson, there was a microbrew craze in the 1990s that ended with consumers being confused by the vast number of beers available. When the microbrewing industry declined, Frederick Brewing Company went with it."

  "text" : "Fluor Corporation is a multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and lists 136th overall in the same rankings. Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries. In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System."

  "text" : "Fran's Restaurant is a small chain of restaurants based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Its first restaurant was a haunt of pianist Glenn Gould. The flagship location was opened in 1940 by G. Francis \"Fran\" Deck at 21 St Clair Avenue West and closed in 2001. Fran's, originally beginning as a diner, had only ten seats, but later expanded to a small chain of restaurants in Toronto, including locations at 2275 Yonge and Eglinton, (1945-2001) 1386 Bathurst south of Vaughan Road, Yonge and College (1950–present), Yonge and Dundas (1960-1984) and one in Hamilton with their head office being on Mt Pleasant Road north of Merton Street. Currently, Fran's operates five corporate-owned locations, including four in Toronto, and one in Barrie, Ontario. Fran Deck died in 1976 in a car accident in Tucson, Arizona; the business was continued by his family. In the 1990s, the family-owned chain was sold to a group of investors who intended to expand the chain throughout the Greater Toronto Area. In 1997, the College St. location was purchased by an independent restaurateur, Joon Kim. The College St. location retained the Fran's menu and restaurant name. In 1998, the Fran's Restaurant company was purchased by the owner of the College St. location. Once again, Fran's Restaurant became a family-owned and operated restaurant and is today owned by Joon Kim and his sons. Because of the proximity of the College St. location to Maple Leaf Gardens, many of its clients were hockey fans catching a meal before or after a Maple Leafs hockey game. Moreover, many of its long-time customers continued to frequent the location. In 2004, as a part of a gradual expansion program, a new location was opened in the Pantages Hotels and Suites at Victoria and Shuter. With the opening, Fran's modified its menu to include new food items alongside its traditional favourites by doubling the food choice. Following the opening of the Victoria and Shuter location, Fran's expanded to Barrie, Ontario, opening a restaurant on Bayfield Street in December 2006. This location became the first location that is not open 24 hours a day. Closed 2015. In 2009 Fran's Restaurants opened its first corporate United States location in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, in the Power & Light Entertainment District. In August 2010, Fran's opened its third Toronto-based location near the intersection of Yonge and Front Streets, across from the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts. Along with its modern decor, it also the first Fran's Restaurant to have a full-service bar in its substantial outdoor patio. This location is the first to expand its brand from a diner concept to a restaurant and bar and includes a full size outdoor bar and patio with both patio table and lounge chair configurations. Fran's Restaurant is the originator of the term \"Banquet Burger\". Fran's was a constant haunt of pianist Glenn Gould. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation profile of Gould notes: \"Sometime between two and three every morning Gould would go to Fran's, a 24-hour diner a block away from his Toronto apartment, sit in the same booth and order the same meal of scrambled eggs.\" In 2014, Fran's opened a booth at the Canadian National Exhibition's Food Building for the first time and will feature exclusive fare developed especially for the fair such as pie shakes, peanut butter-Sriracha balls, a Thanksgiving waffle and a Big Breakfast Maple Toast Box."

  "text" : "Fox Sports Australia Pty Limited (formerly Premier Media Group Pty Limited) is a subsidiary of News Corp Australia that owns sports-related television networks and digital properties. It owns Australian subscription TV channels Fox Sports, Fox Sports News and Fox Footy and a range of video, text and statistical content for television, mobile phone and online delivery. In February 2012, Premier Media Group changed its name to Fox Sports, with CEO Patrick Delany explaining “The change from Premier Media to Fox Sports provides a stronger reflection of the core business of the company in its name, which is, and will continue to be, sport.\" Fox Sports broadcasts an average of around 20 hours of live sport per day into 2.5 million homes around Australia on subscription television with six million potential viewers through Foxtel and Optus TV. The Fox Sports channels are also available in more than 5,100 hotels and licensed venues as well as 180,000 hotel rooms throughout Australia. Fox Sports currently has broadcast rights for the AFL, NRL, A-League, Socceroos, English Premier League, Super Rugby, Wallaby tests, domestic and international cricket, Golf Majors, Tennis Grand Slams, Basketball and Motorsport. On 2 November 2012, News Corp. took control of Consolidated Media Holdings after a $2 billion merger was approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Federal Court and Consolidated Media Holding shareholders, making News Corp. 100% owner of Fox Sports Pty Ltd."

  "text" : "Four Star Television, also called Four Star International, was an American television production company. The company was founded in 1952 as Four Star Productions, by prominent Hollywood actors Dick Powell, David Niven, Joel McCrea, and Charles Boyer. McCrea left the company soon after, and was replaced with Ida Lupino as the fourth star, even though she did not own any stock in the company. Four Star produced many well-known shows of the early days of television, including Four Star Playhouse (their first series), Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, Stagecoach West, The June Allyson Show (aka The DuPont Show Starring June Allyson), The Dick Powell Show, Burke's Law, The Rogues and The Big Valley. Despite each of its four stars sharing equal billing, it was Powell who played the biggest role in the success of the company's growth. Within a few years of Four Star's formation, Powell became President of the company. In 1955, a second company, Four Star Films, Inc., was formed as an affiliate organization to produce shows as The Rifleman, Trackdown, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Richard Diamond, Private Detective and The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor. There were also failed series, like Jeannie Carson's Hey, Jeannie!. In the late winter of 1958, both Four Star Productions and Four Star Films were merged into the new holding company Four Star Television, and began publicly trading on the American Stock Exchange on January 12, 1959. The company changed hands a few times before it was acquired by New World Entertainment in 1989."

  "text" : "Fermentek Ltd. is a biotechnological company in the Atarot industrial zone of Jerusalem, Israel. It specializes in the research, development and manufacture of biologically active, natural products isolated from microorganisms as well as from other natural sources such as plants and algae. The main microorganisms used are nonpathogenic actinomycetes, Nocardia and Streptomycetes. The fungi used are: Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and the like. None of these is a human pathogen. Fermentek does not sell to individuals. Most of its products are marketed through major international distributors specializing in chemicals, under their own brand names. Nevertheless, Fermentek has specific impact on the biochemical market, especially in the field of mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds produced by molds in human food and farm animal feeds, thus being economically important factors. Fermentek manufactures an extensive line of pure mycotoxins used as standards in food analysis. In some cases, such as Aflatoxin M2, Fermentek supplies the entire world's requirements. In 2009 Fermentek announced a product family of highly standardized calibrant solutions of main mycotoxins. These are marketed under the brand name FermaSol. In 2010 it obtained ISO 13485 accreditation in connection with the production of starting materials for experimental drug production, and with manufacturing of reference standards of food contaminants. None of Fermentek's products have been invented by it. Fermentek's aim is to make known compounds affordable to the scientific community. Fermentek was founded by Dr Yosef Behrend in 1994. It moved in 2004 to its new building, quadrupling its working space and greatly enlarging its manufacturing capacities."

The company's productions include the animated series Family Guy, American Dad! and the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, as well as the live-action sitcom The Winner and the science documentary series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. The name of the company comes from the leopard-printed fake fur-covered door to the house MacFarlane lived in when he was attending Rhode Island School of Design as an undergraduate in animation. The house itself also went by the nickname The Fuzzy Door during MacFarlane's residence and was the location of many \"Fuzzy Door\" parties. The company was established in 1996. The Fuzzy Door Productions logo was designed by Cory Brookes, a friend and housemate of Seth's at the Fuzzy Door residence."

Fritt Ord has significant funds and is playing a part in supporting various projects in Norway, as investing in the newspaper Morgenbladet, supporting an encyclopedia (Store Norske Leksikon) and holding a 10.1% ownership in the media group A-Pressen. In addition it awards scholarships to students within media and journalism, awards the Fritt Ord Prize, and supports writing competitions. It has also provided funding for controversial projects, e.g. an upcoming book written by the blogger Fjordman, who calls for the deportation of all Muslims from Europe. The organization awards three annual prizes to support freedom of speech; the Fritt Ord Award (Norwegian: Fritt Ords pris), the Fritt Ord Honorary Award (Norwegian: Fritt Ords honnør) and the Press Prizes for Russia and Eastern Europe (Norwegian: Pressepriser for Russland og Øst-Europa). Those prizes not to be confused with \"Ytringsfrihetsprisen\", the annual Freedom of Expression Prize awarded mostly to international writers by the Norwegian Authors' Union."

  "text" : "Friden Calculating Machine Company (Friden, Inc.) was an American manufacturer of typewriters and mechanical, later electronic calculators. It was founded by Carl Friden in San Leandro, California, in 1934. Friden electromechanical calculators were robust and popular. In 1957, Friden purchased the Commercial Controls Corporation of Rochester, New York. This gave them the Flexowriter teleprinter, an electric typewriter capable of being used as part of unit record equipment developed in World War II for the Department of the Navy to automatically type \"regret to inform you\" letters to the survivors of fallen servicemen, the predecessor to modern computers. The Flexowriter could be attached to Friden calculators and driven by paper tape to produce bills and other form letters which had names of customers and amounts of bills filled in automatically. Friden eventually expanded into production of a few models of early transistorized computers. Friden introduced the first fully transistorized desktop electronic calculator, the model EC-130 in June 1963, designed by Bob Ragen. This machine had a 13-digit capacity and a 5-inch CRT display. It used a magnetostrictive delay line for memory (delay line memory) IEEE First-Hand, to save money on expensive transistors. The EC-130 sold for $2,200, about three times the price of comparable electromechanical calculators of the time. It was the first calculator to use reverse Polish notation (RPN), which eliminated the need for parentheses to specify the order of operations in complex calculations. The successor model EC-132, introduced in April 1965, added a square root function. In 1965 the company was purchased by the Singer Corporation, but continued operation under the Friden brand name until 1974. The Singer – Friden Research Center in Oakland, California, later moved to Palo Alto, California (1965 to 1970), did not come up with an IC-based, truly pocket-sized calculator in time to compete with the corresponding new Japanese products, such as the Busicom, based on Intel 4004 in 1971, Casio Mini and Sharp EL-805 in 1972. In particular, engineer James M. Comstock, working on a pocket calculator project, did not get the necessary priority and support by management to develop such a product."

  "text" : "Fretter was an electronics and major appliance retailer based out of Detroit, Michigan, founded in the 1950s by Oliver \"Ollie\" Fretter. Fretter's first store was located on Telegraph Road just north of Interstate 96 in the city of Redford, Michigan, and the main warehouse, warehouse store and company headquarters, was on Schoolcraft Road (I-96 service drive) in Livonia. Fretter expanded his operations throughout the midwest and New England by the 1970s. The company's founder and spokesman, Ollie Fretter, became known in the Detroit area in the 1970s and 1980s by humorous TV commercials in which he promised, \"I’ll give you five pounds of coffee if I can't beat your best deal. The competition knows me. You should too!\" (When occasionally he had to make good on the whimsical offer, Fretter gave away one-pound cans of coffee that had been relabeled \"net weight — 5 pounds\".) The company paid its salespeople on a draw against commissions program, although they were paid spiffs instead of pure commission. Spiffs were calculated based on profit margin and other incentives, not based on the price of the product. Salespeople were not encouraged to sell the more expensive unit, but a model not carried by the competition which couldn't be directly price compared and therefore had a higher mark-up. Salespeople learned that the coin endings of the products directed them to which item to sell. Products with a .97 ending were high margin items and paid well; while .86 were not as profitable, and .75 were advertised items that paid very little. Clearance items were priced with repeating numbers like .66, .55, and .33 depending on how old the item was. Special order and hard to find items were priced with .71 endings and while they paid comparable to a .97 item a salesperson may get burned when the item was not in stock and/or delays in new stock arriving. Fretter maintained its marketing strategy as a low-cost retailer, even hiring outside research companies to compare prices with competitors and making that information available to sales people at their point-of-sale terminals. The move did little to sway public opinion since the chain sold higher end goods than its competitors but did not make that point clear in its advertising. Consumers were also deceived by SKU# used by competitors instead of Model# which made it difficult for a consumer to properly compare models between retailers. While Fretter and its competitors both sold a brand, they rarely sold the same models within the brand. Fretter owned a small chain of mobile electronics retailers, DASH Concepts, that installed car audio, security, and other similar products. Serving Detroit and Cleveland areas it had its main warehouse in Dearborn, Michigan, in the same building as one of the Fretter stores. The electronics retailing world was upended when the largest company, Highland, went out of business. Best Buy saw this as an opportunity to move into new territory, areas it previously felt were oversaturated by Highland and other major competitors like Fretter. Fretter management had been working to compete with the superstore model by becoming one of its own. It bought employee-owned Fred Schmid stores, giving the chain hold of markets in the mountain states. Fretter moved its corporate offices to Colorado and oversaw the merger from there. In 1993, Fretter also acquired their biggest competition of the time Silo Electronics, a company that had previously not turned a profit since the 1980s. This was an attempt by Fretter to compete with its new major competition, electronic superstores Circuit City and Best Buy, which were larger than Fretter's stores. The merger temporarily made Fretter the second largest retailer in this category, after Circuit City and larger than Best Buy, based on previous store sales, but Fretter immediately began closing redundant locations; where the company now had two or more stores in the same neighborhood. Fretter returned its main office to the Detroit area, to Brighton, Michigan. The company wanted to rebrand itself as YES! (Your Electronics Superstore) but this move did not make it to any of the stores, they all retained their original designations of Silo, Fretter, Fred Schmid, DASH Concepts, and other. The acquisition, assumption of Silo debt and lack of liquid assets, would lead the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, forcing the chain to close many locations. All Silo Electronics stores were closed by 1995, with all Fretter locations closing by May 1996. Oliver Fretter died on June 29, 2014 at the age of 91."

The company started building hang gliders and ultralight aircraft in the 1980s and added paragliders around 1992. The CT series first flew in March 1996 and was put into production in 1997. The company currently manufactures the aircraft line, which can be flown under microlight/ultralight regulations in several countries and under the Light-sport aircraft (LSA) rules in the US. Engineering design work is still performed in Germany, but much production and all assembly of the aircraft has been moved to Ukraine to lower production costs. In February 2011 the company announced that it is developing a four-seat design to be designated C4. At AirVenture 2013 the company announced that it intends to open a final assembly plant in Windham, Connecticut, United States and a plant in China in conjunction with a Taiwanese company, Aero Jones. During the 3rd quarter of 2015, Flight Design did not deliver any aircraft."

In recent times, it garnered fame from being mentioned on television series The Office. The series, set in Scranton, made reference to the restaurant in a 2005 episode in which the loser of an office warehouse basketball game buys dinner from the pub. Actor Steve Carell, who portrays Michael Scott in the NBC sitcom, allegedly told reporters he would personally fly to Scranton to \"cut the ribbon\" if Farley's were to place a \"Michael Scott Burger\" on their menu. The burger was later added. Actor Jason Miller died of a heart attack in the restaurant on May 13, 2001."

  "text" : "Fresh Choice was a chain of buffet-style restaurants which operated in California, Washington, and Texas under the names Fresh Choice, Fresh Plus, Fresh Choice Express, and Zoopa. The first restaurant was opened at Stanford Shopping Center, and the 2nd restaurant was opened in Sunnyvale, California, in 1986 by Martin Culver, Brad Wells, and Ken Oppeltz. The group took over the former Calaway's Bar and Grill in a small shopping center on El Camino Real in Sunnyvale. Opening the first restaurant for under $140,000 using funds from Martin Culver's home equity line of credit, a cash investment from Brad Wells, and the restaurant background of Ken Oppeltz, the restaurant was an immediate success. The lines out the door prompted the trio to quickly search for a second location which was opened in the Moffett Business Park. Shortly thereafter, the group was approached by a venture capital group and raised several rounds of financing for expansion. Over a few years, Fresh Choice expanded to over 50 locations in California, Texas, and Washington. Fresh Choice marketed itself as a healthier alternative to fast food restaurants with reference to menu options that include choices relatively low in fat, carbohydrates, and/or calories. All restaurants featured 50 foot salad bars, 6 freshly made soups daily, artisan pizza, and breads. Fresh Choice obtained its produce from local farmers, and tried to use seasonal, local and organically grown produce. In 2009, the company embarked on a plan to grow many of its own vegetables. The Sacramento Magazine Diners' Choice Awards voted Fresh Choice as the restaurant with the most health-conscious menu in 2008 and 2009. Fresh Choice was enrolled in PG&E's Climate Smart Program, through which Fresh Choice made voluntary, charitable contributions that fund greenhouse gas capture and reduction projects to make its Northern California restaurants' energy usage carbon neutral. Additionally, Fresh Choice sponsored and participated in events such as 2009 Earth Day in Sacramento, California International Marathon and health fairs. Fresh Choice's major competitor was Sweet Tomatoes (known as Souplantation in Southern California)."

In 2009, Fenton was selected by the Wikimedia Foundation for a $250,000 project to “build the credibility of its popular Wikipedia site and help boost the organization’s fund-raising efforts.\" The Center for Global Food Issues criticized Fenton for \"spreading fear\" related to some environmental issues, such as pesticide control, while having only weak evidence to support their position.

  "text" : "Falcon Brewery (Bryggeri AB Falken) was a brewery in Falkenberg, Sweden. After being bought by Carlsberg it is now just a brand name. The brewery was founded in 1896 by John L Skantze who picked Falkenberg because financial support was found there. In 1955 they started selling beer under the Falcon name. The company continued to grow, but after the ban on Class IIB beer the company came into difficulties and in 1977 it was bought by Pripps and was combined with Sandwalls in Borås (closed in 1981). 1985 the company was split into Falken that manufactured and Falcon that handled marketing, distribution and sales. In 1994 the company was merged as Falcon. 1989 Falcon was combined with Till breweries in Östersund. 1996 the company was sold to Carlsberg."

These boxes provide comprehensive telecommunication services such as high-speed internet, telephone and digital television packages, leading Free to become the world's number one IPTV provider offering almost systematically IPTV to subscribers and optimising it to be available on most landlines.

In 1941 the Farman brothers reestablished the firm as the \"Société Anonyme des Usines Farman\" (SAUF), but only three years later it was absorbed by Sud-Ouest. Maurice's son, Marcel Farman, reestablished the SAUF in 1952, but his effort proved unsuccessful and the firm was dissolved in 1956. The Farman brothers designed and built more than 200 types of aircraft between 1908 and 1941. They also built cars until 1931."

It evolved from studies that showed children with abnormal temporal processing and language learning impairment could have their phonological awareness improved in parallel with their temporal processing. It is currently marketed for children with a broad range of reading problems, and perhaps other cognitive disorders as well. Fast ForWord software was developed and is commercially distributed by Scientific Learning Corporation, which became a public company in 1999. Independent scientific analysis of the Fast ForWord product has shown some support for the effectiveness of the product in treating children's learning challenges.

However, Levy began to focus on designing his own components, and in 1962, the company stopped installing and servicing systems. By 1973, the company had grown substantially, and moved into a new 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building. Fire-Lite was the first company to introduce a compact, inexpensive addressable fire alarm control panel. Some of their recognizable products include the Fire-Lite BG-10 pull station, introduced in 1983, and the newer BG-12 pull station, introduced in 1993.Fire-Lite is part of the Honeywell Life Safety Group."

  "text" : "The Five-Company Agreement (五社協定 Gosha Kyōtei) was an agreement signed 1953 September 10 between five major Japanese entertainment companies (Shochiku, Toho, Daiei, Shin-Toho, and Toei). Although nominally it prohibited hiring away a cosignatory company's actors and directors, in reality intention of the agreement was to prevent actors being hired away by Nikkatsu, which had recently begun making films. It was executed mainly under the leadership of Masaichi Nagata, then president of Daiei. After the Second World War, Nikkatsu (which had been primarily active in the hotel business and such) began taking steps to return to movie production under president Hori Kyuusaku, constructing Tamagawa Film Studio (in reality, Nikkatsu Film Studio) and trying to hire directors and actors away from the five companies. To oppose this, those companies bound under Nagata's leadership agreed to the following: 1.  \n*  Hiring away actors and directors from each other would be forbidden. 2.  \n*  The occasional lending of actors and directors was also done away with. In September 1958, Nikkatsu (who had resumed film production in 1954) also participating, it became the Six-Company Agreement; in 1961, it once again became the Five-Company Agreement with the dissolution of Shin-Toho due to bankruptcy. On November 1 of that same year, the five companies ceased to offer films for television, and restricted television performances of films with company-exclusive actors. Because of this, the five companies, as well as the TV stations, began to promote many actors in the new medium. Deprived of shows with which to fill their schedule, television channels began to broadcast American films instead of Japanese films. As a distribution system had not yet been established, and there being little foreign money in public circulation at the time, the brokers known as \"transporters\" came onto the scene. The president of Pacific Ocean Television (太平洋テレビ Taiheiyou Terebi), Akira Shimizu (清水昭 Shimizu Akira), said to have been a politician's secretary, emerged as the ringleader. Given the demand for American films, inevitably the demand for organization of Japanese-side staff (production / scriptwriting / film development) rose; and, as at that time there were also points in which TV channels' knowhow was lacking, there became no work other than that in inferior circumstances, particularly voice acting in Japanese dubs."

  "text" : "FIAT Chrysler Automobiles Serbia (Serbian: FIAT Krajsler Automobili Srbija), previously known as Zastava Automobiles, is an automobile manufacturing company based in the city of Kragujevac, Serbia. It is best known for its Fiat-based automobiles, which it began assembling in 1955 for Eastern European markets. It became a subsidiary of Fiat in 2008, once fully bought by the Italian car manufacturer, and was renamed to Fiat Automobili Srbija (or Fiat Automobiles Serbia). Then the company became a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014 following the merger, then shut down of Fiat S.p.A.. On July 28, 2008, Fiat signed a letter of intent, undertaking to take control of the automobile division, investing €700 million in return for a 67 percent stake in the company (then owned by the state) and an additional €100 million of investment from the Serbian government. This was later revised to €300 million. Fiat pledged not to cut any jobs and to make good a backlog in wage payments for employees and hinted that the plant may become a dedicated Fiat production site. With this major investment, production was set to reach 330,000 units by 2012."

  "text" : "Filene's Basement, also called The Basement, was a Massachusetts-based chain of department stores which was owned by Retail Ventures, Inc. until April 2009 when it was sold to Syms. The oldest off-price retailer in the United States, Filene's Basement focused on high-end goods and was known for its distinctive, low-technology automatic markdown system. As of late 2006, the company operated stores in metropolitan areas in eight U.S. states and Washington, D.C. and used a 470,000-square-foot (44,000 m2) distribution center in Auburn, Massachusetts. The store's name was derived from the subterranean location of its flagship store, in the basement of the former Filene's department store at Downtown Crossing in Boston, Massachusetts. The flagship Downtown Crossing store closed in September 2007 while the building above it underwent construction and had been set to reopen following the conclusion of the construction. The 2009 economic crisis negatively impacted the chain, prompting the closing of many stores and the eventual sale of the chain from Retail Ventures, Inc. to Buxbaum Group, which filed for bankruptcy in May 2009. Filene's Basement was then sold to Syms Corporation, which also owns the Syms chain of off-price stores. In November 2011, Syms filed for bankruptcy, resulting in a liquidation sale. The last Filene's Basement stores closed permanently on December 29, 2011. In 2012, private equity firm Trinity Place Holdings acquired by brand copyright to Filene's Basement. In fall of 2015, Filene's Basement was reopened exclusively as an online retailer."

The organisation is a joint venture between the country's major free to air broadcasters – government owned Television New Zealand and Radio New Zealand, government subsidised Māori Television, and the Australian owned Ironbridge Capital company MediaWorks New Zealand (operators of TV3, FOUR and The Edge TV). The Freeview service consists of a high definition-capable digital terrestrial television service, called Freeview|HD, to around 86% of the population in the major urban and provincial centres of New Zealand, and a standard definition digital satellite television service, called Freeview Satellite, covering the whole of mainland New Zealand and the major offshore islands. Freeview uses the DVB-S and DVB-T standards on government provided spectrum. The Freeview service started in May 2007, introducing free-to-air digital television to the country and preparing for analogue switchoff, which began on 30 September 2012 and was completed on 1 December 2013. In 2014 it was estimated that Freeview makes up approximately 61.7% of the digital television share in New Zealand. Freeview-certified set-top boxes and IDTVs, as well as PVRs, are available at most major New Zealand retailers. Uncertified equipment can also be used to receive the service, which may have advantages (cheaper, extra features, international channels) and disadvantages (no/limited EPG, no auto-retuning) over certified equipment."

Nowadays, Fleischmann is a well-established brand name in the German model railway industry, rivalling Märklin in market share. Since they focus almost exclusively on central European prototypes, Fleischmann is relatively unknown outside that area. Most Fleischmann H0 products are made for the two-rail direct current system, but they make three-rail, Märklin-compatible versions of some locomotives, as well as replacement non-insulated wheelsets for use with their wagons on three-rail systems."

The company later relocated to the brothers' home town of Gütenbach in the Black Forest. Faller now specializes in making scenery, plastic model kits and other accessories for model railroads but has manufactured a range of toys during its history, such as model aeroplane kits, the Auto Motor Sport (AMS) slot car racing sets and die-cast model cars. Their modern product line includes railway structures, houses and commercial buildings, bridges, amusement rides and terrain accessories in H0, N, TT and Z scales, as well as the Car System. Since 1997 Faller also owns the Pola brand, which is now solely devoted to G scale structures. Faller's older toys and models can be highly collectable today, together with their early product catalogues."

  "text" : "Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) (also known as FBO Pictures Corporation) was an American film studio of the silent era, a producer and distributor of mostly low-budget films. The business began in 1918 as Robertson-Cole (U.S.), the American division of a British import–export company and Robertson-Cole was formed by the English-born Harry F. Robertson and the American Rufus Sidman Cole. Robertson-Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges (formerly the Mutual Exchanges that became known as Exhibitors-Mutual Exchanges) from Frank J. Hall in 1920. Exhibitors-Mutual/Hallmark had distributed Robertson-Cole product, and acquiring the exchanges gave them the right to distribute their own films plus Hall's product, with the exception of Charlie Chaplin reissues he had the rights to. Robertson-Cole initiated movie production in the United States in 1920. That year, it incorporated Robertson-Cole Studios, Inc. and bought 460 acres in Santa Monica, California to establish a studio. The property, which became known as the \"R.C. Ranch\", enabled Robertson-Cole to centralize movie production, which previously had been scattered. The movie company had relied on equipment rentals to produce motion pictures. Two years later, a corporate reorganization led to the company's new name, with FBO becoming the official name of the distributing operation and Robertson-Cole Pictures Corp. the name of the production operation. In 1923, the studio contracted with Western actor Fred Thomson, who would soon emerge as one of Hollywood's most popular stars. Thomson was just one of numerous screen cowboys with whom FBO became identified. The studio, whose core market was America's small towns, also put out many romantic melodramas, non-Western action pictures, and comedic shorts. In 1926, financier Joseph P. Kennedy led a group that acquired the company. In June 1928, using RCA Photophone technology, FBO became only the second Hollywood studio to release a feature-length \"talkie.\" A few months later, Kennedy and RCA chief David Sarnoff arranged the merger that created RKO, one of the major studios of Hollywood's Golden Age."

  "text" : "F. Hinds is a jewellery retailing chain, operating in England and Wales. There are currently 113 F Hinds stores within the United Kingdom. The chain is an independent retailer which was founded in 1856 by George Henry Hinds, although his father Joseph was also a clockmaker in Stamford, Lincolnshire. Shortly after the First World War, brothers Frank and William divided the business in two. William Hinds diversified into theatres and also into films as he was one of the two founders of Hammer Film Productions, the studio famous for horror films. Frank continued with the jewellery business and eventually, in 1990, F. Hinds took over the one remaining shop owned by the other half of the family in Worthing, Sussex. Unlike most companies established 150 years ago, the sixth generation of the Hinds family still owns and manages the business. Diamond buyer Andrew Hinds is personally responsible for selecting the diamonds sold by the company. In 2014 Andrew Hinds was elected Chairman of the UK jewellery trade body the National Association of Goldsmiths. F. Hinds stores stock a wider than average range of jewellery, watches, clocks, collectible and gift ranges. They are usually to be found within shopping centres, or on High Streets. The stores can be found in many towns and out of town malls. Brands operated by F. Hinds include My Diamonds diamond jewellery, the Night and Day black and white diamond collection and the Kilimanjaro Tanzanite collection. The chain was one of the first click and mortar jewellers, having launched its first ecommerce site in 1997. They are one of the national retailers on the Barclaycard Freedom loyalty scheme and also specialise in recycling unwanted gold jewellery into new pieces, offering over 100% of the value of the gold exchanged. In 2008, F Hinds joined the Responsible Jewellery Council, an international not-for-profit organisation established to reinforce consumer confidence in the jewellery industry by advancing responsible business practices throughout the supply chain, and in August 2011 they were one of the first members to become fully accredited following an independent audit."

  "text" : "Fiorucci is an Italian fashion label founded by Elio Fiorucci in 1967. The first shop exposed Milan to the styles of Swinging London and American classics such as the T-shirt and jeans. By the late 1970s and early 1980s this would be reversed, and the New York store would become famous for the fashions it introduced to the United States. Known as the \"daytime Studio 54\", it attracted trendsetters from Andy Warhol to a young Madonna. As a leader in the globalisation of fashion Fiorucci would scour the globe, introducing a newly affluent mass market to underground trends such as thongs from Brazil and Afghan coats. The label popularised camouflage prints and leopard-skin prints before creating the designer jean market with the invention of stretch jeans. The iconic advertising usually featured a woman's buttocks in skin-tight denim, or in one case obscured by pink fluffy handcuffs, whilst the company logo is two cheeky angels modelled after Raphael's cherubs. However, mismanagement of the company led to receivership in 1989, and since then the brand has been dogged by legal battles over the trademarks, and several relaunches have failed to make much impact. Elio Fiorucci was found dead in his Milan home on July 20, 2015, at the age of 80. Relatives say he was in \"good health\" before his death, but he may have succumbed to sudden illnesses later on."

  "text" : "Freud Communications is a public relations firm based in London. It was founded in 1985 by Matthew Freud—of the Public Relations dynasty of Edward Bernays—and great-grandson of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud). The PR firm of Edward Bernays became Britain's largest independent consumer PR firm. The firm was bought in 1994 by another independent UK agency, Abbott Mead Vickers (AMV), in 1994 for about 10 million pounds only for Matthew Freud, together with other partners, to buy back the company in 2001, for a similar sum, when AMV was itself purchased by the US group Omnicom. The French Publicis Groupe (the third largest communications firm in the world) acquired a 50.1% stake in Freud Communications in June, 2005. In 2006 Freud purchased advertising agency DFGW. Freud Communications USA, which closed in February 2009, was based in New York City. The company had a turnover in 2011 of around £40million per year, a staff of more than two hundred and has been ranked by PR Week in their ranking system as 6th in the UK. In 1999 Leapman reported in The Times that Freud Communications had offered an Internet brand management service to its clients. This would \"scour the Net for references to its clients\" and if they were criticised, \"the agency would use rebuttal tactics to minimise the potentially negative impact of online inaccuracy\". In 2007 PR Week ran a story documenting the use of WikiScanner to track anonymous edits and link them to organizations through their IP addresses and found that \"Freud Communications' London office was caught making edits on behalf of clients.\""

  "text" : "Fingerhut is a catalog/online retailer. Fingerhut was founded in 1948 by William Fingerhut and his brother Manny, selling automobile seat covers. In 1952, the business re-positioned itself to a mail order catalog company and diversified its goods to include towels, dishes, and tools. In 1969 the company went public. In 1994, Fingerhut sponsored the #98 NASCAR Ford Thunderbird for Cale Yarborough Motorsports. Derrike Cope started the year in the #98 car, before he was replaced later on by Jeremy Mayfield. Today, Fingerhut is distinguished from other online retailers in that customers can pay with credit, and make monthly payments until their orders are paid off. The Fingerhut brand has passed through several ownerships during its existence, including onetime ownership by American Can Company and its successor Primerica, Federated Department Stores (1999), and Petters Group Worldwide (2002), and Bain Capital Ventures (2004). The company has received criticism for allegedly engaging in practices such as robocalls. In 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed in response to Fingerhut nuisance robocalls."

The name \"flooz\" was based upon the Arabic word for money, فلوس, fuloos. Users accumulated flooz credits either as a promotional bonus given away by some internet businesses or purchased directly from flooz.com which then could be redeemed for merchandise at a variety of participating online stores. Adoption of flooz by both merchants and customers proved limited, and it never established itself as a widely recognized medium of exchange, which hindered both its usefulness and appeal."

  "text" : "The Fabbri Group (AKA Fabbri) is an Italian amusement rides manufacturer, based in Bergantino, a northern village of Italy. Fabbri was founded in 1950, just after World War II, by Romolo Fabbri. He found a way to convert war surplus material into 'a new productive means that could give new joy and hope for the future'. Manufacturing also began in 1950 with Fabbri's first ride, the Avio (Aeroplane Ride) specifically designed for traveling shows in Italy. In the 1970s Romolo's son, Licinio Fabbri, took over direction of the company, and expanded sales beyond Italy into the rest of the European continent. Fabbri expanded its sales once again in the 1980s to include the world market. As demand for rides increased, Fabbri decided that instead of concentrating on one main facility, several affiliate companies would be formed, all located in nearby towns, each specialising in its own type of ride. In 1998 the multiple factories were brought together under the name the Fabbri Group. Fabbri Group offers a large range of rides from children's rides, to launch coasters. The Fabbri Group entered the coaster market in 1998 with the introduction of a Wacky-Worm type ride. The Fabbri Group is most well known for manufacturing the Booster. Fabbri is also gaining attention from the rather intense Mega Drop which is a freefall attraction that shoots riders down instead of a true freefall, giving better g-forces than other larger freefall rides. The Mega Drop is currently the newest attraction at the Rose Festival City Fair, located in Portland, Oregon."

  "text" : "Fischer Motor Company is a US-based sport motorcycle manufacturer. Their MRX 650 is a sport bike built around a 90-degree V-twin engine and a one-piece, twin spar, aluminum perimeter frame. Alan Cathcart of Motorcyclist magazine in his 2006 test review, called the MRX, \"the most important new American motorcycle in generations.\" Company founder Daniel Fischer developed the company's first motorcycle for mass-production, the MRX 650 using suppliers including an EADS (Airbus) subsidiary for engineering, Harley-Davidson and Michael Jordan Motorsports contractor Gemini Technology Systems for frame development, and various companies related to US-based heavy equipment and automotive suppliers for other components. The original platform is based upon a 1990s era Grand Prix chassis. In contrast to Buell Motorcycle Company, Fischer intended not to \"reinvent the wheel\" with any radical design concepts, but to \"just take existing technology and fine-tune it,\" Fischer told Cycle World in 2003. Styling for the new motorcycle was done by British designer Glynn Kerr. In earlier stages, there were plans to produce 1,000–1,500 cc (61–92 cu in) Rotax-based 90° V-twins. Rotax subsequently voided an agreement with Fischer in order to supply engines to Harley's Buell, with the Rotax 1000cc v-twin which had been used in Aprilia products and Fischer's first prototype ultimately supplied in a revised version for Buell 1125-series products. As of April 2009, Fischer had begun shipping units, and in October 2009 announced a production increase for the 2010 model year. Fischer appears to have ceased production in 2012. A \"few dozen\" bikes were produced during the Fischer's three years of operation. In 2015, an Indian motorcycle blog reported that Fischer had plans to make an entry into India with its new 150 cc bikes, likely to be named Fischer MRX 150."

  "text" : "Facebook (stylized as facebook) is an American for-profit corporation and online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, California, United States. The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students. Facebook can be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen. Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts."

  "text" : "Fiesta Mart Inc. is an American supermarket chain based in Houston, Texas that was established in 1972. Fiesta Mart stores are located in Texas. The chain uses a cartoon parrot as a mascot. As of 2004 it operated 34 supermarkets in Greater Houston, 16 supermarkets in other locations in Texas, and 17 Beverage Mart liquor store locations. During the same year it had 7.5% of the grocery market share in Greater Houston. Many of its stores were located in Hispanic neighborhoods and other neighborhoods with minority ethnic groups. The chain caters to Hispanic and ethnic customers; Allison Wollam of the Houston Business Journal said \"The company has been successful at targeting the Hispanic market and specifically catering to their needs and shopping styles.\" Bernie Murphy, a spokesperson for Fiesta, said in 2006 that at some stores Hispanics make up to 70% of that store's clientele. Fiesta caters to these customers with a large selection of foods and ingredients that are generally not available at a typical grocery store. Fiesta stores also often include several other stores owned by independent operators, such as discount jewelry and banking. Fiesta also operates Fiesta Liquor Stores, where only alcohol is sold."

FSM’s consulting clients include Dunkin’ Donuts, Gulf Oil, JetBlue, & Santander. In addition, FSM purchased the Salem Avalanche, a minor league baseball franchise in the High Class A Carolina League, in December 2007. On September 19, 2008, FSM announced that the Salem franchise, eventually renamed the Salem Red Sox, would replace the Lancaster JetHawks as Boston's High A affiliate in 2009.

In January 2014, FSM became the marketer of the global rights of 2012 Heisman Trophy winner and Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, in a management partnership deal with LRMR Management.

  "text" : "Fox Sports Digital Media, formerly known as News Corp. Digital Media and Fox Interactive Media, is a subsidiary of Fox Entertainment Group which operates Fox Sports' online properties in the United States. When known as Fox Interactive Media, it was formed to oversee News Corporation's new media acquisitions, including IGN, Myspace and Photobucket. However, the group would later divest most of its properties; in 2006, Demand Media, a company run by Richard Rosenblatt, former CEO of Intermix Media and chairman of Myspace, purchased back all of the non-MySpace assets Intermix had sold to News Corporation. In December 2009, Fox sold Photobucket to the startup digital photography company Ontela. In October 2010, the Fox Audience Network was sold to ad technology firm Rubicon Project. Fox Interactive Media also operated the websites of Fox's television stations. As part of a joint venture with LIN Media in 2008, Fox Interactive Media also began offering the Digital Publishing Platform (DPP), an enterprise content management system and hosting platform primarily intended for local station websites. The DPP products were later spun off as the independent company EndPlay, which Fox and LIN still hold equity interests in. Fox would begin outsourcing their television station websites to competing provider Worldnow in 2012. In June 2011, Specific Media and pop singer Justin Timberlake bought Myspace for $35 million, which CNN reported noted was \"far less than the $580 million News Corp. paid for Myspace in 2005.\" Murdoch went on to call the Myspace purchase a \"huge mistake\". In February 2013, IGN Entertainment was sold to Ziff Davis Media. As its only remaining properties relate to Fox Sports, the company was renamed Fox Sports Digital Media in mid-2013."

  "text" : "Flying Bison Brewing Company is a brewery in Buffalo, New York, USA, in the city's Riverside neighborhood. The brewery incorporated in 1995, opened for business in 2000, was started by two majority partners, Phil Internicola and Tim Herzog, along with 25 individual investors. The brewery began operations as a 20-barrel facility. In early 2004, it installed a full bottling line and upgraded its production capacity by adding a 40 barrel fermenter. The brewery has since expanded by more than 200% adding 4 more 40 barrel fermenters. It presently distributes its products to bars, restaurants and retail outlets in Erie, Niagara, and Chautauqua counties. Flying Bison is the first stand-alone brewery to operate in Buffalo since the Iroquois Brewing Company closed in 1972. Flying Bison draws its name in part from Buffalo's rich history of aviation manufacturing. The brewery's Dawn Patrol Gold Kölsch is named in honor of the Curtiss JN-4 \"Jenny\" biplane that was built in a factory on Niagara Street in Buffalo and flew dawn patrols off the east coast of England during World War I. Flying Bison attributed a rise in the cost of ingredients to severe financial difficulty which caused a brief halt in production in 2010. A sale of the brewery to F. X. Matt Brewing Co., the Utica, New York-based makers of Saranac beer rescued the brewery. The terms of the sale stated that Matt was a parent company and that production would continue in Buffalo. In 2014, the company announced their intention to build a new brewery in the Larkinville district of Buffalo, vacating their longtime home on Ontario Street. The new brewery is expected to open in the fall of 2014. It will increase their output to as much as 10,000 BBL annually, grow jobs from ten to 16 employees, and add a taproom and patio space for events and sales by the pint. Flying Bison beers distributed in Western New York by Try-It Distributing can be found at Wegmans Food Markets, Consumer's Beverages, which is a local beer store chain in the Buffalo area, and many establishments throughout Western New York."

The label started off in the back of a music retail store in Chelmsford, called Soundworld. It began by selling a small range of guitars, this quickly grew into a huge variety of instruments, and soon after ending up buying out the other businesses in the shop, and taking 100% control. Within 6 years over 30 Soundworlds were open all over the UK and the business was quickly expanding. Due to the unexpected success of Soundworld, the company decided to reach into the market and launch a record label directly aimed at the jazz and improvised music market. Some of the releases prominently feature percussion."

  "text" : "Fleet Support Limited (FSL) is a British company formed to run HMNB Portsmouth's Fleet Maintenance and Repair Organisation (FMRO) on a commercial basis. The FMRO was an agency of the Ministry of Defence responsible for repair and maintenance of Royal Navy vessels. FSL performs this task but also undertakes commercial work such as shiprepair, refitting, conversion and hull fabrication. FSL also carries out heavy engineering work and nondestructive testing for the marine and engineering sectors. FSL was founded as a joint venture between Vosper Thornycroft (now VT Group) and GEC-Marconi. GEC's 50% share passed to its successor BAE Systems in 1999. In July 2008 BAE Systems and VT Group merged their military shipbuilding businesses to form BVT Surface Fleet. This included FSL, which was rebranded as BVT Surface Fleet Support Limited. In 2009 this became BAE Systems Surface Ships, with complete ownership passing to BAE Systems and the company being renamed BAE Systems Surface Ships Support Limited. In January 2012, BAE Systems Surface Ships Support was restructured, joining with parts of Insyte to become BAE Systems Maritime - Maritime Services."

Due to significant losses on its UK activity (including transfer costs), which contributed over 70% of revenue, Freshtel announced in February 2010 that an agreement had been reached with Tesco to terminate the VOIP services it had provided. In May 2010 Freshtel announced that it had sold its UK operation for $150,000."

It had plans for rapid growth – the first stores opened in November 2007 and, after a pause in the second quarter of 2008, the opening program recommenced. While there were over 200 stores in Arizona, California, and Nevada by December 2012, Tesco confirmed in April 2013 that it was pulling out of the US market, at a reported cost of £1.2 billion. On September 10, 2013, Tesco announced they were transferring ownership and operations of more than 150 stores to supermarket-owner Ron Burkle's Yucaipa Companies group. At the beginning of October 2013, Fresh & Easy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. bankruptcy court. The sale cost Tesco £150m, taking the total cost of its failed US venture to nearly £2bn. On October 23, 2015, Yucaipa announced that it would close all Fresh & Easy stores. On October 30, 2015, Fresh & Easy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in two years."

  "text" : "Film Ventures International (FVI) was an independent movie production and distribution company originally situated in Atlanta, Georgia during the 1970s. FVI garnered a notorious reputation within the industry for producing films which were highly derivative of many blockbusters of the era. The company mainly specialized in producing and distributing B-Movies and horror fare. The entrepreneur who spearheaded the company was Edward L. Montoro. He wrote, directed and produced the company's first feature film Getting Into Heaven in 1968. The adult film was made for $13,000 and grossed almost 20 times its cost. FVI was known for acquiring Italian genre films and distributing them within the United States. These films included the 1968 spaghetti western Boot Hill, a sequel to the famous Trinity films; and the 1974 horror thriller Beyond the Door starring Juliet Mills. FVI acquired Beyond the Door for $100,000 and the film went on to earn $9 million at the box office, making it one of the most successful independent releases of that year. Detailing a Woman possessed by a demon, Beyond the Door was labeled a rip-off of The Exorcist. Warner Bros. promptly filed a lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement. The lawsuit failed after it was determined Warner Bros. had no rights to key horror scenes depicted in The Exorcist. FVI produced and distributed Grizzly in 1976, one of the first of the Jaws clones. Montoro financed the film for $750,000 and it was directed by William Girdler. Grizzly was a surprise hit, earning more than $39 million and becoming the most financially successful independent film of 1976. Montoro decided to keep the profits for himself, resulting in a lawsuit against FVI by Girdler and producer/screenwriters Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon. FVI eventually returned the profits to the filmmakers. Montoro's FVI worked with Girdler on the animal horror thriller The Day of the Animals the following year, though the collaboration did not achieve the success of Grizzly. Montoro eventually moved FVI's headquarters to Hollywood and began churning out multiple genre films over the next seven years including Search and Destroy (1979) starring Don Stroud; The Dark (1979) starring William Devane, The Visitor (1979) starring Glenn Ford, H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come (1979) starring Jack Palance, Kill and Kill Again (1981), The Incubus (1981) starring John Cassavetes, Texas Lightning (1981) starring Cameron Mitchell, Pieces (1982) starring Christopher George, They Call Me Bruce? (1982), Pod People (1983), Vigilante (1983) starring Robert Forster, The House on Sorority Row (1983), Mortuary (1983) starring Bill Paxton, The Power (1984), Alley Cat (1984), and Mutant (1984) starring Bo Hopkins. In 1980, FVI acquired the rights to the Italian film Great White, a thinly veiled Jaws rip-off starring James Franciscus and Vic Morrow. Montoro and FVI spent over $4 million in advertising in the U.S., but Universal Pictures promptly filed suit, claiming that the film was too derivative of Jaws. Universal won the lawsuit and Great White was pulled from the theaters after one week of release. The failure of Great White was a major monetary loss for FVI. By 1984, FVI was on the verge of collapse due to multiple financial issues including the release failure of Great White, the poor box office performance of FVI's final film Mutant, and a pending divorce settlement of Montoro's. Surprising many within the industry, Montoro took one million dollars from FVI and vanished never to be seen again. Film Ventures International officially closed its doors in 1985, filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy and later being purchased by the INI Corporation. To this day, Montoro's whereabouts remain unknown, though it is believed he fled to Mexico."

  "text" : "Finetech GmbH & Co. KG makes equipment for various kinds of rework and micro assembly operations. Finetech GmbH (Berlin, Germany) is a manufacturer of high-accuracy equipment for leading-edge bonding, micro assembly and rework of semiconductor components and other leading-edge devices. Founded in 1992 in East Berlin, the company’s first product was a system with only one moving part and a fixed optical prism, keeping the system simple yet accurate. By combining highly accurate optical alignment and a unique method of heating and cooling air/nitrogen for solder reflow, Finetech began providing systems for the Surface Mount Technology industry for reworking Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) and other very precise components. In 1996, Finetech introduced its first tabletop system with a placement accuracy of one micron. This system is widely used in many areas of the electronics industry including flip chip, photonics, sensors, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, bio-medical devices, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), chip-to-wafer, light-emitting diodes, and many others. In 2009, Finetech acquired Martin GmbH, a manufacturer of rework and dispensing equipment located in Wessling, Germany. This allowed Finetech to offer a more complete range of rework systems; from simple hand soldering technology and basic entry-level rework systems, to advanced rework and integrated dispense for its bonding equipment applications. Finetech systems are commonly used for academic and R&D purposes and can be found in many university and government research labs including; Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Sandia Labs, NASA, and The Fraunhofer Institute. The company services customers in a broad range of industries including universities and research, aerospace, medical technology, consumer electronics, semiconductor, optoelectronics and photonics, and military. The company holds an ISO 9001 certification."

Michael Kvamme, an aspiring young comedian, came up with a concept for a new kind of comedy site; and the site was developed by Randy Adams. Videos are voted on by users of the site; those that are deemed funny stay, but those that are not \"die\" and are relegated to the site's \"crypt\". Funny Or Die launched on April 12, 2007 with the site's first video, \"The Landlord\". \"The Landlord\" has received over 84 million views and features Ferrell confronted by a swearing, beer-drinking two-year-old landlord. In June 2007, they received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, and in June 2008, they announced a partnership with HBO. On August 3, 2016, Funny or Die shut-down one of its California offices, reducing its headcount by 30% to 95 employees, with the announcement coming just two month after the new CEO, Mike Farah, took office"

  "text" : "First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology. In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013. The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016. First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies. In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies. It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors."

  "text" : "The Ferro Alloys Corporation Limited (FACOR) was floated in 1955 by the house of Sarafs and Mors to become the first major producer of ferromanganese in India. The year 1956, marked the beginning of the Ferro Alloys Corporation Limited at Sriramnagar, Garividi, Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh. The founder was Seth Shriman Durgaprasadji Saraf (1911–1988). The registered office is at Tumsar, Bhandara district, Maharashtra. Ferroalloys are used as deoxidizers and alloy additives in the Steel manufacturing process. The ferromanganese plant started production in 1957, equipped with three furnaces for production of high carbon ferromanganese and ferrosilicon. In 1969, a reduction furnace and a slag furnace were commissioned for production of ferrochrome. The company independently, set up a 16 MVA furnace in 1981. FACOR acquired a small steel plant at Nagpur in Maharashtra. In 1979, FACOR developed the technology to produce charge chrome in their own R&D wing. They have established a charge chrome plant at D.P.Nagar, Randia in Bhadrak district of Orissa in 1983. It is a 100% Export Oriented Project with a production capacity of 50,000 tons per annum. FACOR signed an agreement with Marc Rich and Co. AG Switzerland, as the sole selling agent of their entire charge chrome output for 10 years. The plants at Sriramnagar have facilities for raw material handling, metal and slag casting, crushing, sizing and other ancillaries apart from furnaces for smelting of ferro alloys. The raw materials are manganese ore, chromite and quartzite ores with principal elements of manganese, chromium and silicon respectively. They are obtained from the Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar states. The Ferro Alloys produced are High Carbon Ferro Chrome, Low Carbon Ferro Chrome, Silico Chrome, Silico Manganese and Magnesium Ferro Silicon, Ferro Manganese etc., These alloys are tapped from electric arc furnaces in molten state. They are prepared to the required size from 25 mm to 150 mm and transported to the various steel companies. The furnaces are connected to Two-stage venturi scrubber systems to maintain a clean environment in and around the production area. FACOR has been accredited under ISO 9001:2000. The existing manpower at Sriramnagar is about 784 regular employees with 107 supervisory personnel, besides 1070 contract workmen. In 2003, the charge chrome division along with the mining division in Orissa has been demerged as FACOR STEELS Ltd and the Ferro Alloys division at Garividi as FACOR ALLOYS Ltd."

  "text" : "Football Fans Census (sometimes known as FFC), is the trading name of Football Fans Central Ltd, a small  market research company which specialises in research into the views and opinions of English football supporters. When the free-to-air digital sports channel ITV Digital collapsed in 2002; it reportedly owed £178.5m to Football League clubs. Two football fans began a campaign for ITV Digital's parent entities, the regional ITV companies Granada Television and Carlton Television to repay this money to the clubs. The campaign, under the name Football Fans Union, took the form of a protest against the companies resulting in the 'Can the Commercials' petition and direct action. The group asked football fans to boycott ITV's World Cup 2002 coverage, and in particular to switch channels during advertisements; so that advertisers would bring pressure on ITV and impact on the companies' advertising revenues. The fans' campaign ran alongside legal action by the Football League; but it proved to be unsuccessful when the Court of Appeal threw out the Football League's action in 2006. The impetus created by this campaign led to the Football Fans Union developing into the Football Fans Census; and a desire to be a voice for football supporters through online surveys and opinion polls. Past surveys include: \n*  the return of terraces   \n*  the quality of food at games  \n*  the cost of following a football team  \n*  the state of English football"

In May 2011, Fakta had 374 stores with around 6000 employees.Fakta has since October 2011 been running all stores (excluding Fakta Quick) with the opening hours 8 am - 9 pm. Since the change in the law regarding opening hours, all of Faktas' shops (excluding a very few) has the opening hours 8 am - 10 pm. Fakta's previous slogan was: \"Det ta'r kun 5 minutter at handle i Fakta, men vi vil så gerne ha' at du bli'r lidt længere\", which translated into English means: \"It only takes 5 minutes to shop in Fakta, but we really want you to stay a bit longer\". It was replaced in 2011 with \"Det er sund fornuft\" which literally translates to \"It's common sense\". The slogan was later replaced with \"Det er Fakta\" which translates to \"It's a fact\" or \"It's Fakta\". The old slogan \"Det er sund fornuft\" however, does still exist, as it is printed on products sold under Faktas' own name."

  "text" : "The Fundamental Baptist churches which were the fruits of ABWE, BBSI and DBBI ministries formed the Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches in the Philippines(AFBCP) with 7 regional associations some of which were organized even earlier: 1.  \n*  Association of Baptist Churches in Northern Luzon 2.  \n*  Association of Baptist Churches in Central Luzon 3.  \n*  Association of Baptist Churches in Southern Tagalog 4.  \n*  Palawan Association of Baptist Churches 5.  \n*  Visayan Fellowship of Fundamental Baptist Churches 6.  \n*  Bukidnon Association of Baptist Churches 7.  \n*  Davao Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches Providentially, the AFBCP became a member of the International Council of Christian Churches and was frequently represented by Pastor Antonio Ormeo and Pastor Epifanio de la Pena in the early days of their involvement with the AFBCP and the ABWE. As the AFBCP was the National Association representing the ICCC in the Philippines, so was the National Council of Churches in the Philippines for the WCC(World Council of Churches). This sparked the already seething controversy between Biblical Christianity and the \"Laodicean\" version of Christianity in the country."

The company was for a long time known for its staunch policy not to sell the domain names it owns; a policy at odds with that of most other domain name profiteers. It serves as the second greatest example of domain squatting (second to most \"Domain Registrars\") . In 2014 FMA made headlines when it moved its registered names (some of which are among the most valuable on the Web) to Uniregistry for safekeeping. Some speculate this change signals a softening in FMA's position, not to sell its name assets. The CEO of FMA now lives in London, UK. There are several legal cases which FMA is and has been involved in some of which seem to have propped up his company against his immediate family."

Founded in 1998 by Mike Becker, the company was originally conceived by Becker as a small project to bring back various low-tech, nostalgia-themed toys in the high-tech world of today. Funko's first manufactured bobblehead was of the restaurant advertising icon Big Boy. Sold in 2005, Funko LLC is now headed by Brian Mariotti as president. Since 2005, the company has increased the scope of unique toy lines, and has signed licensing deals with Marvel, DC Comics, WWE, Lucasfilm, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, Hasbro, CBS, Fox, Warner Bros, Disney, HBO, Peanuts, BBC, NFL, Ubisoft, NBCUniversal, Cartoon Network, 2K Games, Bethesda Games, and many more. Funko products now have worldwide distribution. According to Mariotti, \"We were in the $40 million range for revenue [in 2013] — and $28 million of that was from Pop figures alone.\" In 2015, Funko added Mopeez, Dorbz, Vinyl Idolz, Vinyl Vixens, and Super Deluxe vinyl to their existing lines."

  "text" : "Fisker Automotive was an automaker originally based in Anaheim, California, founded by Henrik Fisker in 2007. The company's first product was the Fisker Karma, one of the world's first production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, and first deliveries were in 2011. Production was suspended in November 2012 due to bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems, with about 2,450 Karmas built since 2011. The assets of the company were purchased by Wanxiang America, Corp., a Chinese auto-parts maker. Since Henrik Fisker owned the Fisker trademarks and the Fisker Brand, Wanxiang had to rename the company Karma Automotive. Fisker originally intended to sell the Karma in late 2009, but after repeated delays, the Environmental Protection Agency certified the car’s vehicle emissions and drive range in October 2011, and thereafter Fisker commenced delivery of production vehicles in the USA. Fisker's problems started with recall of its battery by A123 in December 2011, followed by the bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems in August 2012, the costs involved regarding a recall and repairs to customer cars. In addition to production stopping for over five months, with no date announced to recommence, the planned production of the second model, the Fisker Atlantic, was postponed, together with the cessation of development of the new model. Fisker eventually declared bankruptcy in November 2013, and in February 2014, the designs, engineering, and manufacturing facility of the company were bought by Chinese auto-parts conglomerate Wanxiang Group excluding the Fisker Brand and Fisker trademarks owned by Henrik Fisker."

The first city to take this strategy and follow it through to maturity is found in Birmingham, AL (approx 20 years old). The vision of First Priority is to see the Hope of Christ in every student in America. The way they implement the vision is to unite the body of Christ with a plan of action to influence the schools with the gospel. The distinction on First Priority is to empower the 325,000 Evangelical churches to reach the students in 69,000 Middle and High schools. This plan makes First Priority a local church strategy rather than a para-church ministry."

The company is known for its wide range of high quality sharpening steels and is also renowned for its chef's knives where it is a respected manufacturer in the professional sector, but less established for the casual user. Although F. Dick cutlery is available for purchase in the American market, the brand has not caught-on with mainstream American consumers. As a result, the brand is limited in its availability, and is generally only available at cutlery specialty-stores in the American market. F. Dick also manufactures industrial grade and kitchen grade sharpening solutions. These range from advanced semi-automated wet-grinding machines to honing-steels. F. Dick is mentioned by name in Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential. Specifically, he notes the offset serrated knife that is manufactured by the company."

  "text" : "Frontwing Co., Ltd. (株式会社フロントウイング Kabushikigaisha Furonto Uingu) is a Japanese visual novel studio that specializes in the production of adult visual novels. Its main office is located in Taito City, Tokyo. The representative producer and president is Ryūichirō Yamakawa. “Frontwing” is the company’s main brand, but it has also released games under affiliated brands “Survive” (サヴァイブ), “Hotchkiss” (ホチキス), and “b-wing”. These brands have all since merged to become “Frontwing”. Frontwing’s games cover a diverse range of genres, from school love life stories to hardcore adult games, and also games that utilize 3D computer graphics. The 3D content production team, Polygon Mura (ポリゴン村), is closely involved in the games’ production by seeking ways to incorporate 3D graphics into essentially 2D projects. Several of their games, originally produced for PC, have been ported to consoles. The development of the ported versions is generally done in-house. The company is also active in many other fields, including the development of the dance 3D software Dance X Mixer, taking part in the bi-annual Comic Market, and Niconico live broadcasts. Since the company's founding in 1999 as a bishōjo games developer and the release of Frontwing's first title, Canary (Canaria: Kono Omoi o Uta ni Nosete) in August 2000, it has published over 20 titles in the visual novel genre. The studio’s flagship games include the Netherworld Angel Djibril series, and the Grisaia trilogy which spawned an animated series in 2015. In regards to the Djibril series, writer Naoki Miyamoto, author of the book \"Adult Games: Introduction to Cultural Studies”, has pointed out why there is a big demand for such works: “If the one to fight is a beautiful heroine, the risks she takes stimulate people's erotic imagination.” In 2011, the first installment of the Grisaia Series, The Fruit of Grisaia, won first place in the Moe Game Award. The second installment, The Labyrinth of Grisaia, won second place in 2012. Frontwing marked its first venture into the overseas market May 29, 2015, with the English release of The Fruit of Grisaia on Steam. The company has since established its own in-house translation team, which made its debut with the English release of The Leisure of Grisaia on May 18, 2016."

  "text" : "Friedman's Inc. was a US company that owned and operated fine jewelry specialty stores under the names Friedman's Jewelers and Crescent Jewelers. The company declared bankruptcy in 2008 and had shuttered all stores by June 2008. The company was established in Savannah, Georgia in 1920. Friedman's Inc. was headquartered in Addison, Texas. They were the third largest jewelry company in the US. Friedman's stressed value and low prices, owning the trademark \"The Value Leader\" and advertising \"Unbeatable Values\". Unlike many chain jewelers, Friedman's had many of its locations in power centers and strip malls, besides enclosed malls and outlet centers. The company had stated that they preferred locations anchored by a discounter \"big box\" store, almost always Wal-Mart. This fits with their core demographic of lower to middle income customers between 18 and 40. Due to a bankruptcy filing in early 2008, Friedman's and Crescent liquidated all of their stores save for a small number of locations purchased by Whitehall Jewelers Inc. for approximately 14 million dollars. Whitehall went bankrupt shortly after the purchase and began liquidating all of its stores in August 2008."

The company made a deal to purchase Pisek Airport in 2007 and this took needed cash out of the manufacturing operation. The company was declared bankrupt on 9 November 2007, but managed to sell the airport and make a recovery. In July 2009 the manufacturing of the Allegro was moved to Roseburg, Oregon, USA, as part of X-Air Australia. The move was attributed to the high value of the Euro reducing sales to the USA and Australia."

Buying a membership gains access to a fleet of boats that are shared among the members of the club. The fleet consists of a variety of boats such as bow riders, cruisers, deck boats and fishing boats. Members aren’t limited to the same boat – or the same type of boat – each time they go on the water. On-the-water boat safety classes are offered by Freedom Boat Club to ensure that members are comfortable and safe. In Northeast Florida, realtors have used Freedom Boat Club to attract home buyers by bundling a membership with property that doesn't already have access to the water."

Francis Foy later sold his half share of the business to Gibson and moved to Sydney, establishing Mark Foy's there. Gibson established a branch of the business in Perth in 1895, and subsequently opened a store in Brisbane in 1903 and another in Rundle Street, Adelaide in 1907. In 1955, the company was bought out by Cox Brothers and in 1964, Foy & Gibson (WA) Ltd, including ten stores in Western Australia, was sold to David Jones. The Bourke Street Melbourne store was sold to Woolworths in 1967.The Adelaide store continued to trade under the Cox-Foys banner - owned by Harris Scarfe until it closed in 1977."

  "text" : "Fording Canadian Coal Trust (NYSE: FDG; TSX:FDG) was a Canadian-based royalty trust which owned a 60% stake in the Elk Valley Coal Partnership (EVCP), which in turn produced hard-coking metallurgical coal, primarily for steel production, at its facility in Elk Valley, British Columbia. Through the EVCP it also owned a 46% interest in Neptune Bulk Terminals (Canada) Ltd., which operates a dedicated coal berth at the Port of Vancouver. Its market capitalization was $11-billion USD in 2008. The trust was formed in 2003 to assemble various assets from Luscar Ltd./CONSOL Energy Canada Ltd. joint ventures, Teck Cominco Ltd., and the former Fording Coal Ltd. (which was originally a unit of Canadian Pacific Railway until October 2001). On July 29, 2008, Teck Cominco announced an agreement with Fording to purchase 100% of its assets; Teck Cominco had been the minority owner of the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, with a 40% stake. The purchase was closed on October 30, 2008, with a final cost of $14-billion USD to Teck. Elk Valley Coal Corporation will be renamed Teck Coal Limited."

Follett milestones include: \n*  1948 - Founded by Roy Follett in Garden City, New York \n*  1954 - Don Follett took over the company \n*  1967 - A new manufacturing plant opened in Easton, Pennsylvania \n*  1994 - Steve Follett, Roy Follet's grandson, assumed the CEO role \n*  2005 - A new manufacturing facility opens in Gdansk, Poland \n*  2015 - A new manufacturing facility opens in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Today, Follett Corporation still builds ice storage and transport systems, ice and water dispensers, ice and beverage dispensers, and medical-grade refrigerators and freezers for foodservice and healthcare markets. Follett products can be found in hospitals, restaurants, Major League Baseball stadiums and casinos around the country, as well as in the Beijing Winter Olympics stadium."

In addition to owning the Red Sox and Liverpool F.C., the Boston-based limited liability company also owns the home stadiums for both teams (Fenway Park and Anfield) and Fenway Sports Management (which in turn owns the Salem Red Sox of the Class A Carolina League, a minor league baseball franchise), plus 80% of the New England Sports Network (NESN) and 50% of Roush Fenway Racing, with cars entered (current as of 2015 season) in the NASCAR Sprint Cup, NASCAR Xfinity and IMSA Sports Car racing competitions.

  "text" : "Flyscooters was an American company that marketed gas-powered motor scooters manufactured in China and Taiwan. The company was founded in 2006 in Florida by scooter enthusiasts Leon Li and Daniel Pak, and ceased operations in 2010. During the operating life of the company, Flyscooters' basic business model was to import low-cost scooters from abroad (mostly China) and distribute them (under the Fly brand name) to a network of retail scooter dealerships across the USA, providing dealers with warranty and spare parts support. Although Chinese-made scooters did not have a very good reputation for quality at the time, by working directly with the manufacturers, Flyscooters improved the quality of their scooters to a level that was at least minimally satisfactory to the American consumer. Flyscooters' main marketing focus was the Internet, although the company did attend many scooter-based events and industry trade shows, and promoted their brand through such PR initiatives as providing scooters to TV shows and celebrities. The severe economic downturn of 2008-2009 slowed sales of scooters to the point where, despite having an established brand name, a loyal dealer network, competitively-low retail prices, and a reputation for providing good product support, the company could no longer stay in operation. Flyscooters closed in late 2010."

The company launched a German-style wheat beer in the Northern California area on July 27, 2008. The process that the company used to extract yeast from amber is similar to the process described in the fictional book Jurassic Park that was used to retrieve dinosaur blood from mosquitos trapped in amber.

  "text" : "Fixstars Solutions, Inc is a software and services company specializing in multi-core processors, particularly in Nvidia's GPU and CUDA environment, IBM Power7 and Cell. During the early part of 2010, Fixstars developed a strong relationship with Nvidia and focused its linux distribution for GPU computing. Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for CUDA is the first enterprise Linux OS optimized for GPU computing. It offers end users, developers and integrators a faster, more reliable, and less complex GPU computing experience. On November 11, 2008, Japanese company Fixstars announced that it had acquired substantially all of Terra Soft's assets. Terra Soft's former founder and CEO Kai Staats was appointed as COO of Fixstars's new American subsidiary, Fixstars Solutions, which is based in San Jose, California, while retaining Terra Soft's product line, staff and regional offices in Loveland, Colorado. Terra Soft provided software and services for the Power Architecture and Linux OS platform. Former Terra Soft Solutions produced Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) and Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux which included cluster construction tools. Customers included Argonne, Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National Labs, several Department of Defense contractors including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and SAIC; the U.S. Airforce, Navy, Army, and NASA; and many of the top universities around the world including California Institute of Technology, MIT, and Stanford University. As an Apple value-added reseller and IBM Business Partner, Terra Soft Solutions provided turnkey and build-to-order desktop workstations, servers, and High Performance Computing clusters. Terra Soft made their Yellow Dog Linux distribution solely for Power Architecture, optimizing the distributions for AltiVec and the Cell. Terra Soft was the first to support a variety of Apple computers with Linux pre-installed (under a unique license with Apple). When Apple abandoned PowerPC CPUs in favor of the Intel Core chips, Terra Soft was able to concentrate on high-performance computing and the Cell Broadband Engine, working closely with IBM and Sony for the PlayStation 3 products. In 2006, Terra Soft was contracted by Sony to provide a Linux operating system for the PlayStation 3, used by several University researchers as an inexpensive, powerful cluster compute node. Today, Fixstars of Tokyo, Japan carries forward the Yellow Dog Linux and Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux product line with primary focus on heterogeneous, multi-core CPUs such as the Cell Broadband Engine and Nvidia GPU."

Important services from Freeview include its free-to-air channels with an enhanced EPG (electronic program guide) across all channels. Freeview also certifies televisions, set-top boxes and personal video recorders (PVR) which meet its standards. The Freeview brand was launched in November 2008 with teaser commercials promising 15 channels in 2009. The first new \"Freeview\" channel started on 26 March 2009 with Network Ten's One sports channel. Further advertising began on 26 April 2009, with the first Freeview certified devices appearing in retailers from May 2009. In June 2010, the second phase of devices, marked as \"Freeview EPG\" devices, became available in retail stores, designed to work with the newly launched interactive EPG built on MHEG-5. This Freeview EPG will cease operating on November 24, 2017, and Freeview is now focusing on its new Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) FreeviewPlus service which was launched in 2014 and incorporates an onscreen guide."

  "text" : "FatKat, Inc. is a privately held company founded in 1999 by Raymond C. Kurzweil, an author, inventor, and futurist. He’s perhaps best known for creating an optical character recognition system that – in conjunction with a flatbed scanner and text-to-speech synthesizer – reads text aloud to the sight-impaired. FatKat is an acronym derived from “Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies.” The aforesaid company is one of a total of nine Kurzweil companies. The purpose of FatKat as listed with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Corporations Division is “investment software.” Kurzweil, who specializes in artificial intelligence coupled with pattern recognition, has created software that uses quantitative methods to pick stocks for investment purposes. Although selecting stocks based on software-generated recommendations is not new, FatKat’s approach was unique at the time because of its “nonlinear decision making processes more akin to how a brain operates.” In layman's terms, the software can evolve by creating different rules, letting them compete, and using (or combining) the best outcomes. After FatKat’s inception, other investment and/or software companies rushed to develop software based on this and similar Darwinist evolutionary principles, using genetic algorithms. In 2005, Kurzweil reported that the FatKat software was “doing very well – 50% to 100% returns for the last two years.”  But as of December 2008, FatKat does not offer its software for sale."

Since inception, the firm has raised three private equity funds. Fenway's first fund, closed on approximately $525 million of capital commitments in 1996 and just two years later, in 1998, the firm raised an additional $900 million of capital. As a result of several investments made in the 1998 fund, prior to the collapse of the dot-com bubble, performance in that fund was affected. Nevertheless, the firm was able to raise a successor fund in 2006 and 2007 with approximately $700 million of commitments from institutional investors."

The flagship store remains at Broadway and West 74th Street, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Sterling Investment Partners, a private equity firm in Westport, Connecticut, bought a controlling stake in Fairway Market in January 2007 and committed to substantially expanding the chain in the Greater New York area. Sterling made a $150 million capital investment in Fairway and has thus far committed to over $100 million for Fairway’s expansion, enabling the enterprise to grow rapidly and generating 2,100 new jobs in the tri-state area within the ensuing 3 1/2 years. In 2011, the chain had revenues of $550 million. It was spun off in an IPO on April 17, 2013, trading under its parent, Fairway Group Holdings Corp., on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \"FWM\". On May 2, 2016, Fairway Markets filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after having lost money every quarter since it went public"

Its main competitors are Woolworths, Coles, Bi-Lo, IGA, and Aldi. It is Australia's second largest leading independent supermarket retailing group, supporting in excess of $1.35 billion in annual sales at the retail level. Retail groups that were part of the merger include AUR, Foodstore, FoodWorks, Buy Rite, Cut Price, 727, Rite-Way, Banana Joe's, Food-Rite, Tuckerbag and Food-Way. The AURL has currently over 600 supermarkets, food and convenience stores spanning seven states / territories nationally with over 400 of these operating under the FoodWorks brand. FoodWorks has some similarities to IGA, the brand's closest competitor. They have similar ancestry, both being created from independent retail stores merging to create supermarket groups. Also, both comprise multiple individual retailers originally trading under some of the same independent chains. In addition, IGA's main \"home brand\" is Black and Gold, a generic food brand which also sells in FoodWorks stores across the country. Items are easily distinguished because of the gold/yellow packaging with the black writing on the item."

  "text" : "FanSnap was an online search engine for live event tickets, based in Palo Alto, California. Founded in 2007, FanSnap aggregated event-level ticket data from event ticket providers. FanSnap's search engine combined results from ticket issuers and various providers in the ticket resale industry including ticket resale marketplaces such as RazorGator, StubHub, TicketNetwork and eBay, as well as ticket brokers including Ace Ticket, AllShows.com, Barry's Tickets, Gold Coast Tickets and Las Vegas Tickets. FanSnap did not sell tickets directly to its end-users. Instead, it aggregated event-level ticket data from ticket providers, presented that data in response to user searches and directed users to third-party ticket providers for purchase. FanSnap generated revenue through cost per click and cost per action advertising based upon its referral of users to such third-party ticket providers. FanSnap's founders possessed experience from the live event ticketing and online search industries and have previously worked at StubHub, Apple Inc., MTV and NexTag. FanSnap raised $15.7 million in start-up capital from General Catalyst Partners of Cambridge, Massachusetts, amongst other investors. FanSnap was acquired by NexTag in December 2011. FanSnap was then acquired from Nextag/Wize Commerce by rival ticket search engine SeatGeek in November 2013 for an undisclosed sum. As part of the acquisition, the main FanSnap ticket search engine was discontinued and rolled into SeatGeek's existing ticket search offerings."

  "text" : "Firehole Composites (Formerly Firehole Technologies, Inc.) is a supplier of computer-aided engineering (CAE) software and consulting services specializing in analysis of composite materials. Founded in 2000, the company's mission is to provide enabling technologies to further the widespread use of composite materials. Their products include Helius:MCT (a multiscale simulation tool for composite progressive failure analysis), Helius:CompositePro (a classical laminate theory and simple structural analysis tool), Helius:MatSim (an online micromechanics lamina simulator), and Prospector:Composites (an online composite material properties database hosted by IDES Inc.). Firehole’s principal product, Helius:MCT, is a simulation tool built to improve the accuracy of composite structure analysis and is available as an advanced capability add-on to commercial finite element analysis (FEA) packages (such as Abaqus and ANSYS). It is based on Multicontinuum Technology (MCT), an analysis methodology developed specifically for composites which, rather than treating the composite as a homogeneous material, extracts the separate stress and strain fields for the constituents (fiber and matrix) of a composite material. In doing so, distinct failure criteria and material nonlinearity can be applied separately. This permits Helius:MCT to identify failure of individual material constituents and degrade a composite material accordingly, providing a robust progressive failure simulation that captures failure initiation all the way up to and beyond ultimate structural failure."

  "text" : "The Flanders Automobile Company was a short-lived US-American automobile manufacturer which operated in Detroit, Michigan, from 1910 to 1913. It was the brainchild of Walter E. Flanders (1871–1923), who formerly held a position as General Factory Manager at the Ford Motor Company's Piquette avenue plant. There he co-invented the ingenious manufacturing methods which made the Model T Ford so famous. In 1908, Flanders left the Ford Motor Company and co-founded, together with Bernard F. Everitt and William Metzger, the E-M-F Automobile Company in Detroit. This car, based on Flander's experience with the Model T Ford was the first mass-produced Flanders car. At the beginning, there were two offerings, model \"30\" and model \"20\". The \"30\", although prone to many faults, became a huge success but failed to outsell the Model T Ford. Although second in its best year, it was beaten by the Model T with a wide margin. In this situation, Flanders convinced the Studebaker brothers, who held substantial stock in E-M-F and were its sole distributor in the USA, to buy the defunct factory of the DeLux Motor Company in Detroit, and to build there a new challenger to Ford. So, E-M-F dropped the \"20\", concentrating on their model \"30\". The new Flanders, appropriately named model \"20\", was patterned after this smaller E-M-F."

  "text" : "Fantic Motor is an Italian manufacturer of motorcycles. The company began in 1968, manufacturing and exporting enduro motorcycles, mini-bikes and go-karts. Today they continue in the same genre, though the names have changed to dual-sport and motard (supermoto), and they have not returned to the US market. Fantic began exporting to the United Kingdom in 1972, as part of a wave of manufacturers who took advantage of \"sixteener laws,\" legislation that forbade sixteen-year-old motorcyclists from riding motorcycles up to 250 cc, as they had been used to. As a result, European and Japananese manufacturers exported their sporty and lightweight below-50cc engines, which had been common in Europe, to England also. Fantic produced a \"sensational chopper moped\" and a TI (\"Tourismo Internazionale),\" both of which became very popular quickly, with the reputation of being some of the fastest mopeds on the market, going as fast as 70 mph. In the 1980s, Fantic enjoyed success in the Observed trials world championships, taking three titles as well as seven wins at the prestigious Scottish Six Days Trial."

In 1954, he moved his bakery from a laneway address to a two-storey cottage on Fairmount Avenue, building a large wood fire oven on the first floor, while his family lived upstairs. Fairmount Bagel is often referred to as the original Montreal bagel bakery. The bakery is still family owned and competes with nearby St-Viateur Bagel for the title of Montreal's best bagel. In June 2008, Montreal-born astronaut Gregory Chamitoff, who is related to the Shlafman family, brought Fairmount bagels with him aboard the International Space Station."

The service became very successful as at the time texting was expensive. Later the portal grew to include other mobile services (games, ring tones, icons, etc.). The social network grew out of experimental \"friends\" feature of the website. The company also developed video sharing websites Videogaga.lt and Videogaga.lv. Both projects are closed at this moment. In 2007, Forticom bought 25% of Russian Odnoklassniki. In June 2008, the company acquired 70% interest in Polish Nasza-klasa.pl for $92 million. Both websites are designed for former classmates. All the Forticom's stocks of Nasza-klasa.pl were sold.At this moment company is developing project called Odnoklassniki.ru."

The cruise line operated only one ship, the Fiesta Marina. The ship was named in Miami, Florida on October 18, 1993. The cruise line was a total marketing failure and was dissolved in September 1994. The Fiesta Marina was sold to Epirotiki Cruises to sail as the Olympic. In 2007, the Carnival Corporation started a joint-partnership with the Orizonia Corporación to start a new cruise line called Iberocruceros. Just like Fiesta Marina, the new cruise line was marketed toward the Latin/Spanish-speaking population. The cruise line operated out of South America and Europe, independently from Carnival, but was managed by Costa Cruises. Iberocruceros was closed in 2014 and its ships transferred to Costa or elsewhere."

It was founded in 1918 in Detroit, after August Fruehauf created the semi-trailer and launched a new industry. The Fruehauf trailer company introduced revolutionary inventions to trucking and transportation with hydraulic dump trailers, bulk tanker trailers, and automatic fifth wheel coupling among their over one thousand patents, including the shipping container in 1956. Expanding across the country, Fruehauf had 16 plants and over 80 distributorships for parts and service. Globally, the company expanded into Europe, South America and Asia. Following a proxy battle in the late 1980s the company filed for bankrupt protection in 1997. International divisions became independent, U.S. subsidiaries like Kelsey Hayes, Pro-Par, Budd Wheels and Hobbs were sold; Wabash National acquired the crippled company in 1997."

  "text" : "First House is a Norwegian strategic advisory, corporate communications, governmental affairs and crisis management/issue management agency. First House, with 27 senior advisers and 9 associate partners, started its operation Monday 4 January 2010. It was founded by former head of global corporate communication in Glitnir, Islandsbanki, and communications adviser in Sparebank1 Bjørn Richard Johansen. The firm is located with office in Oslo in Norway. Managing partner is Per Høiby, brother of Crown Princess Mette-Marit. Partner Leif Monsen is Chair of the board in First House. Key partners and cofounders include, minister of three different ministries including the Ministry of Health and Care Services, Bjarne Håkon Hanssen and state secretary Ketil Lindseth. Several of the firms advisers, including Bjarne Håkon Hanssen had 6 months quarantine before they could join the firm. The founder Bjørn Richard Johansen recruited politicians as partners and co-founders of the firm, something which has been sharply criticized. This led to a debate about the PR-industry and its growing importance in Norway. Notable former politicians and political advisers that work for the company include Morten Andreas Meyer, (Høyre, The Conservative party), Tor Mikkel Wara (Fremskrittspartiet/The Progressive party), Morten Wetland (Arbeiderpartiet/Labour) and Erlend Fuglum (Senterpartiet/The Centre party). Former notable journalists include news editor in VG (VG, Schibsted) for several years Hans-Christian Vadseth, NRK reporter for more than 40 years Geir Helljesen and Einar Lunde  People. Morten Wetland joined the firm in 2013 from the position as Norway´s UN ambassador. Wetland also served as the Norwegian ambassador to Germany. A similar group of senior advisers with background from industry and finance are working at the firm: Geir Arne Drangeid worked with Aker for 22 years, including many years as a key member of the leadership team of the successful Norwegian tycoon Kjell Inge Røkke. He leads the firms focus on the finance sector and private equity including M&A, IPOs and legislation advisory. Key members in this unit include Leif Monsen, Kari Holm Hejna and Andreas Nyheim. Nyheim joined First House from Norway´s business daily Dagens Næringsliv in 2013. The firm won the award as Consultancy of the year 2014 in Norway by Konsulentguiden. First House also received the award as SABRE Newcomer of the year by Holmes Report in May 2012 and was nominated as SABRE Financial consultancy of the year in May 2013. Minister of Agriculture and Food in the current Conservative/Progressive Erna Solberg government in Norway, Sylvi Listhaug, worked with First House until she stepped down to join the ministerial position in October 2013. Dean of the Marketing college (Markedshøyskolen) Trond Blindheim has referred to First House as the company with \"the most expansive and clever lobbyists\". On 19 June 2013 Dagbladet said that the company commenting on the Norwegian parliamentary election 2013 for TV2, is a conflict of interest."

  "text" : "Franco-Nevada Corporation is a Toronto, Canada-based company that owns royalties and streams in gold mining and other commodity and natural resource investments. It is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. The 'Old Franco-Nevada' was a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange from 1983 to 2002. In 1986, Old Franco-Nevada made its first royalty acquisition, and acquired or created additional royalties and resource investments from 1986 to 2002. Following several royalty acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s, Old Franco-Nevada sold its only mining property to Normandy Mining in exchange for 19.9% of the company's shares. In 2002, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco-Nevada as part of a three-way combination of Newmont, Normandy and Old Franco-Nevada. Newmont maintained Franco-Nevada as a royalty holding division, transferring numerous other royalties to it over the five-year period following the acquisition, building its portfolio of royalties to include investments in almost 300 royalies (two-thirds in bases and precious metal miners, and one-third in oil and natural gas). In 2007 Newmont spun off Franco-Nevada in an Initial Public Offering."

Since 2004 the festival's attendance and public recognition has grown each year as new film makers and artists have attended. In 2009 three hundred people were estimated to be in attendance. Flim Fest has a free submission policy where all materials submitted to the festival require no fees to be considered for the screening. The festival's title has often been the butt of many jokes questioning the grammatic skills of the festival's organizers."

  "text" : "Formstack is an online form builder that enables users to create any type of online form, including surveys, contact forms, event registrations and order forms. Users can then integrate the forms into their websites and begin collecting data. The application allows for organizations to create the forms without any programming, software or special skills required. Founded in 2006, the company is privately held and headquartered in Indianapolis, IN. In November 2009, Formstack (then called FormSpring) launched formspring.me, a social question and answer site where users can ask questions, give answers, and learn more about their friends. Because of the success of the site, formspring.me was spun out as a separate company in January 2010 with a different team and different resources. To allow both companies to continue their growth, FormSpring.com became Formstack.com to avoid any confusion with formspring.me."

  "text" : "Finolex Group is a private sector conglomerate based in Pune, India. The Finolex Group comprises Finolex Cables Ltd., Finolex Industries Ltd., Finolex J-Power Systems Ltd. and Finolex Plasson Industries Ltd. In July 1945, two young brothers P.P Chhabria and K.P Chhabria came to Pune from Karachi in search of a livelihood and within six months set up a small shop selling electrical cables. The retail business became quite successful. A sizable order in the mid 1950s from the Defence Department for wire harnesses for trucks and tanks bolstered their confidence and they decided to manufacture Cables, themselves. Starting as a small-scale industrial unit in 1956, they manufactured PVC insulated cables for the automobile industry. Finolex brand was born from \"Fine\" & \"Flexibles\" and \"O\" with an electric arc across it - signifying the electrical cable business the company was in. Their relentless search for growth and doughty perseverance saw them through some difficult times and in 1972 the enterprise turned into a limited company. Since then, there has been no looking back and following a public offering in July 1983, Finolex Cables Limited embarked on a continuous process of expansion and modernization which enabled it to become the most diversified & largest cable manufacturer in the country. Their relentless quest for growth saw the brothers establishing Finolex Industries Limited (FIL) in 1981. The company sought to manufacture Rigid PVC Pipes and Fittings at Pune, which find large-scale application in the agriculture sector. In a shrewd move towards backwards integration, the company has set up a PVC resin manufacturing facility at Ratnagiri on the west coast of India. The early nineties saw the Finolex Group expanding into new business domains to manufacture Optic Fibre Cables and Copper Rods. Today the Group turnover exceeds Rs. 30 Billion (about US$750 million) Finolex Cables Ltd (FCL) and Finolex Industries Ltd (FIL) are the two group companies whose equity shares are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. Global Depository Receipts of Finolex Cables Limited are also listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Professionally managed, with continuous updating of technology and strict quality controls, Finolex strives for maximum customer satisfaction. Over the years, it has attained a significant position on the industrial map of India."

  "text" : "Located in Montgomery, Alabama, the Foundation for Moral Law is a 501(c)(3) corporation operating as a non-profit organization with a mission to protect individual religious liberties rights contemplated in the United States Constitution. According to the Foundation's website, it participates in two main functions. First, it provides legal representation for people involved in situations concerning religious liberties, such as those who believe that creationism should be taught in public schools and those who believe that the U.S. military ban on homosexuality was constitutional. The Foundation also publishes amici curiae court briefs in advocating these rights. A second pursuit of the organization is to educate lawyers and non-lawyers of what the Foundation perceive as a significant need to acknowledge God, in both law and government. Pastor Phillip Ellen was the first President The Foundation for Moral Law in December 2002. Randy Stafford acted as Vice-President at that time, and Mel C. Glenn Sr., as Executive Director. In November 2003, the board chose Rich Hobson as president of the Foundation, and Ellen became vice-president. Later, Judge Roy Moore served as the President of the Foundation, and Hobson served as Executive Director. In January 2013 it was announced Moore's wife, Kayla Moore, would serve as President of the Foundation. The organization says that it exists \"to restore the knowledge of God in law and government and to acknowledge and defend the truth that man is endowed with rights, not by our fellow man, but by God!\""

The diner was split lengthwise and originally shipped to Paoli, Pennsylvania and operated as the Paoli Diner. Originally manufactured in 1935 (though some sites reference 1929), it was purchased by Frances and Sylvester Cavalati in 1957 and moved to its present location at 189 Lancaster Avenue, Frazer, PA 19355 in East Whiteland Township. In 1972, while retaining ownership, they leased it to others to operate and the name was changed to the Frazer Diner. Around 1983, the diner was leased to Tam Nguyen and his wife Hao (law school graduate and nurse, respectively) who had fled communism in Vietnam and moved to the Main Line in 1980. They operated it as the Linh Diner, specializing in Vietnamese-Chinese food, and it became a regular lunch stop for nearby high-tech companies in the Great Valley. After five years building a successful business, they were running out of space and looking to move to a new location that was to be built as part of a new shopping center nearby. Before that happened, the Cavalati's served the Nguyens an eviction notice, and noted there was a buyer who wanted to move the diner to Hollywood. The Nguyens did eventually open the Linh Reastaurant nearby, but the diner was not moved to California, and eventually re-opened, once again as the Frazer Diner."

  "text" : "Fiat Industrial S.p.A. was an Italian company into which Fiat S.p.A. (parent company of Fiat Group) demerged most of its activities not directly related to automobiles at the start of 2011. Fiat Industrial served as a holding company for the activities of truck manufacturer Iveco; an 89.3% stake in the agricultural and construction equipment producer CNH Global; and FPT Industrial, which consists of the industrial and marine activities formerly part of Fiat Powertrain Technologies. The company's Chairman was Sergio Marchionne, who also served as CEO of Fiat S.p.A. and Chairman/CEO of Chrysler Group LLC, now merged as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. On 1 January 2011, each existing share of Fiat S.p.A. was converted into one Fiat share and one Fiat Industrial share. This resulted in Exor (the holding company controlled by the Agnelli family), the largest shareholder of Fiat with a stake of around 30%, holding an equivalent stake in Fiat Industrial. Exor has however raised the possibility of the future sale of some of its stake. In September 2011, the company entered the DJSI World and Europe indexes as leader in the Industrial Engineering sector. On 29 September 2013, CNH Global N.V. and Fiat Industrial S.p.A. were merged into CNH Industrial N.V., a company incorporated in the Netherlands. Fiat Industrial shareholders received one CNH Industrial common share for every Fiat Industrial share held and CNH Global shareholders received 3.828 CNH Industrial common shares for every CNH Global common share held. CNH Industrial N.V. was subsequently listed on both the NYSE and the Milan stock exchange (Mercato Telematico Azionario. For additional information, see CNH Industrial N.V."

  "text" : "Fluidic Energy is a for-profit corporation based in Scottsdale, Arizona that focuses on the development of energy storage solutions, based on its proprietary metal-air battery technology and integrated intelligence. The company is distributing its systems worldwide for long duration energy storage applications from rural electrification to critical backup power and has strong ties throughout the US, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In March 2015 the Company signed a deal with Caterpillar, which included an equity investment in Fluidic Energy as well as a commercial agreement to collaborate in the microgrid and telecommunications markets. Over the following year, the company announced two separate MOUs for some of the largest renewable-energy rural electrification projects of their kind.  The Company is dedicating its operations to “paving the path for the smart, sustainable grid of the future.” The company is selling its systems to large blue-chip customers as a replacement for diesel generators or lead acid batteries in markets where the electricity grid is unreliable or remote areas without electricity access. In current applications, Fluidic is claiming significant advantages over traditional batteries. These advantages include safe systems with longer life, lower costs, higher temperature ranges and deeper depth of discharge capability. It appears the company is the first to integrate intelligence into the cell level of the battery system creating a new standard for the definition of a “smart battery.”"

Among others, their portfolio includes the sci-fi shooter Galaxy on Fire 2, the racing simulation Rally Master Pro and the arcade game Waterslide 2. The company, which has won the renowned German Game Developer Award for the \"Best Studio 2011\" and currently takes the 14th place in Develop100's list of The World's Best Game Studios, employs the use of its own Abyss® engine in the creation of its titles. In addition to their original IPs, Fishlabs has also produced a number of ad-games for international clients such as Barclaycard, Volkswagen and Mazda. Their arcade game Waterslide Extreme is one the iPhone’s most successful ad-games with 13 million downloads. Fishlabs was acquired by Koch Media in November 2013 and added to the Planegg-based company's premium game label Deep Silver in December 2013, changing its legal name to Deep Silver FISHLABS but continuing to do business under its old moniker. The development of Fishlabs' most recent projects, a mobile strategy MMO called Galaxy on Fire - Alliances and a hitherto untitled space action shooter set in the Galaxy on Fire universe, continues under the new ownership."

As the increased purchasing power in their home country Portugal made automobile more and more popular, the moped market became smaller and the strong competition from European and Japanese imported models forced the bankruptcy. Their last product was the world's first electric scooter, developed in 1993. FAMEL Electric or Electron, totally produced with Portuguese technology in partnership with EFACEC.

  "text" : "Foncière des Régions (pronounced: [fɔ̃.sjɛʁ dɛ ʁe.ʒjɔ̃]) is a holding company of real estate investment (REIT) companies that own residential and commercial properties in 8 countries (mostly Europe). Its business comes from the rental and leasing of properties (including hotels and car lots) over 70% of which is office space in France and Italy (in 2009 vacancy rates were at 5.3% in France, in other major markets like Rome, Italy rental income was lower because office space use was halved). Its biggest clients are major companies the largest of which is France Telecom which rented half of Fonciere's office space in France (about 1 million m2 (though its share of rental income was 51% in 2009 compared to 60% in 2008). Other major customers are Telecom Italia and Electricite de France and IBM. The company has a 15% interest in France's biggest business park developer, Altarea SCA. Most properties are under its control however there are also about 60 properties that it has a minor stake in (interests in them range from 25 to 38 percent). Widely recognized properties include one of France's tallest skyscrapers Tour Gan (also known as CB21) and Carré Suffren in Paris. Other assets include parking lots (Parcs GFR), retirement homes, warehouses (Fonciere Europe Logistique SCA, Fonciere Developpement Logements SA) hotels, medical facilities, and business parks (15% of France's largest developer Altarea SA). \n* In August 2010 in a joint venture with France's largest bank Credit Agricole, it acquired 48 European hotels from hospitality company Accor. The deal was worth 367 million euro. \n* After acquiring 35% of Italian real estate company Beni Stabili (public on the Milan stock exchange since 1999) from Italian company Delfin (Delfin and Batipart are Fonciere's largest shareholders) it purchased the rest of it in 2007. It was Fonciere's single largest investment in Italy bringing its asset portfolio there to €4 billion. Altogether the company had a market value of between €3.5 and €3.9 billion in 2010."

So it was the most expensive plant of the Ford concern in Western Europe at this time. The company existed from 1997 up to 2000 when it was closed due to low sales. The Ford Union was not a manufacturer, it was only an assembler of SKD kits. The vehicles assembled by the Belarusian plant can be identified by the manufacturer code Y4F on the start on the VIN and an R on the eleventh position for the plant identification. The plant become well-known on 23 July 1997 as president Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko was invited to a press conference with five strategically selected foreign journalists to discuss a predicted failure which later proved true."

  "text" : "Fastpoint Games was a developer of data-driven games for businesses in the fortune 500, and was the parent company of fantasy sports developer, RotoHog. Under the Fastpoint Games banner, the company had applied RotoHog's configurable game platform to use structured data to drive consumer engagement and help brands in markets like social media, entertainment, MMO, politics and regulated gaming to grow their audience, engage their users and monetize them. On 7 January 2011, Fastpoint Games and Sony Online Entertainment announced the alpha launch of the Facebook game Fortune League. The casual strategy game is based on the world of EverQuest II (EQII). In Fortune League, players assess quests, hero performance, situational threats and the actions of other players in a live trade market and compensates leaders with points, cosmetic upgrades and prizes that can be used in the free-to-play and subscription versions of EQII. Fortune League integrates real-time performance data such as damages, deaths and healings directly from the MMO environment and uses them to form Hero Stats that drive the game. Therefore, player actions inside EQII will affect what happens in Fortune League and prizes from Fortune League will help users advance back in the EQII environment. Fastpoint Games CEO, Kelly Perdew, positions Fortune League as a new category of snackable data-driven games that will help MMO franchises acquire users and tap new revenue streams. Between September 2009 and November 2010, the company has leveraged its technology platform to power games outside of the fantasy sports segment and launched games in the entertainment and casual games space. They have partnered with social media platforms including hi5, Facebook and MySpace, and released 58 games for 16 clients across 21 sports and entertainment seasons for marquee clients including US Weekly, NASCAR, ABC, Los Angeles Times, Go Daddy.com and Sports Illustrated online."

  "text" : "Friars Aylesbury is a music club that runs in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England. It has 90,000 members and is believed to be amongst the largest music clubs in Europe. It opened in 1969 but closed down twice, once in 1970 for a period of nine months and again in 1984 for a period of twenty five years. Friars Aylesbury reopened in June 2009 to tie in with its fortieth anniversary. Friars Aylesbury ran as a music club in the market town of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire between 1969 and 1984 in three distinct phases denoted by the venue in the town. Over these fifteen years, there were various trials and tribulations which saw Friars teeter on the edge more than once but it pulled through and presented the best artists of its day and is acknowledged as being heavily responsible for the subsequent success of such artists as David Bowie, Genesis, Wishbone Ash, Mott the Hoople, Cockney Rebel, Sailor, Stackridge, Stiff Little Fingers and more.Fans and artists loved the club, not least because of the atmosphere and the fact they were treated well by people who were genuine music enthusiasts."

  "text" : "The Ford Motor Company (commonly referred to simply as Ford) is an American multinational automaker headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer, Troller, and Australian performance car manufacturer FPV. In the past it has also produced tractors and automotive components. Ford owns a 2.1% stake in Mazda of Japan, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom, and a 49% stake in Jiangling of China. It also has a number of joint-ventures, one in China (Changan Ford Mazda), one in Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), one in Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), one in Turkey (Ford Otosan), and one in Russia (Ford Sollers). It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family, although they have minority ownership (but majority of the voting power). Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914 these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938. During the financial crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, it was close to bankruptcy, but it has since returned to profitability. Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (preceded by General Motors) and the fifth-largest in the world based on 2010 vehicle sales. At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe. Ford is the eighth-ranked overall American-based company in the 2010 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2009 of $118.3 billion. In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide. The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent voting rights."

  "text" : "Fissler is a company based in Germany that produces cookware items. Fissler’s main products include knives, pots, pans, pressure cookers, accessories and an cooking surface for induction cooking. Fissler’s history dates back to the 19th century with its introduction of the Goulash Cannon, a mobile field kitchen, something like the modern-day food truck. In the 1920s Fissler came out with the first aluminum pans for electric stoves. In the 1950s Fissler introduced the first pressure cooker with a multi-setting control valve and the patented “Thematic” base. Fissler continues to be innovative and is constantly developing new technology and improving upon modern designs. The company has numerous international patents, registered designs, and awards. Today, Fissler’s pots and pans have an all-stove base, meaning that they can be used on any heating surface without warping or degrading. This is especially relevant to the new wave in cooking: induction cooking. Fissler produces the CookStar Induction Pro, an induction cooking surface. Induction cooking uses electromagnetic technology to heat the pots and pans, without being hot to the touch. Induction cooking is more energy efficient than electric or gas stove-tops. The induction cooking surface can be adjusted to specific levels that allows one to cook sauces and dishes which require very precise temperatures. The company produces the world's most expensive pan costing £100,000. Fissler’s two lines of knives are called Profession and Perfection. The Profession line is inspired by Japanese knives and includes knives specific for making sushi. The Perfection knives are stylish and modern. Fissler’s website has great information about the functions of the knives for specific tasks. Fissler also has a line of accessories called “Magic”."

In 2008, the company produced 10,349 freight cars, but its output decreased to 3,377 cars in 2009. During fiscal year 2010, FreightCar America had a profit of $36.52 million on revenue of $141.3 million. In June 2014 the Danville plant brought back over 100 employees with promises of work and being able to retire from the plant. They are set to be laid off indefinitely the end of February 2016."

Pau was chosen based on the Pau Broadband Country initiative, a broadband fiber optic development to cover the whole city. The Foundry School became the training center for Pau Broadband Country initiatives. The Foundry School is the second such initiative. Chris Cantell had previously launched another center in Montreal, Quebec in 1999, from which his partner Frédéric Artru graduated, but they weren't as good as the original. Today, The Foundry School has spun off its methodology to additional locations in Eastern Europe to deploy SigEx Ventures, Inc., developments."

  "text" : "Feronia Inc. is a public company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, in operation since 1911 as a large-scale commercial farmland and plantation operator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”). The Company uses modern agricultural practices to operate and develop its oil palm plantations and arable farming business division. Feronia’s oil palm plantations subsidiary is PHC - fr:Plantations et huileries du Congo. Feronia PHC operates in the Équateur and Orientale Province of DRC and consists of three established plantations together with associated infrastructure. The principal products of Feronia PHC are crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). The CPO and PKO products are transported by barge to the capital city of Kinshasa where they are sold into the local markets with any surplus sold to international markets. The local DRC market currently consists of two refining factories located in Kinshasa which purchase 100% of PHC's production. The refined products which are produced by these factories are sold into the local market in a variety of forms. Commencing operations in 1911 as Huileries du Congo Belge (HCB), later fr:Plantations Lever au Congo, Plantations Lever au Zaire, and ultimately fr:Plantations et huileries du Congo the plantations have been in continuous operation since this time. The operation was started as a division of Unilever and for many years was a key operating subsidiary of the multinational. It later formed the nucleus of the United Africa Company which ultimately came under the control of Unilever. The United Africa Company was the principal supplier to the United Kingdom of several key commodities including palm oil, ground nuts, and cocoa. Each of the plantations are located either adjacent to, or in close proximity to the Congo River. Feronia PHC currently employs approximately 4,000 people making it one of the largest private sector employers in Central Africa. Local and international organizations have recently voiced criticism of Feronia's operations in the DRC, for carrying out what they characterize as a massive land grab, as well as for operating a brutal system of labour exploitation and community harassment and making corrupt payouts to politically-connected individuals in the DRC. Feronia disputes these allegations and says it is making a huge difference to people's lives in one of the World's poorest places."

ForSaleByOwner.com then charged to the owners a listing fee that is directly proportional to the length of the advertisement and the period of time it appears on its Web site. For an additional fee, property owners can have also list their properties on the MLS with a real estate agent affiliated with ForSaleByOwner.com. Interested buyers can use the service to search listed properties for free. However, ForSaleByOwner.com does not represent or negotiate on behalf of either the seller or the buyer. On its Website, a disclaimer clearly states that it is not a real estate agent and is legally prohibited from taking part in the actual sales transaction."

  "text" : "Fashion To Figure is a United States retailer focusing exclusively on women's plus-size clothing and related accessories. The store caters exclusively to women and teenagers sized 12 to 26. The chain is named for a quote by Lena Bryant, founder of the plus-sized women's clothing chain Lane Bryant. Asked in 1950 by a Glamour magazine interviewer about the secret to her success, Bryant responded, \"You should never ask women to conform their figures to fashion, but rather bring fashion to the figure.\" Fashion To Figure was co-founded by brothers Michael and Nicholas Kaplan, two of Lena Bryant's great-grandsons. The Kaplans' father, Steven, had been president of Lane Bryant until its sale to The Limited Inc. in 1982. Previously, Nicholas Kaplan had served as a Saks Fifth Avenue department manager and buyer, general merchandise manager at Bluefly, and co-founder of the Designer Warehouse liquidation chain. Michael Kaplan had served as an analyst at Lazard and had previously co-founded an online shopping community for plus-sized women with RRE Ventures. Having grown up hearing stories about how their widowed great-grandmother supported herself by selling the first maternity and full-figure dresses available to American women, Michael and Nicholas Kaplan have explained in interviews that they were drawn to the opportunity to carry on their family's tradition. The brothers took as the company's mission \"to make people's lives better through the ultimate full-fashion experience.\" Unlike most other plus-sized specialty retailers, Fashion To Figure is not a vertically integrated retailer. With an eye to providing consumers with a wide array of full-fashion options, the company sources its inventory from more than one hundred vendors. The company's CEO, Michael Kaplan, has argued that this allows the company to provide plus-sized consumers with more choices and to react more nimbly to fashion trends, à la fast fashion. Shoppers depend upon the assistance of sales associates, known as \"stylists,\" to select the best colors and cuts for their individual needs. The first Fashion To Figure store opened at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack, New York in October 2004. The second store opened in 2005 at the Livingston Mall in Livingston, New Jersey. By 2011, Fashion To Figure had seven locations in New York and New Jersey. Two additional stores were slated to open in fall 2011. The company launched its online store in 2010, which serves an international customer base."

The company has said that it holds market leadership positions in all of its segments, and has 16,000 associates that generated more than $3.6 billion in net sales in 2012. Fortune Brands Home & Security was created on October 3, 2011 from part of the former Fortune Brands holding company. The spin-off was related to the pre-announced corporate strategy of divesting unrelated product lines to focus on the liquor business. On the day after spinning off FBHS, Fortune Brands renamed itself as Beam Inc. to reflect this new strategy. Beam Inc. was subsequently purchased by Suntory to become its Beam Suntory subsidiary in April, 2014. FBHS is included in the S&P MidCap 400 index. On October 18, 2011, it was announced that Pershing Square Capital Management owned a 15% stake in the company, and considered its stock to be a very attractive investment."

It was initially established in 1992 to provide superannuation benefits to New South Wales government employees, but is now open to anyone eligible to receive superannuation. It is one of Australia's largest superannuation funds, with more than $57 billion (as at 1-July-2016) in funds under management and over 770,000 members. As a not-for-profit fund all profits are returned to members, rather than being for the benefit of shareholders. This has meant that First State Super has been able to keep their fees low over time."

Forsys was listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange in September 2004, and moved up to the Toronto Stock Exchange in October 2006. In July 2005 Forsys acquired a 90% interest in the Valencia uranium deposit in Namibia and in March 2007 raised its position to 100% ownership. Based on prospecting on the property, Forsys filed a technical report estimating Valencia reserves in June 2007.After clearing environmental requirements, in August 2008 the Namibian government granted Forsys a 25 year mining licence for Valencia. In November 2008 George Arthur Forrest attempted to buy Forsys Metals through a subsidiary of his Forrest Group, offering CDN$579m. The company's management supported the offer.The deal foundered in September 2009. Forrest had not been able to find financial backers that would be acceptable to the Canadian Federal government. There was speculation that Forrest had looked for funding to South Korea, or possibly Iran or North Korea.In January 2011 Wikileaks released U.S. diplomatic cables that said Washington and Ottawa were concerned that Forrest might sell the uranium to Iran, which was looking for nuclear fuel, and therefore blocked the deal. In July 2009 Forsys started exploratory drilling for uranium at the 70% owned Namibplaas permit, 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the Valencia project. In August 2010 Forsys finalized an agreement through which Angus Mining (Namibia), another Canadian company, would explore for gold at Forsys’s wholly owned Ondundu Project.In November 2011 Forsys reported a net loss of $971,000 in the third quarter, much the same as the previous year.The company had almost $5 million in working capital.It was acquiring the remaining 30% of the Namibplaas property by issuing new shares and purchase warrants."

  "text" : "Food Donation Connection (FDC), LLC  is a privately owned American company that serves as the liaison between restaurants/food service companies interested in donating surplus food, and local social service agencies that distribute food to people in need. The company’s vision, “Let Nothing Be Wasted”, is a response to the challenge given by Jesus in the Gospel of John (John 6:1-12). Jesus, after providing food to feed over 5,000 people, asked his disciples to gather up the food that was left, so that it would not be wasted. FDC’s objective is to redirect wholesome prepared food to organizations that help the hungry; food that would otherwise be thrown out by food service organizations. The company was founded in 1992 by Bill Reighard, a former restaurant executive. Its operations and Harvest Support call center are located in Knoxville, Tennessee. FDC assists food service companies by developing and implementing Harvest Food Donation Programs, custom-designed to provide an alternative to discarding surplus prepared food. While other organizations focus on the collection and distribution of non-perishable foods, FDC provides an alternative to discarding surplus, wholesome prepared food (such as excess, order errors, and food that is past the restaurant’s conservative shelf life date but is still wholesome). As the industry leader in coordinating prepared food donations, FDC coordinates these donations from client donors such as restaurants, college campuses, airports and hospitals to food rescue agencies across the U.S. and Canada, as well as some overseas locations. FDC supports both donors and agencies using a unique communication and reporting network with a support center, and maintains expertise in operations, food quality and food safety, and tax savings. For its donor partners, FDC sets up and coordinates all aspects of the food donation program, including feasibility testing, development of quality and safe-handling guidelines for processing of donations, linking donor locations to qualified local food rescue organizations, tax valuation and reports for tax purposes, and ongoing program management to ensure proper program implementation. In 2011, FDC coordinated the donation of 35 million pounds of wholesome, prepared surplus food from 248 food service business entities (with 13,880 restaurants or donor locations) to 7,908 local non-profit hunger relief organizations. FDC supports its agency partners by analyzing their current needs and linking them to one or more appropriate food service businesses who provide donations of surplus, perishable, prepared food. This prepared food allows the recipient agency to focus its resources on fulfilling its core mission, as opposed to spending resources on purchasing and preparing food. Food Donation Connection does not compete against non-profits for funding from government and private sources. Instead, FDC funding is derived from a percentage of donor partners' incremental tax savings, that result from the proper donation of surplus food. Donor efforts to properly store and donate surplus food are rewarded by opportunities to become involved in their local communities, build corporate goodwill and employee morale, recognize potential tax savings, and reduce their carbon footprint. FDC recently formed a non-profit organization, the Harvest Support Network (HSN), which assists recipient agencies by providing services that complement the processes in place at these non-profits. Specifically, HSN’s mission is to provide systems and operational support to 501(c)(3) food banks and other charitable entities to allow these organizations to focus their limited resources on their designated non-profit purposes. HSN provides training materials, scheduling and tracking systems, and tools that enable agencies to better match their needs and volunteer interests. These services further improve the ability of non-profits to achieve their individual missions and operate more efficiently."

  "text" : "Facchini Group is an Italian manufacturing company which manufactures and sells worldwide machinery and equipment for the production of various types of fresh and dry pasta (such as ravioli, tortellini and tortelloni), and for the thermal treatment of food products. The company was founded in 1959 by Spartaco Facchini. The company originally produced high-precision equipment for the food industry. With the Spartacos two sons Roberto and Mauro involved in the family business, the staff was expanded and the internal structure modified. The two brothers began selling Facchini Group's production directly to large companies in the food production field, nationally and internationally. In 2006 the company moved to a new facility in Cormano (in the Province of Milan area) to increase capacity of production of single machines. A year later another facility was created in San Pietro in Gu (in the Province of Padua area) to manufacture complete pasta production lines."

Today, it produces both its own \"Studiologic\" brand of MIDI controllers, supplies keyboards for third party manufacturers, and manufactures electronic sustain pedals. In 2008, Fatar released the Numa keyboard controller, which was constructed entirely from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and allowed the user to define their own velocity curves."

  "text" : "Fayve was a digital entertainment distribution service founded and developed by Vulcan Technologies, LLC. It was launched on November 8, 2012, and ran as an app on iOS for iPad owners, on Google Play for Android Tablets and on Amazon for Kindle tablets. The app was a movie and TV show discovery tool that aggregated content from Netflix, Hulu, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, Amazon Instant, Redbox, YouTube, VUDU, Crackle, iTunes, XFINITY, IndieFlix and Fandango into one library. It allowed users with accounts from those service providers to stream content from a single interface. Support for Fayve ended on November 16, 2014, and the app was removed from the app stores after a major streaming provider discontinued its data feed. Fayve was originally created for, and used by, Paul G. Allen, founder of Fayve’s parent company, Vulcan, Inc., to navigate “his own giant collection of films and movies.” It was re-tooled and commercialized because of its “broader market appeal.” According to CNET, the name Fayve is both a reference to “favorites” and a homage to Allen’s mother, Faye, who died in 2012."

  "text" : "Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited is a Public Sector Undertaking in India under the administrative control of the Department of Fertilizers, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. The company began in 1961 when Indian government consolidated several state run fertilizer companies into a single SBU. FCI has manufacturing units in 5 states: Sindri complex (Jharkhand), Gorakhpur complex (Uttar Pradesh), Ramagundam complex (Telangana), Talcher complex (Odisha) and an un-commissioned project in Korba (Chhattisgarh). The organisation was declared \"sick\" in 1992 and in 2002 Government of India initiated actions to close the company. The company has been seeking to restart operations and as of May 2010 had received initial approvals of a government loan forgiveness plan which would allow operations to restart in five of its units. In 1978, FCIL was re-organised and 5 separate entities were formed – FCIL, NFL National Fertilizers, HFCL (Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited), RCF Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers and PDIL Projects and Development India Limited - earlier the technology & development wing known as P & D). In the mid 1990s, FCI employed around 28,000 people and was one of the largest public sector companies in India. Apart from these manufacturing units, there were 9 gypsum producing units under Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited operating through another division known as the Jodhpur Mining Organization - now renamed FAGMIL (FCI Aravali Gypsum and Minerals India Limited). Under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act 1985, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction declared the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited sick in 1992. Within the next decade the Indian government concluded that all fertilizer production units of FCIL except Jodhpur Mining Organization were incurring heavy losses & decided to wind up FCIL. However the main reasons for the loss incurred by FCIL were higher incidence of interest, higher input costs especially the power tariffs by the concerned State Electricity Boards & the associated raw materials,and higher consumption which was not reimbursed by the FICC. The main products of Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited were Ammonia, Urea, Nitric Acid, Ammonium Bicarbonate, Gypsum, and Ammonium Nitrate in varied forms such as Prill, Flake, and Melt. - See more at Revival of the Company: Considering the shortage of domestic production of Urea in meeting the overall demand of Urea in India, Cabinet decided in April 2007 to consider the feasibility of reviving Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited. Subsequently, Cabinet constituted and Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECOS) on 30.10.2008 to consider various options of revival and further approved ‘in principle’ to consider waiver of GoI Loan & Interest, in case of availability of viable fully tied up revival proposal. After detailed study and recommendations for a revival option, ECOS on 24.8.2009 selected a suitable Revival Model and recommended the same for seeking the approval of GoI. Following PSUs & Co-operative have shown interest in the revival of some Units of the Company: a. Talcher Unit: GAIL + RCF + CIL (GAIL: Gas Authority of India Ltd, RCF: Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers, CIL: Coal India) b. Ramagundam Unit: NFL + EIL (NFL: National Fertilizers, EIL: Engineers India) c. Sindri Unit: SAIL + NFL (SAIL: Steel Authority of India, NFL: National Fertilizers) Considering the above, ECOS in their 3rd meeting held on 4.8.2010 recommended permitting revival by these PSUs & Co- operative on nomination basis at reserve values of the bid parameters of the ‘revenue sharing’ model, subject to approval of CCEA.FCIL & DOF are in the process of finalizing a Draft Rehabilitation Scheme (DRS) with the assistance of the Project Advisor, M/s sought on the DRS. The case came up for hearing before the Hon’ble BIFR on 12.11.2010 and on deliberations of the progress made, the Hon’ble Bench advised as under:(i) Appointed State Bank of India as the Operating Agency; (ii) Advised the Company/DoF to obtain the approval of the Cabinet for the proposed Revival Scheme and suggested that the waiver of liabilities of FCIL towards CPSUs and Government agencies through One Time Settlement (OTS) also be taken up.(iii) The next hearing is scheduled for 3 March 2011 for consideration of Revival Scheme approved by the Government."

  "text" : "Falconar Avia is a Canadian aircraft manufacturer based in Edmonton, Alberta. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of kits and plans for amateur construction. Founded in the 1960s by aeronautical engineer Chris Falconar, the company created a new aircraft fabric process called Hipec. The company also acquired a large list of aircraft designs that were either orphaned, like the Fauvel AV.36 glider or long out of production and added their own designs to the line. The company provides plans and kits for all their designs as well as parts and modification kits for other aircraft, including the Ercoupe. In 1963 Falconar partnered with designer Marcel Jurca to produce the Jurca Gnatsum. By 1967, Falconar recommended a large number of changes to the design, which resulted in Jurca leaving the project. The modified aircraft was developed as the Falconar SAL Mustang, first flown in 1971 after significant cost overruns. Falconar Aircraft Ltd was sold to George F. Chivers and other investors and operated as Sturgeon Air Ltd with Falconar as an employee until 1973. In 1985 Falconar established a new Falconar Aviation Ltd. with the assets of A & B Sales and the rights to many Jurca plans. Falconar also carried on operations as president of Hirth engines during this time. In 1994 the company was dissolved following legal disputes and was reestablished in its current form as Falconar Avia Inc. in 1995."

Erehtyneet sydämet was released in April 1944, with Uotila and Eero Leväluoma sharing the director's credits. Later that year, Yrjö Norta directed a film Hiipivä vaara. Norta directed five of Fenno-Filmi's 18 films. Roland af Hällström made his first Fenno-Filmi effort Houkutuslintu in 1946. He soon became the head director for the company, a position which he later kept in Fennada-Filmi as well. Edvin Laine, Jorma Nortimo and Teuvo Tulio were some of the other directors who worked for Fenno-Filmi. The company was not able to produce commercially successful films and suffered from financial problems since the beginning. When Mauno Mäkelä became the head of the company in 1949, efforts were made to merge the productions of Fenno-Filmi and Adams Filmi. This happened in 1950, and the new company was named Fennada-Filmi. The Finnish Broadcasting Company has been holding the rights to the Fenno-Filmi productions since 1982."

It does this by creating companies around commercially opportunistic research and discoveries from the four universities. These companies are grown and then eventually sold (see spin-out companies). Fusion IP is one of a handful of companies that specialise in the commercialisation of university intellectual property within the UK through the sourcing of funding from public markets. The other two notable companies operating the same field are IP Group plc (LSE: IPO) and Imperial Innovations plc (LSE: IVO). Additionally, smaller companies operate within the field of university intellectual property but do not have such a focus on spinning out companies, nor a formal contractual relationship with universities over intellectual property rights. Fusion IP has 20 companies currently within its portfolio. It creates between 2 and 3 new companies each year."

  "text" : "Fulton Beer is a brewery in the North Loop area of Minneapolis, USA. According to the brewery, it was founded in 2009 by friends Ryan Petz, Jim Diley, Brian Hoffman and Peter Grande, who had been homebrewing for several years out of Diley's garage in the Fulton neighborhood of South Minneapolis. The owners cite the American engineer and inventor Robert Fulton as the namesake of the brand. Fulton's signature beer, Sweet Child of Vine IPA, was initially contract brewed at the Sand Creek Brewing Company in Black River Falls, Wisconsin. However, an important distinction in the contract with Sand Creek enabled Fulton to brew on Sand Creek equipment so Fulton could assert that they brewed Fulton beer. In September 2010 the company signed a lease for a former sewing factory located near Downtown Minneapolis to build their own production building. Their brewery formally opened in November 2011 offering tours and growlers. In March 2012 Fulton opened a taproom at their brewery, making them the first brewery in Minneapolis to do so under a revised law. In September 2013, Fulton announced plans to lease a new 51,000 square foot industrial space in Northeast Minneapolis to use as a production space. Brewing began at their new facility in August 2014 and currently most of their product is brewed and packaged in their new facility. They are on track to surpass 25,000 barrels in 2015. Their existing taproom and brewery will remain operational."

Firesprite was founded by Graeme Ankers as Managing Director, Lee Carus as Art Director, Chris Roberts as Technical Director, Stuart Tilley as Game Director and Stuart Lovegrove as Programming Director. The studio is staffed by some developers that were part of the original SCE Studio Liverpool when it was still called Psygnosis and the five people in the studio's core leadership team have worked on games for every PlayStation console. \"The founding team met up socially after Studio Liverpool and we talked about all the things we had achieved over the years, the platform launches, the variety of games, going back to Psygnosis days and through to F1 and Wipeout. We knew we wanted to carry on making great games,\" Ankers told IGN. Psygnosis was acquired by Sony in 1993 then in 2001 renamed to SCE Studio Liverpool and the entity was closed down in 2012. The studio is probably most well known for the Wipeout series. At present, Firesprite is working on tools and an engine for a new unannounced project."

In December 2013, the Freedom Financial Network announced it received a venture capital commitment of $125 million from Vulcan Capital, which is Vulcan Inc.'s investment company. Freedom Financial Network will use the capital to grow its lending operations and to launch FreedomPlus, an online lending platform set to debut in early 2014. FreedomPlus will be open to accredited investors to invest in pools of loans, but it is not a peer to peer lending company. FreedomPlus will be led by Joseph Toms, the former managing director at LC Advisors, Lending Club’s registered investment advisor subsidiary, and Chief Investment Officer at Prosper Marketplace. Both are peer-to-peer lenders. FreedomPlus will focus on “emerging prime” borrowers with FICO scores between 600 and 749, of which there are 80 million in the US. The maximum loan amount will be $35,000 and the maximum interest rate will be less than 36%, with loan terms of two to five years. The company will use traditional underwriting tools, such as credit scores, when underwriting loans. It will also use a significant human component and talk with borrowers to verify information and understand the goals they wish to accomplish with the loan, to try to find loans that fits borrowers' specific needs."

Unsustainable harvesting of potentially vulnerable plant species can endanger local ecosystems as well as the livelihoods of the collectors who often belong to the poorest social groups in the countries of origin. The FairWild Foundation promotes the FairWild Standard and FairWild Certification system for the sustainable management and collection of wild plants. This allows consumers to know they are supporting ethical fair trading standards and for trading benefits to be felt by the local communities harvesting the plants."

A large number of bronze sculptures produced in Florence over the last century come from this artistic foundry. One of the most famous and popular works in Florence, the 'La Fontana del Porcellino', was cast by the Marinelli Foundry in 1988 and replaced the antique in 1998. As early as 1929, Marinelli Foundry was present internationally. It produced the monumental sculpture ‘La Carretta dei Pioneri’ (‘The Pioneer’s Cart’) carved by the Uruguayan artist José Belloni. It may still be seen today in Montevideo. In 1932, the panels of the immense staircase at the entrance of the Vatican Museums by Antonio Maraini were cast. A more recent achievement is the ‘Warrior on horseback’ in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, inaugurated in 2011 and the work of the sculptor Valentina Stevanovska."

  "text" : "Flipora is a personalized content recommendation service that recommends web content to users based on their interests and web activity. Flipora’s machine learning algorithm automatically categorizes the web into thousands of interest categories and provides content to users that suits their identified interests. Users can also follow topics and other like-minded users to receive content recommendations that are further personalized. Flipora users can upvote content recommendations they enjoy and automatically promote those content recommendations to their followers. Flipora had amassed 8 million users by June 2012 and crossed 25 million users worldwide in April 2014. Flipora also has a content recommendation iPhone app. The app allows a user to connect their Facebook and Twitter accounts. The app then uses machine learning to infer a user’s interests based on their Facebook and Twitter activity along with the activity within the app. Finally, the app makes recommendations to users based on topics deemed to be within their sphere of interest. In November 2014, Symantec classified Flipora's Windows software version 2.1.55.0 as a \"low-risk adware\"."

  "text" : "Flair Software was a British video game developer and publisher of the 1990s that developed and published games for the Amiga, Amiga CD32, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and SNES. The developer is mainly associated with popular and colorful Amiga games as Elvira: The Arcade Game, Trolls, Oscar and Whizz. In 1993 platformer Oscar was bundled with Millennium's Diggers as launch bundle for the Amiga CD32 and it was considered as one of the mascot games for the failed system. Flair Software's 1994 fighting game Dangerous Streets (that was a pack-in game for the CD32 later in its lifespan) is generally considered as one of the worst games of all time. At some point Flair Software changed its name into Microvalue and became focused on publishing instead of developing games. The company seems to be defunct, since it hasn't published any games since the end of the 1990s and the current website has been 'under construction' for some years now. The games Trolls and Oscar were remade and re-released in 2010 as Nintendo DSiware by Virtual Playground (that is part of the Microvalue group of companies) under the new titles Oscar in Toyland (since the Trolls license couldn't be used anymore) and Oscar in Movieland. In 2011 Virtual Playground also released two new original Oscar games (Oscar in Toyland 2 and Oscar's World Tour) for DSiware."

  "text" : "The First Women's Bank of California was a local Los Angeles bank dedicated to helping women save money and establish credit. It operated from 1976 until its sale in 1984.The bank was founded by a group of area businesswomen, which included Virginia Mullan, Laura Liswood, Cappy Fogel, Lee Agajanian, Dianne Freestone (Modisett) Kully, and Julann Griffin. Griffin is the former wife of producer/entertainer Merv Griffin, and she was instrumental in convincing celebrities to buy stock in the bank and open accounts. Florence Henderson was the bank's first customer, and eventually Jane Fonda, Loretta Swit, Phyllis Diller, Farrah Fawcett and Anne Bancroft all had accounts there. The bank's mission was expressly feminist. The bank's board of directors believed that many women did not have enough experience with personal finance or the same access to credit as men. The bank therefore focused on helping women manage their money, especially after divorce. Ironically, when the Board first searched for a CEO they were unable to find a qualified woman. Therefore, Rowan Henry, a man, was hired. By late 1976, more than $1.5 million in stock had been sold to about 1300 shareholders, 63% of whom were women. Asked in the Occidental College Alumni magazine what it means to be a bank for women, Board member Dianne Modisett answered, \"It means that we eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex. An individual must still qualify for credit or a loan, but if she doesn't, we want to assist her in becoming qualified… It doesn't make any difference to us whether the woman is single, married, divorced or widowed.\"The First Women's Bank struggled to broaden its appeal beyond a small, politically-engaged customer base. In 1984, it was sold for $2.7 million and reorganized as the Guaranty Bank of California, now GBC International Bank."

ForgeRock also has offices in Bristol, London, Grenoble, Vancouver (USA), Oslo, Düsseldorf, Paris, Sydney, and Singapore. ForgeRock has raised $52 million in venture funding from Accel Partners, Foundation Capital, and Meritech Capital Partners. When Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle in January 2010, Sun’s identity and access management software was scheduled for phase out in favor of Oracle’s in-house product. ForgeRock was founded by a group of ex-Sun employees in February 2010 to continue to develop Sun’s open source identity software. ForgeRock provides identity and access management through its primary product, the ForgeRock Identity Platform. The product is built on Sun’s open source identity and access management projects. The ForgeRock Identity Platform includes Access Management (built from the OpenAM open source project), Identity Management (built from the OpenIDM open source project), Directory Services (built from the OpenDJ open source project), and Identity Gateway (built from the OpenIG open source project). OpenAM provides access management, OpenDJ is an LDAP directory service, OpenIDM is used for identity management, and OpenIG provides an identity gateway for web traffic and application programming interfaces (APIs). The source code — which has a Sun Microsystems, ForgeRock or community copyright — is freely available for use, under the terms of the Open Source Common Development and Distribution License. ForgeRock also provides pre-compiled, verified binary files, which are free of charge for use in proof-of-concept and prototype systems, but require a paid ForgeRock subscription for use in a production system."
