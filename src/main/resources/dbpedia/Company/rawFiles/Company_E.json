  "text" : "Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was founded in 1985 as the result of a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies in the U.S. Before its bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, Enron employed approximately 20,000 staff and was one of the world's major electricity, natural gas, communications and pulp and paper companies, with claimed revenues of nearly $111 billion during 2000. Fortune named Enron \"America's Most Innovative Company\" for six consecutive years. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that its reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron scandal. Enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate fraud and corruption. The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the United States and was a factor in the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. The scandal also affected the greater business world by causing the dissolution of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm. Enron filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York in late 2001 and selected Weil, Gotshal & Manges as its bankruptcy counsel. It ended its bankruptcy during November 2004, pursuant to a court-approved plan of reorganization, after one of the most complex bankruptcy cases in U.S. history. A new board of directors changed the name of Enron to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and assets of the pre-bankruptcy Enron. On September 7, 2006, Enron sold Prisma Energy International Inc., its last remaining business, to Ashmore Energy International Ltd. (now AEI)."

  "text" : "The East India Company (EIC), also known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) or the British East India Company and informally as John Company, was an English and later British joint-stock company, which was formed to pursue trade with the East Indies but ended up trading mainly with the Indian subcontinent and Qing China. Originally chartered as the \"Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies\", the company rose to account for half of the world's trade, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea and opium. The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India. The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600, making it the oldest among several similarly formed European East India Companies. Wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the Company's shares. The government owned no shares and had only indirect control. The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its own private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey and lasted until 1858 when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj. Despite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances. The company was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act passed one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of British India had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies."

In 1954–55, censorship pressures prompted it to concentrate on the humor magazine Mad, leading to the company's greatest and most enduring success. Initially, EC was privately owned by Maxwell Gaines and specialized in educational and child-oriented stories. Later, during its period of notoriety, it was owned by his son, William Gaines."

  "text" : "eBay Inc. (/ˈiːˌbeɪ/ ɪ-B-ay;) is an American multinational corporation and e-commerce company, providing consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales services via the Internet. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today it is a multibillion-dollar business with operations localized in over 30 countries. The company manages eBay.com, an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. In addition to its auction-style sales, the website has since expanded to include \"Buy It Now\" shopping; shopping by UPC, ISBN, or other kind of SKU (via Half.com); online classified advertisements (via Kijiji or eBay Classifieds); online event ticket trading (via StubHub); and other services. It previously offered online money transfers (via PayPal), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay from 2002 until 2015. The website is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged fees for listing items and again when those items are sold."

  "text" : "EMI Group Limited (originally an acronym for Electric and Musical Industries and also known as EMI Music, Music from EMI, EMI Records Ltd. or simply just EMI) was a British multinational music recording, publishing, electronics, device and systems manufacturing company headquartered in London, England from 1931 until 2011. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishing—also based in London with offices globally. The company was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but faced financial troubles and USD $4 billion in debt, leading to its acquisition by Citigroup in February 2011. Citigroup's ownership was temporary, as it announced in November 2011 that it would sell its music arm to Vivendi's Universal Music Group for $1.9 billion, and EMI's publishing business to a Sony/ATV consortium for around $2.2 billion. Other members of the Sony consortium include the Estate of Michael Jackson, The Blackstone Group, and Abu Dhabi–owned investment fund Mubadala Development Company."

  "text" : "The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings, enforces industry-adopted advertising guidelines, and ensures responsible online privacy principles for computer and video games in the United States, nearly all of Canada, and Mexico. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of violent content found in video games such as Night Trap, Mortal Kombat, and other controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content. The board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of \"content descriptors\" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences. In 2011, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff. Through the International Age Rating Coalition, this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. The ESRB also offers an online privacy certification program for websites and mobile software. The ESRB ratings system is effectively a de facto standard because of the collective leverage of the Board and the video game industry: major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, most retail stores enforce ESRB ratings, and also do not carry any games which are not rated by the organization. The ESRB rating system is primarily enforced on a voluntary basis by the video game and retail industry, and is not enforced under federal laws in any of the countries where it is actively used—however, in some parts of Canada, provincial laws require retailers to enforce the ESRB ratings system, with enforcement of these laws handled by regional film ratings boards. Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the Federal Trade Commission for being the \"strongest\" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other watchdog groups for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 incident that surrounded the organization's handling of \"hidden\", objectionable content in a game which could be accessed using a user-created modification. Critics of the ESRB have asserted that the organization has a conflict of interest because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold."

  "text" : "Eolas (Irish pronunciation: [ˈoːl̪ˠəsˠ], meaning \"Knowledge\"; bacronym: \"Embedded Objects Linked Across Systems\") is a United States technology company accused of mainly acting as a patent troll and described as \"The Web’s longest nightmare\". It was founded in 1994 by sole employee Michael David Doyle. His University of California, San Francisco team has claimed to have created the first web browser that supported plugins. They demonstrated it at Xerox PARC, in November 1993, at the second Bay Area SIGWEB meeting. The claim that this was an innovation, advanced to justify their patent application, has been contested by Pei-Yuan Wei, who developed the earlier Viola browser, which added plugin capabilities in 1992, a claim supported by inventor of the WWW Sir Tim Berners-Lee and other Web pioneers. Given only a short time to prepare, Wei was only able to demonstrate Viola's equivalent capabilities for local rather than remote files at the 2003 Eolas v. Microsoft trial, and thus fell short of proving prior art to the trial court's satisfaction. The case with Microsoft over patent 5,838,906 was settled in 2007 for a confidential amount of money after an initial $565 million judgment was stayed on appeal, but the University of California disclosed its piece of the final settlement as $30.4 million. In 2009 Eolas sued numerous other companies over patent number 7,599,985 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase had signed licensing deals with Eolas, while the company continued to seek payoffs from others. However, in February 2012, an eight-person jury in the Eastern District Court of Texas invalidated Eolas's patents 5,838,906 and 7,599,985, and in July 2012, Judge Leonard Davis ruled against Eolas. One year later, moreover, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sustained said ruling, thereby putting an end to the company's long history of very profitable \"infringement\" lawsuits."

A changing economic and retail environment in the late 20th century and mismanagement culminated in the chain's bankruptcy in 1999. Eaton's pioneered several retail innovations.

  "text" : "Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO) was started by Henry Berliner in 1930. Berliner was the son of Emile Berliner, who had patented numerous inventions relating to sound and acoustics, and pioneer of helicopter development with the experimental Berliner Helicopter. The younger Berliner founded ERCO to produce tools for the manufacture of metal aircraft and propellers. He founded the company in a shed at 2014 5th street NW Washington D.C. Berliner met Fred Weick, an aeronautical engineer, who worked with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in cowlings and propellers on a 1926 while developing the propellers for the USS Akron. Weick also worked on an experimental aircraft that incorporated the up-to-date safety features. In 1935, the company moved to 6100 Sligo Blvd. In 1936, Weick left NACA to work for ERCO on his \"safety airplane\". In 1937, Berliner purchased 50 acres of land in Riverdale, Maryland near the College Park Airport and built the large ERCO factory and airstrip. One of ERCO's most significant achievements was the development of the Ercoupe aircraft. The first experimental model of the Ercoupe was test-flown at College Park airport in 1937. It had a single tail (unlike the eventual production Ercoupes, with their characteristic twin tails) and was known as the \"Jeep\". In late 1938, ERCO searched unsuccessfully for a suitable engine for its new airplane. ERCO hired Harold Morehouse, former engineer in charge of small engine design at Continental Motors, to design a new engine. He came up with the inverted, in-line I-L 116, which provided good pilot visibility and enhanced aircraft streamlining. ERCO installed the I-L 116 in the prototype Ercoupe Model 310 in 1939. The engine performed well, but ERCO discontinued it when Continental introduced the A-65 engine in 1940, which generated comparable horsepower at half the cost. Construction of the production prototype was completed in 1939, and certification by the CAA was completed in 1940. The first Ercoupe, serial No. 1, was owned by George Brinckerhoff, the operator of the College Park Airport, and flown there. It now is at the National Air and Space Museum. During World War II, the ERCO factory made several products under contract with the U.S. government, including gun turrets. ERCO earned an \"E\" award for excellence in meeting manufacturing goals in its war contracts. In 1947, Berliner decided to leave the aviation industry and sold the drawings, tools, parts, materials and distribution rights for the Ercoupe to Sanders Aviation, although the small aircraft market had fallen into decline. In all, ERCO and Sanders Aviation sold just over 5,000 Ercoupes. In 1948, ERCO started producing aircraft simulators, becoming its main line of business. In November 1954, ERCO became part of ACF."

  "text" : "EA Sports (stylized as EA SPORTS) is a brand of Electronic Arts that creates and develops sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \"EA Sports Network\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as John Madden, it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as NBA Live, FIFA, NHL, Madden NFL, and NASCAR. The best selling EA Sports series is FIFA series with over 100 million units sold. Most games under this brand are developed by EA Canada, the studio of Electronic Arts in Burnaby, British Columbia, as well as EA Blackbox, Vancouver, British Columbia and EA Tiburon in Maitland, Florida. The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games. EA Sports inherits its motto \"It's in the game\" from the parent company, Electronic Arts. It was voiced by journalist Andrew Anthony. Unlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the best-selling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, FIFA 98, Madden NFL 98, NBA Live 98, and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation released in 2004 (FIFA 2005 was also the last PlayStation title to be released); and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox released in 2007. Madden NFL 08 also had Xbox and Nintendo GameCube releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, NASCAR Thunder 2003 and NASCAR Thunder 2004 were released not only for the PlayStation 2, but for the original PlayStation as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English Football League One team Swindon Town F.C. from the 2009–10 season onwards and the EA Sports Cup in the Republic of Ireland."

The first international locations opened in Bangkok, Thailand in 2014 and also in Abu Dhabi. A shop in Xian, China and Hong Kong opened in 2015. The mascot is now a red-eyed moose whose name is Stoney."

  "text" : "Elders Limited is an Australian-based agribusiness company that provides products such as livestock, farm supplies and grain as well as financial services to the farming community in Australia and New Zealand. The company was founded in 1839 and through a long and complex set of mergers and divestitures the company grew to become one of the major companies in Australia with a wide variety of interests in different industries, before again reverting to its agricultural roots and becoming a supplier to the farming industry. Elder Smith & Co was founded in 1839 in South Australia by Alexander Lang Elder as a new arm of his family's Scottish based merchant and shipping business. Its core business was a trading company and commission agent for wool and other agricultural products for sale back to Britain. Elder believed there were good business opportunities for trade out of the colony which had been newly proclaimed in December 1836. Elder, Smith & Co should not be confused with the company now known as Elders Limited. The South Australian company Elder, Smith & Co Limited and the Victorian company Goldsbrough Mort & Co Limited where acquired by the South Australian holding company Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Limited in 1963. Goldsbrough, Mort & Co Limited (ACN 004045121) was then demerged in 1994 under the name of Elders Limited along with the right to use the well known trading name of \"Elders\". Elders Limited was acquired by Futuris Corporation Limited (ACN 004 336 636). The name was then changed to Elders Rural Services Australia Limited. Futuris Corporation Limited then changed its name to Elders Limited. The company once known as Elder, Smith & Co Limited that was registered in South Australia on 13 July 1882 (ACN 007 869 294) remained with Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Limited and is now known as Derel Esc Pty Ltd. Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Limited is now known as Foster's Group Pty Ltd and is owned by SABMiller plc based in London. Elders Limited therefore acquired the pastoral businesses of both Elder, Smith & Co Limited and Goldsbrough, Mort & Co Limited, however Elders Limited owns the company once known as Goldsbrough, Mort & Co Limited and not the company once known as Elder Smith & Co Limited. Goldsbrough, Mort & Co Limited was registered in Victoria on 31 August 1893 and so the heritage of Elders Limited is more closely associated with the Victorian company Goldsbrough, Mort & Co Limited than with the South Australian company Elder, Smith & Co Limited from a legal viewpoint. In 1857 Richard Goldsbrough (1821-1886) established the business of R. Goldsbrough and Company with partner Hugh Parker in Melbourne. In 1881 the public company of R. Goldsbrough & Co Ltd was registered and in 1888 this company merged with the Sydney firm of Mort & Co to form Goldsbrough Mort & Co Ltd that was registered in Victoria on 31 August 1893. Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816-1878) established Mort & Co in 1862 which became Mort & Co Ltd in 1883. Mort pioneered the shipping of frozen meat from Australia to London."

  "text" : "Eddie Bauer Holdings, Inc. (EBH) is an American holding company, headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, which operates the Eddie Bauer clothing store chain. EBH was formed after Eddie Bauer's former parent company, Spiegel, Inc., went bankrupt in 2003. Eddie Bauer currently operates three independent sales channels: \n*  Retail stores - sells \"premium\" merchandise \n*  Outlet stores - sells merchandise and inventory overstocks at lower prices \n*  Direct order center - sells merchandise through call centers in Groveport, Ohio, and the company's website. The company was established in 1920 in Seattle by Pacific Northwest outdoorsman, Eddie Bauer (1899 – 1986). In 1940 Bauer patented the first quilted down jacket. He later patented numerous other designs. The company was the first independent company which the United States Army hired and allowed to use a logo on the Army-issued uniform. Bauer retired and sold the company in 1968. General Mills bought the company in 1971; in 1988, Spiegel bought it from General Mills. In 2003, Spiegel, Inc., entered bankruptcy. The Spiegel catalog and all other assets were sold, except for Eddie Bauer. In May 2005, Spiegel, Inc., emerged from bankruptcy under the name \"Eddie Bauer Holdings\" and is owned primarily by Golden Gate Capital. In addition to the three sales channels the company operates a distribution and fulfillment center in Groveport, Ohio; an IT facility in Westmont, Illinois; and a distribution center in Vaughan, Ontario. Eddie Bauer is also a minority participant in joint venture operations in Japan and Germany that include retail stores, catalogs, and websites. The company also selectively licenses the Eddie Bauer brand name and logo for various products sold through other companies including eyewear, furniture, bicycles, and, up until the 2010 model year, upper level versions of Ford Motor Company's Bronco, Explorer, Expedition and Excursion SUVs. Eddie Bauer's flagship store is in Bellevue's Bellevue Square mall. A Midwest Flagship opened in August 2010 at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio. Eddie Bauer Holdings, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware on June 17, 2009."

Engine Alliance was established in August 1996 to develop, manufacture, sell, and support a family of modern technology aircraft engines for new high-capacity, long-range aircraft. The main application for such an engine, the GP7200, was originally the Boeing 747-500/600X projects, before these were cancelled due to lack of demand from airlines. Instead, the GP7000 has been re-optimized for use on the Airbus A380 superjumbo. In that market it is competing with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900, the launch engine for the aircraft. The two variants are the GP7270 and the GP7277."

  "text" : "Estes Industries (aka Estes-Cox Corp.) is a company that was started in Denver, Colorado, USA. The company was the first to mass-produce model rocket engines with consistent and reliable performance. The company soon began producing model rocket kits, launch equipment and other accessories. In 1961, the company was moved to a 77-acre tract of land on the outskirts of Penrose, Colorado. Rapid growth followed and soon Penrose became known as the \"Model Rocket Capital of the World\". In 1969 Vernon Estes sold the company to the Damon Corporation of Needham Hts, MA. Damon purchased a number of other hobby companies including a smaller competitor of Estes, Centuri Engineering of Phoenix, AZ. Damon merged the two companies under the name Centuri Engineering. The Penrose entity continued doing business as Estes Industries. Centuri Engineering model rocket products continued to be developed, marketed and sold from the Centuri offices in Phoenix as well, although the actual manufacturing of Centuri products was soon moved to the Estes facility in Penrose, CO. Sales of Centuri model rocket products were never as successful as Estes brand products and the Centuri Engineering offices in Phoenix were finally closed and the Centuri product line was discontinued in 1983. Following a hostile takeover of the Damon Corporation in 1989, Estes Industries was divested and became part of Hobby Products. The business name of the company was shortened to Centuri Corporation. In 1996 Hobby Products acquired the assets of Cox Products of Corona, CA. Cox Products was a designer and manufacturer of model airplanes and glow-fuel model airplane engines and more. The company’s assets were moved to the Estes facility. In 2002, the combined company was sold again and the company’s name was changed to Estes-Cox Corp. On January 15, 2010 Estes-Cox was again sold and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hobbico of Illinois. Sales of the Cox line of model airplanes has been continued by Hobbico."

(江崎グリコ株式会社 Ezaki Guriko Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese confectionery company headquartered in Nishiyodogawa-ku, Osaka.The company manufactures the traditional Glico caramel candy, as well as Pocky (also known as Mikado in Europe) and many others. The company name, Glico, is derived from a shortening of the word glycogen. The first candy produced by the company was known as Glico-Caramel. The Glico 300 meter running man trademark is also derived from the original caramel candy: the candy is 15.4 kcal, which is enough energy to run exactly 300 meters. (Calculated from a formula stating that a person 165 centimeters in height and weighing 55 kilograms will burn 8.21 kcal running 160 metres in one minute. Over a period of 1.88 minutes, such a person would burn 15.4 kcal running 300 metres.) The company's large neon sign located above Dotonbori in Osaka has been a landmark of the city since its initial construction in 1935. It bears the Glico running man on a blue race track, as well as some of Osaka's other landmarks in the background. The giant neon sign has been revised on several occasions in order to celebrate events such as the World Cup and to bolster team spirit for Osaka's baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers. As the sign is quite well known, it has long been a popular photo stop for tourists as well as locals. The company was also the main sponsor of the anime series Tetsujin 28 (1963—1966, the original Japanese version of Gigantor)."

  "text" : "Eskom is a South African electricity public utility, established in 1923 as the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC) by the government of the Union of South Africa in terms of the Electricity Act (1922). It was founded by a parliamentary act, namely the Electricity Act of 1922, which allowed the Electricity Control Board to appoint Hendrik Johannes van der Bijl as the Chairman of the Board. The company was also known by its Afrikaans name Elektrisiteitsvoorsieningskommissie (EVKOM). The two acronyms were combined in 1986 and the company is now known as Eskom. Eskom represents South Africa in the Southern African Power Pool. The utility is the largest producer of electricity in Africa,} is among the top seven utilities in the world in terms of generation capacity and among the top nine in terms of sales. Eskom operates a number of notable power stations, including Kendal Power Station, and Koeberg nuclear power station in the Cape Province, the only nuclear power plant in Africa. The company is divided into Generation, Transmission and Distribution divisions and together Eskom generates approximately 95% of electricity used in South Africa. Due to the South African governments attempted privatisation of Eskom in the late 1990s, Eskom's requests for budget to build new stations were denied. President Thabo Mbeki said in December 2007 that this was an error, and it is now adversely affecting the South African economy. In January 2008 Eskom introduced \"load shedding\", planned rolling blackouts based on a rotating schedule, in periods where short supply threatens the integrity of the grid. Demand-side management has focused on encouraging consumers to conserve power during peak periods in order to reduce the incidence of load shedding."

  "text" : "Founded in 1971 — with the purpose of supplying the Brazilian refrigeration industry which, up until then, relied entirely on imported compressors — Embraco began production in 1974. It was in this same decade when it began to export to markets in the Americas. In the 1980s, the sales and distribution structure reached over 80 countries. Anticipating a globalized economy, the company decided to set up production bases overseas and soon became world leader; today it holds a 25% market share. Embraco employs approximately 10,000 people worldwide. The firm invests heavily in product design and manufacturing innovation, and supplies large international household refrigeration OEMs as well as the biggest manufacturers of commercial refrigeration equipment. Its headquarters and main factory is in Joinville, Santa Catarina, in the southern region of Brazil. Embraco also has factories in Italy, Slovakia, and China, as well as a business office in the United States. Embraco produces hermetic compressors, condensing units and sealed units, for domestic and commercial use. In 2011, Embraco North America was fined by the United States Justice Department for $91.8 million for price-fixing in the market for compressors."

The company was once famous for its arcade to console ports, but became better known for working with licensed properties such as Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, the James Bond 007 series, and Batman Begins. On 23 November 2012, Eurocom laid off around 75% of their 200 employees, in a statement company director Hugh Binns said \"... Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce redundant today ...\", attributing a \"steep decline in demand for console games\", and \"...will be focusing mainly on mobile opportunities moving forward.\" On 6 December 2012, the company laid off its remaining staff and ceased operations."

By 1976 all that was left was 6 miles (9.7 km) of track between Appleby in Westmorland and Flitholme which was used infrequently by the British Army at Warcop. In 1995 the Eden Valley Railway Society was formed with the aim of re-instating services and restoring on the line. Heritage railway services resumed in 2006 between Warcop and Sandford, with an extension of 1⁄2 mile (0.80 km) being opened in 2013, giving a current running line of almost 2 1⁄4 miles (3.6 km)."

  "text" : "E-Plus is a mobile telecommunications operator in Germany. With more than 25 million subscribers, E-Plus is the third largest mobile operator in Germany, after Telekom (38 million subscribers) and Vodafone (32 million subscribers). E-Plus has been owned by Dutch telecommunications operator KPN since 2002. In July 2013, Telefónica Germany announced a planned takeover. The deal was approved by KPN shareholders in October 2013. As of December 2013, the merger is not completed because of concerns by the European Commission on reduced competition in the German mobile market. On July, the European Commission granted Telefónica's takeover of E-plus its conditional approval with final approval expected by the end of August 2014. The company was awarded Germany's first DCS-1800 (later renamed GSM-1800) license in 1993. One term of the licence was that no further Mobile network operator could be started within 3 years of the start of the network. The network started operation as a \"metropolitan\" network, with coverage only in the biggest cities, in 1994. The coverage area was expanded rapidly, but for years the network's image was hampered by the view that its coverage was lacking. As a countermeasure, voicemail retrieval was free of charge for the first of years of operation, and calls were billed in six-second increments (in contrast to the one-minute increments of the other networks); after text messaging was introduced, it too was free for some time. E-Plus was the second network in Germany to offer prepaid tariffs to its customers (after T-Mobile's XtraCard) and later introduced HSCSD, which boosts data rates on GSM networks to analogue modem speed levels. Shortly after that, E-Plus upgraded its network to support GPRS. They now also operate a 3G UMTS network. In February 2006, after the EGSM900-band, which was in military use before, had become available in late 2005, the German regulation authority Bundesnetzagentur assigned two 2 x 5 MHz channels to E-Plus and O2 Germany. In return, E-Plus and O2 Germany had to give up some GSM1800 frequencies to two competitive operators T-Mobile and Vodafone. The first EGSM900-base stations (cell sites) started operation in April 2006. In March 2007 E-Plus outsourced deployment, management and maintenance of its network to Alcatel-Lucent and thereby transferred 750 employees to the latter company. E-Plus provides network access to numerous virtual operators, such as BASE, Blau Mobilfunk, ALDI Talk, Simyo, VIVA, JambaSIM. It also owns and operates AY YILDIZ, a mobile brand aimed at the Turks in Germany, offering affordable calls to Turkey and roaming in Turkish networks. E-Plus was the first company to introduce i-mode in Germany. At the end of February 2014, E-Plus and ZTE announced that ZTE would take over Managed Services of E-Plus. On March 5. 2014, E-Plus started commercial LTE service in Berlin, Leipzig and Nuremberg by using 10 MHz out possible of 20 MHz bandwidth of the 1800 MHz frequency. On March 12. 2014, E-Plus announced the launch of HD Voice."

  "text" : "ETA SA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse (ETA SA Swiss Watch Manufacturer) designs and manufactures quartz watches and both hand-wound and automatic-winding mechanical ébauches and movements. Commonly referred to as ETA, the company is headquartered in Grenchen, Switzerland and is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Swatch Group Ltd. Though ETA was founded by Eterna in 1856 some part of its production line can be traced back to the 1793 founding of Fabriques d’Horlogerie de Fontainemelon (FHF) by David Benguerel, Isaac Benguerel, François Humbert-Droz and Julien Humbert-Droz. Although ETA specializes in ébauches, ETA is capable of making all components necessary for a completed watch and is therefore considered a manufacture d'horlogerie. ETA movements and ébauches are used both in watches of other Swatch Group subsidiary brands and in the watches of competitors. Through a series of mergers, ETA has become the largest manufacturer of Swiss watch movements and controls a virtual monopoly over their production and supply. ETA has undergone several Swiss government investigations due to its market position. To resolve the concerns of Swiss government regulators, ETA has entered into an agreement that governs certain business practices."

The foundation receives an ongoing subvention from the Hong Kong Government. It is also funded through a tuition fee. In the 2013–2014 academic year, these fees stood at HK$90,000 per annum for primary school students and HK$101,400 per annum for Years 7-11 secondary school students (HK$106,300 for Years 12 and 13). Although all of the ESF schools are comprehensive and \"non-selective\", students in the foundation have generally done well academically, with 90% of their graduates going to different universities around the world. The schools have progressively improved their facilities, especially in ICT with the help of donations from Parent Teacher Associations. The current chief executive of the English Schools Foundation is Belinda Greer."

  "text" : "Enoki Films Co., Ltd. (エノキフイルム株式会社 Enokifuirumu Kabushiki Kaisha) is a producer of anime based in the Enoki Building in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Enoki Films also had a North American division, established in 1986, headquartered in the Encino area of Los Angeles, California, United States called Enoki Films USA, Inc.. Enoki Films USA acted as a middle-man between Japanese companies and American licensees such as 4Kids Entertainment and Saban. In May 2007 it was announced that their content would also be provided as video on demand by Internet startup ReelTime.com (worldwide except Japan). As of 2002 Enoki licenses anime but sub-licenses its licenses to various distributors instead of distributing them directly. Anime News Network wrote that \"They generally only license TV shows that they hope to also license to TV broadcasters such as Cartoon Network, ABC Family and Fox Kids.\" Some of the anime productions that were listed on Enoki's website are under alternate names and may list characters under different names as well. In many cases, when sub-licensed to anime home video companies, the original titles and character names have been restored. Enoki's translations of episode titles and scenarios may also be different than what may be on the official release. If Enoki's series' had a separate movie or direct-to-video production, it is usually not licensed by Enoki, and the film or direct-to-video production may be licensed to a separate company than the series (as is the case with the Slayers movies and OVAs and the Utena movie). As of 2016, Enoki Films' North American division is now defunct, since it bought its operations to an end in 2010."

  "text" : "Einstein Bros. Bagels is a bagel and coffee chain in the United States. Einstein Bros. was created by the chain restaurant corporation Boston Chicken (now Boston Market) in 1995, as a way to market breakfast foods. The chain is now owned by Einstein and Noah Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Inc. Boston Chicken, Inc. originally formed the Einstein and Noah Bagel Corporation as Progressive Bagel Concepts, Incorporated (PBCI) in March 1995, when it purchased three retail bagel chains, all located in regions of the United States that did not have longstanding bagel traditions. These companies included Offerdahl's Bagel Gourmet, Incorporated (Fort Lauderdale), Bagel & Bagel, Incorporated (Kansas City), Baltimore Bagel (San Diego), and Brackman Brothers, Incorporated (Salt Lake City). Each found that their stores were similar in that they offered both original and new bagel flavors in rich neighborhoods where the customers had relatively little previous exposure to bagels. Noah's Bagels was founded by Noah Alper on College Avenue in Berkeley, California. In 1996, the chain of 38 stores was sold to Einstein Bros. for $100 million. New World Coffee was founded in the early 1990s by Ramin Kamfar, an investment banker who left his finance career to open a coffee shop. It bought Manhattan Bagel out of bankruptcy in 1998. The combined company purchased Washington, D.C.-based Chesapeake Bagel Bakery in 1999 when that chain had 89 stores, giving Manhattan approximately 350 locations. By 2000, Einstein Bros. was in financial trouble, having loaned too much money to franchisees. After it declared bankruptcy, New World Coffee, which had earlier attempted an unsuccessful hostile takeover, bought the company out of bankruptcy for $190 million. In 2014, Einstein Noah Restaurant Group was acquired by JAB Holding Company and BDT Capital Partners."

The following year, Civita changed its name to Abril - referencing the month in which \"Spring Breaks\" begins on the northern hemisphere - - and published its first title, Donald Duck, in Brazil called Pato Donald, which continues to run to this date. Abril's first magazine lead Civita to claim \"It all started with a duck\", parodying Walt Disney's declaration that \"I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by Mickey Mouse. Under its name it publishes titles like AnaMaria, Tititi, Minha Novela, Sou+Eu!, Quatro Rodas, Veja, Nova, Placar, Claudia, Boa Forma, Manequim, and Exame, as well as the Brazilian editions of Disney comics, Cosmopolitan, Men's Health, Women's Health, Runner's World, and Playboy. It also owns the Brazilian MTV and cable company Abril Grafica. In May 2006, Naspers acquired a 30% interest in Editora Abril. On the internet, Abril owns the most popular website aimed to women, named MdeMulher, with 5 million visitors monthly."

  "text" : "ENAIRE is the air navigation manager in Spain, certified for the provision of en route, approach and aerodrome control services. As a public corporate entity attached to the Ministry for Public Works, it is responsible for air traffic control, aeronautical information and the communication, navigation and surveillance networks necessary so that air companies and their aircraft can fly safely, fluidly and in an orderly manner within Spanish airspace. It is the fourth largest air navigation service provider in Europe by volume of air traffic, with around 2 million flights per year. ENAIRE manages these 2.2 million square kilometres of airspace from 5 air control centres (Barcelona, Canary Islands, Madrid, Palma de Mallorca and Seville) and 22 control towers. It looks after controlling a complex airspace of over 2,000,000 square km, comprising one continental, and one oceanic, area. It also handles flights entering Europe from America and Africa as Spain is the port of entry linking traffic from Africa and South America with Europe, and especially with Germany, France and the United Kingdom. ENAIRE provides a flexible service capable of adapting to the seasonal nature of air traffic in Spain, where there is a considerably larger number of flights in the summer season as Spain receives the third largest number of tourists in the world. ENAIRE is in the research and technology vanguard in its sector at a worldwide level and it participates in all the projects of the European Union related to the implantation of the Single European Sky, such as the group A6 and the European joint undertaking iTEC (with Indra and the air navigation providers NATS (United Kingdom), DFS (Germany), LVNL (Netherlands), Avinor (Norway), PANSA (Poland) and Oro Navigacija (Lithuania). ENAIRE is also a full member of CANSO. Further, ENAIRE owns 51% of the capital of Aena S.A., the world's largest airport manager, with a network of 46 airports and 2 heliports in Spain. These include Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas, Barcelona-El Prat, Palma de Mallorca and Málaga-Costa del Sol. This network records more than 207 million passengers per year. In addition, Aena S.A. participates in the management of 15 further airports in the United Kingdom, Colombia and Mexico."

  "text" : "Equity Media Holdings Corporation was a broadcasting company based in Little Rock, Arkansas that owned and operated television stations across the United States. Prior to March 30, 2007, the company was known as Equity Broadcasting, a name later used for its broadcast station subsidiary. The company had a focus on Hispanic and Asian American communities in large markets while owning a combination of English-language network affiliates in medium and small markets. Equity was known for its use of broadcast automation to control dozens of small, local UHF television broadcasting stations from one central Little Rock location; the feeds were readily visible on free-to-air satellite television through much of North America, despite the very small terrestrial footprint of the individual stations over the air. Most commonly, Equity stations were low-power television affiliates of Univision, Fox, The WB/UPN or carried music videos and classic television reruns. In late 2005, Equity launched the Retro Television Network (RTN for short), a programming service with a lineup of \"classic\" shows from the 1950s through the 1980s which currently airs in part or full in numerous markets (controversially replacing UPN in one). Equity sold RTN to Luken Communications in June 2008. Equity filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 8, 2008 and auctioned the individual stations on April 16, 2009. Many stations were sold to broadcast companies such as Daystar Television Network."

  "text" : "Elixir Studios was a British video game developer. The company was founded in 1998 by Demis Hassabis, formerly a prominent figure at Lionhead Studios. At its height, it employed around sixty people, and was based in London. It aimed to be an independent developer, creating its own intellectual properties rather than licensing established ones. The company's first game, Republic: The Revolution, was released in 2003, and a second game, Evil Genius, was released in 2004. In 2005, however, the company announced that it would be closing. This followed the cancellation of development on a major project due to its \"perceived high-risk\", which had been underway for two years. The company, citing \"the current risk averse publishing climate\", concluded that its goal of exploring new territory was not possible. In a press release, Hassabis said: \"It seems that today's games industry no longer has room for small independent developers wanting to work on innovative and original ideas. ... [T]his was the sole purpose of setting up Elixir and something we could never compromise on.\" Elixir stated that it had sufficient resources to pay redundancy packages to its staff and ensure that the company was wound down in an orderly manner. Rebellion Developments bought Elixir's intellectual property in March 2006, including Evil Genius."

  "text" : "Evisu or Evisu Genes is a Japanese designer clothing company that specializes in producing denim wear through traditional, labor-intensive methods. The brand was founded in 1991 in Osaka, Japan, by Hidehiko Yamane. The initial production line allowed about 14 pairs of jeans a day to be produced, with each of them having a seagull (kamome) hand painted on them by Yamane himself. Ebisu is the name of the Japanese folk god of money who is usually portrayed with a fishing rod. His name was selected for the new venture as money and fishing are two of Yamane's five favorite things. In the early 1990s Yamane introduced a tailoring line, followed by fishing and golf lines. In 1999, he introduced a ladies fashion line called Evisu Donna to complete the development of Evisu as a full-fashion range going far beyond a jeans brand. Evisu now has 65 shops in Japan. In March 2006, the company and Yamane were reported to Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office with another firm on suspicion of tax evasion. Yamane and the two firms stood accused of concealing more than 500 million yen of income as well as evading some 160 million yen in taxes over three years. In 2009, Evisu was relaunched, and Scott Morrison, the co-founder of Paper Denim & Cloth and Earnest Sewn, was added to the Evisu team as CEO and creative Director."

  "text" : "Eisenhuth Horseless Vehicle Company was a manufacturer of Brass Age automobiles who were originally based in New York City. In 1902 the company purchased the Keating Wheel and Automobile Company and established manufacturing operations in Middletown, Connecticut. During 1903, the company merged with the Graham Fox Motor Car Company, absorbing that firm and expanding operations in Middletown. In 1904, the company was sued by Colonel Frank A. Fox of the Graham Fox Motor Car Company, who claimed that he had \"invented certain essential features of the motors now being made by the Eisenhuth company,\" and went bankrupt in 1907. In 1909, the Eisenhuth factory was sold to the \"Noiseless Typewriter Company.\" Their automobile was an unusual model called the Compound with three cylinders. Two were working cylinders, the larger middle one further expanded the exhaust gases of the outer working cylinders, this concept received later the name: '5-Stroke engine'."

In 2005, GM sold EMD to Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC, which formed Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc., to facilitate the purchase. On August 2, 2010, Progress Rail Services Corporation completed the purchase of Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. from Greenbriar, Berkshire, et al. making Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of \"Progress Rail Services Corporation\" (itself a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc). EMD's headquarters, engineering facilities and parts manufacturing operations are physically located in McCook, Illinois. EMD's final locomotive assembly operations are located in Muncie, Indiana.EMD operates a traction motor maintenance, rebuild and overhaul facility in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

  "text" : "Energy Brands, also doing business as Glacéau, is a privately owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company based in Whitestone, New York City that manufactures and distributes various lines of enhanced water. Founded in May 1996 by J. Darius Bikoff with an electrolyte enhanced line of water called Smartwater, Energy Brands initially distributed its products to health food stores and independent retailers in the New York area. Adding Fruitwater and Vitaminwater to its line in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the company expanded to nationwide distribution in the early 2000s. By 2002, the Glacéau line of waters were the top selling enhanced water brand in the United States, with the company's Vitaminwater being its best selling product. In 2006, the company earned US$350 million in revenues. The company then began its global expansion, launching its products in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2008, France in 2009 and Argentina in 2011. Energy Brands is owned primarily by Bikoff, employees, and small investors. Rapper 50 Cent obtained a minority share of the company as part of an endorsement deal in the company. 30% of the equity was sold to LVMH sometime in the 2000s, which in turn sold those shares. The shares eventually were sold to India-based Tata Group in August 2006, which held the shares until May 2007 when The Coca-Cola Company purchased the company as an independent subsidiary, leaving its actual operations with its existing management including Bikoff."

The company has five locations, including four in Torrance: its headquarters, a distribution center and museum, the Russell division (which also houses the shock manufacturing center), and the exhaust plant. Its foundry is in San Jacinto, California. Vic Edelbrock founded the corporation in 1938. When his desire to increase the performance of his 1932 Ford Roadster led him to design a new intake manifold, friends and fellow drivers soon wanted one as well. This transformed his repair garage into a parts manufacturing enterprise, making one-of-a-kind equipment for automobiles. In many ways, Vic Edelbrock helped to invent the automotive aftermarket parts industry. Today, Edelbrock manufactures over 8,000 automotive parts for racers and hobbyists, focusing on increased performance. The company relies on online and catalog resellers and thus offers no direct sales for the bulk of its catalog."

On September 27, 2011 Esprit Holdings Ltd. was valued at just $1.4 billion, a loss of more than 90 percent from a $20 billion valuation four years prior. According to Credit Suisse, Esprit's brand is valued at $3.4 billion since 2012 Esprit has lost its global recognition and is in decline. Esprit has pulled out of most global markets, reducing stores in China, Australia, Hong Kong and closing North America and Canada. Their name recognition is almost nonexistent."

On April 21, 2009, Broadcom made a proposal to the Emulex board of directors to buy all existing shares of Emulex for $764 million, or $9.25 per share, a 40% premium over the stock's closing price on April 20, 2009. After Emulex's board of directors recommended against the sale, Broadcom increased the company's offer to $11 per share on June 30, which valued the company at $925 million. It too was rejected on July 9, 2009. Subsequently, Broadcom announced it would withdraw its offer. In February 2015, it was announced that Avago Technologies Limited (which later merged with Broadcom) reached an agreement to acquire Emulex Corporation for $8 per share in cash."

Exetel resells products from NBN Co, Telstra, Optus, Verizon Business, AAPT & BigAir. Many of the larger Australian ISPs have chosen to deploy their own infrastructure (including wireless) in order to provide faster and less expensive services than Telstra offers. Exetel does not deploy its own infrastructure outside of its own switching centres. Instead, it is a wholesale customer of Tier 1 wholesale telco providers who provide IP Transit, Intercapital Transmission and various Residential and Business Grade Access Network products that Exetel integrate and manage for its customers. Exetel donates one third of the profit it makes to various, community based, endangered species protection and regeneration programs around Australia. Almost $450,000 was donated in 2009. Details on all of these programs can be found on the website."

  "text" : "Eagle Boys is an Australian fast food chain specialising in Italian-American cuisine, in particular pizza. With more than 120 stores throughout Australia, it is the fourth largest pizza chain in Australia, with 12% of the share of the country's pizza market recorded in June 2015. Eagle Boys was founded in Albury, New South Wales by businessman Tom Potter in 1987. Since 1992, Eagle Boys national headquarters have been located in Annerley, Queensland. In 2007 NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought Eagle Boys from Potter. At the chain's peak, in 2013, more than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought in to the head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets."

Many accessories such as cases and Airline straps are made in Canada.\" The company was established in 2001 with the intent of manufacturing replicas of rare vintage electric guitars. The company's production philosophy is to create guitars which not only evoke classic looks and vintage sounds, but that are to be sold at a price point where they are meant to be played and not simply collected. Much of the company's focus is on building reproductions of famous discontinued electric guitar models such as the Valco Airline, and the Supro Coronado. As of summer 2012, Eastwood Guitars produced around 60 guitar models, many of which having been well received by players and reviews. The company also produces bass guitars which are either reproductions of classic bass guitar designs or adopted from current Eastwood guitar designs, as well as exotic variants such as electric mandolins, ukuleles and lap steel guitars."

  "text" : "Energex is an Australian electric power distribution company owned by the Government of Queensland. It is based in Brisbane and was founded in 1922 as the City Electric Light Co. (CEL). From 1977 to 1997, prior to the formation of the National Electricity Market (NEM), the company was known as the South East Queensland Electricity Board (SEQEB), the role of which was to provide electricity to South East Queensland. Following the formation of the NEM, the SEQEB was corporatised in 1997, becoming Energex. It established itself as a multi-utility provider, supplying LPG and natural gas in addition to electricity, and expanded its operations into the southern states, and now supplies gas to New South Wales and Victoria. Energex's head corporate office was previously located at 150 Charlotte Street, Brisbane. The company finalised relocation to a new purpose built office building adjacent to Breakfast Creek Road, Newstead, at an old gasworks site. Construction works of the Cox Rayner/BVN Donovan Hill-designed Energex headquarters commenced in June 2008 and were completed in the first half of 2010. The street address of Energex's new corporate headquarters is 26 Reddacliff Street, Newstead."

  "text" : "(\"East Lancs\" redirects here. For other uses, see East Lancs (disambiguation).) East Lancashire Coachbuilders Limited was a manufacturer of bus bodies and carriages founded in 1934 in Blackburn, Lancashire, England. In 1994 the company expanded into new premises and commenced a programme of development that resulted in a range of single and double deck buses which was the primary source of income for the company. On 17 August 2007, the company went into administration, but was saved and bought out by the Darwen Group the next day. It is thought that the problem was a direct consequence of changing to the Euro IV chassis, with a shortage of Scania chassis being a factor. After the purchase, the Darwen Group rebranded the company as Darwen East Lancs. In 2008, Jamesstan Investments, an investment company controlled by the Darwen Group, purchased another bus manufacturer, Optare. Later, in June 2008, a reverse takeover was performed, with the Darwen name disappearing in favour of Optare's. This brings East Lancs name into the Optare Group, with an expanded range of vehicles. Production of all the original East Lancs bodies ceased by 2011, and the premises in Blackburn closed in 2012."

  "text" : "Ergon Energy is a corporation owned by the Government of Queensland. It distributes electricity to around 700,000 customers across Queensland, excluding South East Queensland through a distribution network regulated by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), who set the prices that Ergon is allowed to charge for distribution. Ergon Energy was formed in 1999 by the Queensland Government, from the then six regional Queensland electricity distributors and their subsidiary retailers. In 2007 the Queensland Government privatised the retail activities of Ergon, with the sale of approximately 50,000 contestable electricity customers and retailer trading activities to AGL. Smaller electricity customers which are not economic continue to be billed by Ergon Energy and the electricity distribution network remains in public ownership. Today the principal operating companies are Ergon Energy Corporation Limited, as the electricity distributor, and its subsidiary Ergon Energy Queensland Pty Ltd, the electricity retailer. Ergon Energy’s retailer is only permitted, by legislation, to sell electricity at the Queensland Government’s Notified Prices (overseen by the Australia Energy Regulator(AER)), enabling Queenslanders to access the same uniform electricity tariffs. The electricity generation and distribution network consists of approximately 150,000 kilometres of powerlines and one million power poles, along with associated infrastructure such as major substations and power transformers. Ergon Energy also owns and operates 33 stand-alone power stations that provide supply to communities across Queensland which are not connected to the main electricity grid. Since August 2007, Ergon Energy has owned and operated the Barcaldine gas-fired power station along with its associated infrastructure, which supplies power to the main grid. Ergon owns the Windorah Solar Farm, a $4,500,000 project completed in December 2008 producing up to 360,000 kWh of electricity a year, reducing the town of Windorah's need for diesel powered generators, and reducing fuel consumption by more than 100 000 litres annually. The company controls subsidiary is Ergon Energy Telecommunications Pty Ltd, trading as Nexium Telecommunications, which services Ergon Energy’s communications needs and, as a licensed telecommunications carrier, offers the Queensland marketplace wholesale high-speed data services. Ergon is also a shareholder in a joint venture with Energex Limited (its south-east Queensland counterpart), SPARQ Solutions Pty Ltd, which provides information and communications technology (ICT) solutions and services to both organisations."

Various members of \"the prophetic movement\" have credited their exposure and/or popularity to their writings on the Elijah List, including Catherine Brown, Chuck Pierce, Kim Clement, Kathie Walters and Victoria Boyson. The Elijah List was holding conferences as early as November 2000. It gained significant readership following the September 11 attacks in 2001. In a March 2006 profile, Charisma noted that \"The Elijah List has more than 127,000 subscribers and has become the largest platform for prophetic ministers.\""

  "text" : "ELVO (standing for Elliniki Viomihania Ohimaton, English translation: Hellenic Vehicle Industry), is a Greek vehicle manufacturer based in Thessaloniki. Although it certainly is neither the oldest, nor the most \"Greek\" in its original technology (it was founded in 1972 after an agreement with Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria), it is one that managed to survive the evolutions that basically wiped out the Greek motor industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as it was the only state-owned company in its field. It started business as Steyr Hellas S.A. assembling and manufacturing trucks, motorbikes and farm tractors (Steyr and Puch models). Significant orders for trucks and buses by the Greek Army and state authorities soon gave momentum to the company (some say, at the expense of other manufacturers). The tractor division declined in the 1980s, as the company focused on military vehicles; in 1986 it changed its name to ELVO. The Greek company's first original designs were a 3-tonne truck in 1980 (not industrially produced) and a military bus (chassis and body) in 1981. In the same year it undertook the construction of \"its own\" Leonidas Armored Personnel Carrier (in fact Steyr’s 4K 7FA model built with minor modifications, again with progressively increasing local content). In 1987 ELVO introduced Leonidas-2, this time with significant modifications of its own. Hundreds were built, while a number of different versions were proposed. In the years that followed, ELVO became a major producer of military and civilian trucks for a variety of uses (all based on Steyr models), engines (Steyr types, many for export to the Austrian company itself), military jeeps (Mercedes-Benz G-Class under licence), customized vehicles and machinery, and buses, with significant exports. Production of buses usually involved body construction on imported chassis; only a few models actually included complete ELVO chassis design and construction, among them the Midas and Europe models of 1993, and a number of military bus types. ELVO-bodied Scania L113 buses exported to Trans-Island Bus Services, Singapore in 1996 were welcomed by that country’s press as the first low-floor buses in the wider region. A number of ambitious plans for company development and new products were not realized, as the state character of the company linked it to effects from government changes and mismanagement. Although it pulled out of a 1988 agreement with Steyr for an Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle Development, ELVO rather surprised many in 1998, introducing a particularly advanced Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle of its own design and development, named Kentaurus. However, the vehicle to this date has not been ordered by the Greek military due to reduced budgets. Another step towards original developments was its initiative for the creation of a light sports car, which was assigned to TWT (an engineering company created in Germany by Greek engineer Dimitris Vartziotis, with facilities in Germany and Greece). The prototype of the ELVO Aletis (meaning \"tramp\" in Greek), an attractive car designed by Pininfarina with Volkswagen engine, was introduced in the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung in Frankfurt in 2001, but was never produced. In 2000, ELVO was partly privatised, when the Greek Mytilineos metal and engineering group acquired 43% and undertook the company management. The company faced severe financial problems due to reduced orders in 2009, after production (in cooperation with a number of Greek companies) of 140 Leopard 2 Hel MBTs under licence of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), had been completed. It is understood that the management of the company reverted to the Greek state in 2010. The Greek state petitioned to put ELVO into receivership in January 2014. The plan under the receivership proposal was to split ELVO in two with a bad company carrying debts and obligations and a good company that it was hoped would be attractive to an external partner. By 2015, the company was in the process of being dissolved. However, in April 2015 the dissolution had been frozen as the Greek government sought to find a private buyer for the company, citing its strategic importance to the Greek defence industrial base."

Its latest constructions include an advanced high-speed ferry type, of which two have been so far delivered (in 2005 and 2007). Other company divisions and activities include ship repair and conversions, and industrial constructions. The latter has undertaken specialized metal and mechanical structures for the Greek industry, port cranes, huge mining equipment, as well as rolling stock, especially freight rail wagons. The company, like others in its field, has been recently hard hit by the crisis in the European shipbuilding sector and the intense competition from Southeast Asian companies. After its 1997 acquisition by Neorion shipyards things temporarily improved, but problems persist and there are talks for a necessary further consolidation of the Greek shipbuilding industry."

With discretion, the family took full control of the company in 1890. The company produces non-ferrous metals and derivatives, nickel alloys and superalloys, and high-performance special steels. Through its subsidiary Société Le Nickel (SLN), the company has its historical roots in nickel mining, and for over 100 years has maintained a large mining operation in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. It is also a major producer of manganese from mines in Gabon. Eramet's chairman and CEO is Patrick Buffet and its headquarters is in Paris in the Tour Montparnasse."

Ball collaborated with George Fullerton, a former employee at Fender, to develop the Earthwood acoustic bass guitar, which was introduced in 1972. It is notable for being the first modern acoustic bass guitar. The guitar model featured a bolt-on hard rock maple neck, similar to that on Fender electric and acoustic guitars of the period. The design proved problematic, with too much stress for top. Warranty repairs became very expensive for the company. Later guitars were reinforced but production ceased after only a couple of years."

Currently Rajeev Vasudeva serves as CEO and Damien O'Brien as Chairman. The firm has some 2000 employees, including 452 consultants. In early 2013, the firm rebranded worldwide, dropping International from its name. The firm offers services and expertise in the fields of Executive Search, Board Consulting and Leadership Strategy Services. Academic research by the Harvard Business School has examined Egon Zehnder's history, reward culture and the creation of different practices in the mid-1990s. One of the principles that the firm claims for itself - operating as a single profit center - was described in an article by Ronald Heifetz, Alexander Grashow, Marty Linsky in the Harvard Business Review (July 2009). In his book \"Working with Emotional Intelligence\", US business author Daniel Goleman introduced his theory of emotional intelligence. In the chapter \"The emotionally intelligent organization\" he describes various firms, including Egon Zehnder."

  "text" : "Energy Northwest (formerly Washington Public Power Supply System) is a United States public power joint operating agency formed by State law in 1957 to produce at-cost power for Northwest utilities. Headquartered in Richland, Washington, the WPPSS became commonly known as \"Whoops\" due to over-commitment to nuclear power in the 1970s which brought about financial collapse and the second largest municipal bond default in U.S. history. WPPSS was renamed Energy Northwest in November 1998. Agency membership includes 28 public power utilities, including 23 of the State’s 24 public utility districts. Energy Northwest is governed by two boards: an executive board and a board of directors. The executive board has 11 members: five representatives from the board of directors, three gubernatorial appointees and three public representatives selected by the board of directors. The board of directors includes a representative from each member utility. The consortium’s nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar projects deliver nearly 1,300 megawatts of electricity to the Northwest power grid. Current power projects include White Bluffs Solar Station, Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, Nine Canyon Wind Project, and Columbia Generating Station nuclear power plant. Energy Northwest functions as a municipal corporation, similar to a town or city. That legal status allows the agency to issue public bonds to raise the financial capital necessary to build additional power generating and other public utility facilities. New power generating facilities currently under consideration include additional wind power sites throughout Washington; a 320-megawatt natural gas plant in Kalama, Washington; a carbonless energy park in eastern Washington; and three solar projects in Oregon at 5-megawatts each. The agency also provides a variety of business services in the energy, power generation and technical fields, including a range of project management and facility operations and maintenance services. In April 2006, Energy Northwest achieved ISO 14001:2004 registration, formalizing its environment stewardship program."

  "text" : "Eton Racing Boats (commonly referred to as ERB) was a manufacturer of racing boats for rowing, based in Eton, United Kingdom. The company was founded by Eton College, who also funded the construction of the Dorney Lake development. The company ceased trading on Friday 16 February 2007 due to insufficient profits and stiff competition from cheaper good quality rowing equipment. Eric Sims continues to offer equipment supplies via a separate outlet. The former company website claimed that \"boats from the Eton workshops have frequently won Henley medals and world championships\". The firm also manufactured and sold range of accessories and other products for the sport, including outriggers, megaphones, coaching launches and pontoons, as well as providing maintenance services."

At its outset the program was embraced by both Democratic and Republican administrations as a method to defund expensive subsidized housing. It was also supported by land development interests to prevent competition in the home building industry. Initial funding came from Rouse's ACTION partners Richard King Mellon, David Rockefeller, Andrew Heiskell, Ford Foundation, and other Rouse affiliates including Kittamaqundi Community leader Gordon Cosby, Robert McNamara, Senator Mac Mathias. Although in private control, Enterprise relies heavily on federal incentives, loan guarantees and financing from agencies such as the FHA."

  "text" : "ESPN Events (formerly ESPN Regional Television, ESPN Regional, and until 2008, ESPN Plus) is an American college football regional bowl game planning division and formerly a sports programming syndicator that is owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between the Disney–ABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company (which owns a controlling 80% stake) and the Hearst Corporation (which owns the remaining 20%). ESPN Events is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, sharing its operations with sister network ESPNU. Prior to its purchase by ESPN, the company was known as Creative Sports, which in turn merged with Don Ohlmeyer's Ohlmeyer Communications Corporation Sports (OCC Sports). The corporation organizes sporting events for broadcast across the ESPN family of networks, including, most prominently, a group of college football bowl games. Most of ESPN's syndicated broadcasts had been previously presented under the on-air name ESPN Plus. However, the brand has since been phased out from its productions in favor of conference brands, such as SEC TV and the Big 12 Network. The unit produced sporting events for syndication on broadcast stations, regional sports networks; these telecasts were also available on the ESPN GamePlan and ESPN Full Court out-of-market sports packages until they were merged and unified into ESPN College Extra in 2015, and from 2007 to 2015, on WatchESPN. It shuttered and closed down operations in 2015 with the loss of its last remaining major college sports conference, The American Athletic Conference to Sinclair Broadcast Group's new TV syndication division, the American Sports Network with the lone exception of the considerably less-profile and small Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference."

Between 1998 and 2002 all of BASF's cassette lineup (Ferro Extra, Chrome Extra and Chrome Super, along with the budget tapes Sound 1 and Sound 2) were rebranded EMTEC. While cassette manufacture has since ceased in 2005, and reel-to-reel tape operations were sold to RMGI, EMTEC continues to manufacture other recordable media such as optical discs, MiniDV and VHS cassettes, USB 2.0 and 3.0 Flash Drives. The Flash drives come in a variety of storage sizes. Distribution channels have decreased and EMTEC presence in the market is a shadow of its former BASF self. Since its sale by BASF, EMTEC has undergone several transformations."

  "text" : "Kevin and Beth Schippers opened the first restaurant on Water Street in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 1988. The store and sandwiches are named after characters in stories Kevin's father used to tell him. In 2003, Schippers was awarded Wisconsin’s 2003 Emerging Small Business Person from the Small Business Administration. Because of Kevin's desire to pursue the ministry, in 2003 Schippers sold the franchising company to investors led by primary owner Eric Wolfe. Kevin Schippers continues to own the original Eau Claire location. Erbert & Gerbert's prepare their sandwiches by cutting the bread and taking out the soft white dough part and leaving the guts on top of the sandwich. In 2009, Erbert & Gerbert's was awarded a Gold Effie Award for their advertising campaign, designed by Colle+McVoy. To celebrate the 20 year anniversary of Erbert & Gerbert's, a commercial was created allegedly using the world's largest Air Vortex Cannon."

  "text" : "E Ink Corporation is a privately held manufacturer of electrophoretic displays (EPDs), a kind of electronic paper. E Ink is located in Billerica, Massachusetts, and was co-founded in 1997 by undergraduates J.D. Albert & Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson (professor in the MIT Media Lab), Jerome Rubin (LexisNexis co-founder) and Russ Wilcox. Two years later, E Ink partnered with Philips to develop and market the technology. Jacobson and Comiskey are listed as inventors on the original patent filed in 1996. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. E Ink has since partnered with various companies, including Sony, Motorola and Amazon, to allow for the development of products like the Sony Reader, MOTOFONE F3, Barnes & Noble Nook, Kindle and Kobo eReader, which all utilize E Ink displays. On June 1, 2009, E Ink Corporation announced an agreement to be purchased by one of its primary business partners, Prime View International (PVI), a Hsinchu, Taiwan-based manufacturer, for over $400 million. It is predicted that the acquisition will speed the development of color E Ink. PVI renamed itself E Ink Holdings Inc. after the purchase. E Ink's \"Vizplex\" technology is used by Nook, Kindle 2, txtr Beagle and Kobo Mini. E Ink's \"Pearl\" technology is claimed to have a 50% better contrast ratio. It is used by 2011-2012 Kindle models, Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch, Kobo Touch and Sony PRS-T1. E Ink's \"Carta\" technology is used by Kindle Paperwhite (2nd and 3rd generation), Kindle Voyage, Kobo Glo HD, Kobo Aura H2O and Kindle Oasis."

The company is based in Vienna, Virginia and runs its organizations' programs across the world. Critics have accused the company of recruiting students by claiming that attendance is selective, when the company actually markets its programs to tens of thousands of youth. In 2009, the company attracted 15,000 youth to events related to President Barack Obama's inauguration, but was unable to fulfill the promises it made in its promotional materials. It settled a lawsuit, promising to pay out up to $17 million in vouchers to event attendees."

  "text" : "EA Salt Lake is an American video game developer located in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. It is owned by video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA). EA Salt Lake was founded by the studio's president, Vance Cook, as Headgate Studios in 1992. As a veteran programmer for years at Access Software, the onetime premier developer of golf simulations, Cook had the experience and knowledge of how to create a rewarding golfing experience. Headgate's first product was PentaCalc, a scientific calculator for Windows. From 1996 to 1999, Headgate solely developed golf games published by Sierra Entertainment under Sierra's Front Page Sports brand. In April 1996 the studio was purchased by Sierra. The golf product was later branded as PGA Championship Golf. On February 22, 1999 Sierra announced a major restructuring of their company, and sold the rights of the original studio back to Cook as a new corporate entity. In 2000, Headgate began publishing games through Electronic Arts. Headgate began developing Tiger Woods PGA Tour for the PC based on their existing golf engine. They were assigned by EA to develop the title on PC, PS2, Wii and Xbox for the 2007 title, and the PC, PS2, and Wii for the 2008 title, with the Xbox line getting cut by EA. Headgate developed every Windows version of the EA Sports Tiger Woods golf franchise from 2001 to 2007. Headgate's golf games consistently got high praise from industry reviewers and have won numerous industry awards. On 1 December 2006, Headgate Studios was acquired by Electronic Arts. Headgate was redubbed EA Salt Lake. The studios' focus was redirected to developing games for Nintendo's new console, the Wii. On 21 July 2010, EA Salt Lake was moved from its home in Bountiful, Utah to a new state-of-the-art facility in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, United States."

  "text" : "Eesti Gaas AS is a natural gas company with headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia. It imports, sells and distributes natural gas in the Estonian market. In addition, it sells electricity. Eesti Gaas was established in 1990 as a state enterprise. The company was partly privatized in 1993–1995. In 1993, 30% stake in Eesti Gaas was transferred to Lentransgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, to eliminate the gas debt dispute. In 1994, Ruhrgas (later: E.ON Ruhrgas) acquired about 15% of the company's shares while the management of the company together with other private investors, and the UK-based Baltic Republic Fund acquired 7.5% of shares both. As a result, the Government of Estonia kept 39% stake. In December 1996, Ruhrgas increased its stake to 21%; 12% was sold to public. In January 1999, the remaining state-owned shares were sold. Ruhrgas increased its stake up to 32%, Gazprom kept its 30% stake and Neste (later Fortum) got 10% stake. Later that year Itera (now part of Rosneft) Latvian branch acquired nearly 10% stake from the Baltic Republic Fund. In following years, Gazprom increased its stake up to 37%, E.ON up to 33.66% and Fortum up to 17.7% by buying shares from private investors. In 2014, E.ON sold its stake to Fortum, which became the largest shareholder with 51.4% stake. In February 2016, it was announced that Fortum will sell its stake to Trilini Energy, a company controlled by the investment firm Infortar, the major shareholder of the shipping company Tallink. Later Trilini also acquired 50.9% of shares qoned previously by Gazprom. In 1998, all regional subsidiaries of Eesti Gaas were merged into the parent company. In December 2004, the gas infrastructure construction activities were transferred to the separate subsidiary, AS EG Ehitus. In 2005, the gas grid services (transmission and distribution) were transferred to the newly established subsidiary company EG Võrguteenus. In 2013 the distribution network was separated from EG Võrguteenus into a newly established subsidiary of Eesti Gaas, AS Gaasivõrgud. In 2014, to implement the EU 3rd energy package EG Võrguteenus was separated from Eesti Gaas. In 2013, Eesti Gaas started to sell electricity."

  "text" : "Eminent Technology is American audio electronics company based in Florida, established in 1983 by Bruce Thigpen. Their first product was an air bearing straight line tracking tonearm for phonograph playback, and was the first implementation of a captured air bearing for tonearm use. It was followed by a more advanced version of the tonearm. In 1985 the company began developing planar magnetic loudspeakers and in 1987 introduced the world's first full range push-pull planar magnetic loudspeaker, the LFT-3. Another of the company's products is the Thigpen Rotary Woofer. Typical subwoofer products are inefficient at producing desired sound pressure levels at frequencies below 20 Hz, but the TRW is designed to cover the range down to 1 Hz of the sound spectrum. (The technical principle would allow even zero Hz.) In the 90s Eminent Technology developed a smaller planar transducer for automotive applications.This was adapted for computer speakers as the LFT-11, a multimedia speaker system, The company licensed the technology to Sonigistix and it appeared in Monsoon and other brands. Currently five US patents have been granted to Eminent Technology products. The company manufactures most of its products at its own facility in Tallahassee, Florida."

  "text" : "The Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) (Greek: Αρχή Ηλεκτρισμού Κύπρου (ΑΗΚ)) was founded in 1952 by the British colonial government. The 28 private electricity companies of the time were nationalized and absorbed into the EAC. The Authority never received any subsidies from the government as these have always been prohibited by law. Its head office is located in Strovolos. The EAC currently holds a near monopoly on electricity generation in Cyprus. It operates through three power stations with a total capacity of 1460MW: \n*  Dhekelia Power Station - 460MW \n*  Moni Power Station - 140MW + 125MW in storage and set for disassembly \n*  Vasilikos Power Station - 860MW The company also distributes electricity produced by five privately held windfarms: \n*  Orites - 82MW \n*  Santa Anna - 20MW \n*  Alexigros - 31.5MW \n*  Koshi - 10.8MW \n*  Aeolian - 10.8MW Additionally, individuals and private companies own more than 50MW of solar panels and almost 10MW of biofuel installations and the EAC distributes the electricity these produce too. In 2014, the EAC generated a total of 4,013GWh of electricity consuming 916,903 tonnes of fuel costing €446,975,000. Maximum demand in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus reached 871MW, rising to 958MW in 2015. A total of 5.9GWh of the produced electricity in 2014 valued €1,001,000 ended up in the area occupied by Turkey and no money could be collected for it. The Authority served 554,574 customers in 2014, that is 260 per employee, up from 254 in 2013. The electricity sales per employee reached 1.83GWh, up from 1.80GWh in 2013. Company investments in 2014 on its assets reached €39,983,000. On 11 July 2011, a total of 98 containers of munitions stored at Evangelos Florakis Naval Base adjacent to Vasilikos Power Station exploded causing extensive damage to the station. To cope with the extended loss of its largest power station, the Authority had to impose rolling blackouts. In 2010, the maximum demand had reached 1,144MW, the highest ever, and an even higher one was expected in 2011. As a precondition to the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, the local market for electricity generation has been opened to private companies, but so far no private power plants have been built, although four licenses have been granted by Cyprus Energy Regulation Authority. In the meanwhile, the EAC diversified into communication and cable television services in cooperation with a private company. In 2005, the company was involved in a high profile scandal involving the alleged theft of millions of Cyprus pounds from the employees' pension scheme."

  "text" : "East Dawning (Chinese: 东方既白, Dongfang Jibai) is Yum! Brands' fusion of the KFC business model with Chinese cuisine. Chinese food is served exclusively, but the chain focuses on the elements of Chinese cuisine that are more quickly and easily prepared. This excludes some dishes, such as boiled dumplings (jiaozi), but includes steamed pastries such as steamed buns, including the popular xiaolongbao. Soft drinks are eschewed in favor of traditional and modern Chinese drinks such as teas (including milk tea), juices, and soy milk. However, unlike most Chinese fast food, East Dawning uses consistent recipes and preparation methods between restaurants. The restaurants are designed to resemble Chinese homes; for instance, the dining tables are similar to offering tables found in many homes. A test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After the failure of the test restaurant, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success. As of the first quarter of 2013, there are 30 East Dawning restaurants in China. The restaurants are located in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Suzhou."

Its parent company is the Lorain County Printing and Publishing Company, which owns the Chronicle-Telegram of Elyria and Medina County Gazette. The company was founded in 1948 with the establishment of WEOL AM-FM in Elyria, Ohio, the AM station of which continues to serve as the company's flagship. On May 15, 1958, Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co. was purchased by the Lorain County Printing and Publishing Company, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. As LCP&P owned the Chronicle-Telegram (and bought the Gazette in 1962) in effect formed a radio/newspaper duopoly. This arrangement has lasted to this day, grandfathered by FCC legislation that now prohibit such arrangements. Other stations within the chain include the Sandusky/Lake Erie Islands area cluster of WLKR FM 95.3, WLKR AM 1510, and WKFM FM 96.1. Throughout the 1990s, Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting also owned a station in the Mansfield market, WYXZ-FM in Crestline. In 2003, WYXZ was sold off to EMF Broadcasting, which now operates the station as WYKL with their \"K-Love\" religious format. The company also owned WMEL (AM 920, now WDMC) Melbourne (1956 to 1993); WROD-AM 1340 Daytona Beach (1965 to 1982) and WELE-FM 105.9 (now WOCL) DeLand - Daytona Beach - Orlando (1982 to 1986), all in Florida. WEOL-FM in Elyria became WBEA in 1965, then WCZR and WNWV in 1987, and was sold off to the Akron, Ohio-based Rubber City Radio Group, Inc. in December 2011."

An Isilon clustered storage system is composed of three or more nodes. Each node is a self-contained, rack-mountable device that contains industry standard hardware, including disk drives, CPU, memory and network interfaces, and is integrated with proprietary operating system software called OneFS (based on FreeBSD), which unifies a cluster of nodes into a single shared resource. Current Isilon hardware platforms include the S-Series nodes, which support high-performance, process-intensive, high-transaction applications; the X-Series nodes, which support high-throughput and high-concurrency application needs; the NL-Series nearline storage nodes, which support archiving, disaster recovery and disk-to-disk backup needs; and the HD-Series nodes, which support large-scale, high-density deep archive storage needs, as well as disaster recovery and, when combined with other nodes, an enterprise data lake foundation. Isilon also offers A-Series Accelerator nodes, which scale cluster performance and data backup processes."

Later on the Al Juffali group introduced many other fields to Saudi Arabia such as power utilities, construction, insurance, telecommunications, and vehicle manufacturing and distribution. Their joint venture partners include international companies such as, Daimler AG, Bosch, Dow Chemical, Fluor Corp, Carrier, DuPont, Ericsson, IBM, Liebherr, Michelin, Massey Ferguson, Siemens AG, and Nabors Industries. The group's growth was steered in large part by Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdullah Al-Juffali (1924–1994), and his brothers, Ebrahim and Ali. The company was later run by their sons, Sheikh Khaled Juffali and Sheikh Walid Al Juffali (1955-2016).

As of 2012 plans, design and flight safety reviews were planned for 2015.According to a 2012 interview with Art Dula, the chairman of Excalibur Almaz, the Excalibur Almaz capsule was supposedly at a \"very high level of technical readiness\" and could be flown within two to three years. The main issue of the first manned flight of the Excalibur Almaz capsule is regulatory, according to Dula, as the VA capsule had already completed nine unmanned test flights during the Almaz program, all of which were successful.The company has entered into an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development Round 2 (CCDev2) activities in 2011  but was not selected to receive funding under any phases of it."

  "text" : "EA Montreal is a Canadian video game development studio owned and operated by Electronic Arts. The studio is based in Montreal, Québec. It was inaugurated by EA on March 17, 2004. The studio was founded by Alain Tascan a former Ubisoft and BAM! Entertainment executive. It is one of a few examples where EA created a new studio instead of acquiring one. In 2006 with the acquisition of Jamdat, its Montreal offices were moved to the location of EA Montreal studio. EA Montreal and EA Mobile Montreal are operated separately, however. In 2007, following the split of EA development studios into four labels, EA Montreal became part of EA Games Label (Frank Gibeau, President). EA Montreal is responsible for two original franchises: Boogie and Army of Two as well as other titles where it collaborates with other EA studios. The Visceral Montreal studio was closed in February 2013. In April 2012, EA announced layoffs in the Mobile division. A further layoff on the Mobile Division took place in February 2015. In July 2015, EA announced the creation of Motive Studios, a new Montreal-based operation led by Jade Raymond. Motive is co-located at EA Montreal with BioWare, which has maintained a Montreal studio operation under the leadership of studio director Yanick Roy."

Epitome produced two television drama series aimed primarily at the youth and the young-adult market (which was the first DHX Media not to be aimed primarily at the children market). The first was Degrassi: The Next Generation, which is broadcast on MTV and Much (previously CTV) in Canada and TeenNick in the United States, and is licensed to over 150 countries around the world. The other was Instant Star, which was similarly broadcast on CTV and TeenNick, and is licensed to over 120 countries worldwide. Other television series that Epitome or its sister companies have produced in the past include Liberty Street and Riverdale (English Canada's first prime-time soap-opera). Previous incarnations of the Degrassi series including The Kids of Degrassi Street, Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High and the movie-of-the-week School's Out were produced by Playing With Time Inc., a company owned by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood and founded in 1976 which has been inactive since the mid-1990s when Hood and Schuyler ended their partnership (Epitome owns the rights to these series). In April 2014, the company was acquired by fellow Canadian television producer DHX Media."

  "text" : "Eureka Vacuum Cleaner Company was founded in 1909 in Detroit, Mich. by Toronto, Canada-born real estate auctioneer Fred Wardell (1866-1952) to sell vacuum cleaners for which he had acquired several patents. At first only selling vacuum cleaners manufactured by others, in 1913 he and four partners purchased their first plant. In 1922 they introduced the Eureka Model 9, which undercut their main competitor Hoover by 50% in price, with the same horsepower motor and a front-mounted bag that customers preferred to Hoover's rear-mounted bag, offered with a 10-day home trial, becoming the Model T of the vacuum cleaner industry, selling 1 million units in three years. By 1927 Eureka sold 2 million units, selling one-third of all vacuums manufactured in the United States and settling into a perennial second place position behind Hoover. 1930 saw expansion into the making of other appliances with the introduction of the Eureka electric range. Partly due to the costs of a massive door-to-door sales force, along with the Great Depression, in the late 1930s the company went into the red, divesting its door-to-door force in 1940, and still operating in the red until it was saved only by World War II and a wartime production business. In 1945 looking to get into the booming postwar appliance industry, the company merged with Williams Oil-O-Matic, a Bloomington, Ill., manufacturer (founded 1918) of oil-based heaters and refrigerators for the home, and the name of the company was changed to Eureka-Williams Corporation. The company went on to expand its horizons, eventually manufacturing such diverse items as heaters, air conditioners, a wooden lung, and school furniture. In 1953 it was purchased by Henney Motor Company of Freeport, Illinois, and in 1959 it became a division of National Union Electric Corporation, going on in 1961 to become the first U.S. manufacturer of a purpose-built electric car, the Henney Kilowatt, which flopped commercially. In 1974 Eureka was purchased by AB Electrolux of Sweden and the name was changed back to the Eureka Company. In 1993 it had 20% of the $600 million vacuum cleaner market, vs. 35% for Hoover. In 2004 the use of the Eureka company name was discontinued and replaced with Electrolux Home Products Division. In August 2011 Electrolux Small Appliances North America relocated to Charlotte, N.C., from Bloomington, Ill., uniting the corporate office operations and support functions for all of Electrolux's North American vacuum, small appliance, and major appliance brands under one roof."

  "text" : "The Emu Downs Wind Farm (30°30′S 115°20′E﻿ / ﻿30.500°S 115.333°E) is a 79.2 MW wind farm in Western Australia. It was a joint development between Stanwell Corporation and Griffin Energy. The site is approximately 200 kilometres north of Perth, near Cervantes. Construction of the $180 million project commenced in November 2005, and the project was commissioned in October 2006. Emu Downs consists of 48 Vestas wind turbines (each with 1.65 MW generating capacity), a substation, interconnection to the main 132 kV electricity grid, administration and stores buildings, and a network of access roads. The wind farm is close to the coast, with a good quality wind resource that has increased wind speeds and reliability aligning with periods for peak power demand. The wind farm provides electricity to run a desalination plant, 260 km (160 mi) to the south. The Kwinana Desalination Plant, located just south of Perth, turns water from the Indian Ocean into nearly 152 million litres (40 million gallons) of drinking water per day. Emu Downs is accredited under the Australian Government's Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 and as a Green Power Generator by the Sustainable Energy Development Authority. In June 2011, the wind farm was acquired by the APA Group for $170 million from the failed Griffin Group."

  "text" : "Embega, S. Coop. was founded in 1971 by a group of workers from the former household appliance company Agni (today BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeräte GmbH), on the banks of Ega river, in Estella (Navarra, Spain). Since the beginning, Embega was integrated in the Caja Laboral's Enterprise Division, the root with other companies like Fagor, of the Mondragon Corporation. Currently, Embega is integrated in the Components Division of Mondragon. They began their cooperativewith 43 members, specialized in machining, screen-printing and lithographing of metal plates for household appliances, automation and other decorative elements. In 1979, the anodizing and electroplating plant for aluminium profiles, with 120 workers, was started. In 1982 a new product line was created: the Printed Gaskets Division, launched under the name of Egaprint, contributing with sealing solutions to a large range of products and markets. Seven years later, a new activity was launched: HMI Division (Human–machine interface), manufacturing graphic overlays, membrane switches and, later on, metal (anti-vandalism) keyboards. At that time there were about 210 workers on the cooperative staff. At the end of the 1990s, a new domestic appliances component was launched: an air-to-air, heat transfer, water condenser for tumble dryers. In 2006, Embega first subsidiary was established in Poland, due to their position in the white goods market, under the name of Embega Polska, which started its activity in Wroclaw by producing domestic appliance components. In 2008 a new cooperative was established in which Embega took an important share: Soterna, a manufacturer of domestic solar systems. A new product line, natural evolution of membrane switches was started early in 2013: flexible, backlighted, capacitive buttons and keyboards within the HMI division."

  "text" : "The Enron scandal, revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure. Enron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he developed a staff of executives that, by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting, were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues. Enron shareholders filed a $40 billion lawsuit after the company's stock price, which achieved a high of US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 by the end of November 2001. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year. Many executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients."

  "text" : "Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) was a professional wrestling promotion that was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1992 by Tod Gordon. ECW closed when then owner Paul Heyman declared bankruptcy in April 2001. The promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling, ranging from lucha libre to puroresu and hardcore wrestling, and became known for having an intelligent, often rowdy and vocal fanbase that rejected the more cartoonish programming of ECW's competitors. Widely considered the most daring wrestling company, many fans were heartbroken when ECW declared bankruptcy. After purchasing the assets of ECW in 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment relaunched the Extreme Championship Wrestling franchise as a WWE brand with their existing Raw and SmackDown brands. It debuted on June 13, 2006 on Sci Fi in the United States and ran for close to four years until it aired its final episode on February 16, 2010 on the rebranded Syfy. It was replaced the following week with WWE NXT."

The firm began as an importer & distributor of industrial goods for the metal and wood industry. By the 1950s the firm had ventured into other operations including water works, automotive service equipment, and distributing raw materials as supplies for industries in Egypt. In 1976, Dayoub’s three sons – two of them trained mechanical engineers joined the company and expanded its activities. They developed the company into five key areas of production including wood-working machinery, chemicals, automotive service equipment, machine tools and utilities . To further establish its strength in the Egyptian market, EEA has undergone a transition in legal status from a limited proprietorship, to a joint stock company but still centering on the same industrial activity within the market. The Egyptian government and NGO's have recently started a public awareness campaign about emissions and as a result changes to traffic laws have been made to enforce emission testing for vehicles and to decrease emissions. Egyptian Companies such as the Egyptian Engineering Agencies are now importing gas analyzers and smoke meters for the government of Egypt."

  "text" : "Etisalat Egypt is a subsidiary of Etisalat U.A.E., the sole telecommunications services provider in the United Arab Emirates from 1976 until the arrival of Du (telco) in February 2007, and the first 3.5G network operator in Egypt. Etisalat Egypt is one of 15 service providers managed by Etisalat in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Etisalat group currently has access to a potential market of just below 1 billion subscribers and today Etisalat services over 130 million subscribers including the total number of fixed-line, Internet, mobile and television from each of its subsidiaries.In November 2007, Etisalat Egypt upgraded to 3.75G which is the marketing term for HSUPA (High Speed Uplink Packet access). The Uplink channel carries information from the mobile terminal to the network such as file uploading, e-mail attachments and user response in interactive games. HSUPA is an enhancement of 3.5G networks that increases upload speeds. HSDPA stands for High Speed Downlink Packet access. A Downlink channel carries information from the network to the mobile terminal such as video and music downloads. Etisalat Egypt was the first mobile operator in Egypt to offer Downlink speeds up to 7.2 Mbit/s which is two times faster than 3.5G downlink speeds. Today, Etisalat Egypt’s 2G and 3G robust and high quality network covers and serves 99% of the population in Egypt, with download speed reaching up to 84Mbit/s. Moreover, Etisalat Egypt is the first and the only operator in Egypt that has an exclusive international gateway. In order to complete Etisalat Egypt’s product portfolio, two well-established ISPs (Internet Service Providers) were acquired and provide broadband services. The incumbent was bought based on a consortium led by Etisalat U.A.E. in July 2006. The current ownership structure of the company is \n*  Etisalat U.A.E. with a share of 66%  \n*  The Egyptian National Post Authority with a 20% share, \n*  DAS Holdings with a 5% share, \n*  DIFC LLC with a 5% share, \n*  Al Nabodah Investment Company with a 1.5% share, \n*  Technical Investment Company with a 1.5% share \n*  and Mawarid Finance with a 1% share,"

Founded by two brothers from Ohio, the Cowles companies are remembered for producing alloys in quantity sufficient for commerce. Their furnaces were electric arc smelters, one of the first viable methods for extracting metals. The businesses of the era dramatically increased the supply of aluminium, a plentiful resource not found in nature in pure form, and reduced its price. The Cowles process was the immediate predecessor to the Hall-Héroult process—today in nearly universal use more than a century after it was discovered by Charles Martin Hall and Paul Héroult and adapted by others including Carl Josef Bayer. Because of the patent landscape, the Cowles companies found themselves in court. Judges eventually acknowledged their innovations many years after the companies formed, and one brother received two separate settlements."

  "text" : "Electra was a brand of electric guitars and basses manufactured in Japan and distributed in the US by two companies owned by brothers: Saint Louis Music (SLM) and Pacific Coast Music in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2013, the brand launched a successful comeback led by renowned luthiers Ben Chafin and Mick Donner. Unlike most other brands of imported guitars which were sourced from a single manufacturer, Electra guitars were ordered from all the Japanese factories and distributors. As a result, early models especially vary in details and quality. Later, as all models came to be made by Matsumoku, Electra guitars offered high quality at competitive prices. However, the brand never entirely lost its association with inexpensive 'copy' guitars and the brand name was transitioned to Electra Westone in 1984 and Westone in 1985. The same qualities make them popular among collectors today. In 2013 Ben Chafin, former head luthier at Dean Guitars, acquired the rights to Electra Guitars and is now producing new Electra Guitars. The first model available was a reissued and updated single cutaway Electra Omega, followed by the Omega Prime. After rave reviews and a growing roster of artist endorsements, Electra Guitars unveiled a number of new models in 2014 including the Invicta, Talon, Phoenix H & S Guitars and the Phoenix Bass. More about the current company and their guitars, basses, accessories and merchandise can be found at their official website Electra Guitars"

  "text" : "EXTOL International Inc. is the largest technology firm in the city of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, employing over 90 technology professionals in the field of electronic data interchange (EDI) and business-to-business (B2B) data integration. It has also been named one of the top private companies in the Lehigh Valley, and one of the top 500 technology firms in the United States. EXTOL was incorporated in 1989 by Joe Baran and Tony Baran, who at the time, recognized the need for companies throughout the supply chain to comply with EDI mandates. They created EDI integration software that ran on the IBM AS/400 platform (IBM System i), which today, remains one of the last IBM-based EDI integration products actively being developed and supported. In 2006, EXTOL publicly released the next generation of its EDI integration software, EXTOL Business Integrator (EBI), which allowed companies to exchange EDI through multiple platforms, including Linux and Windows. EBI expanded enterprise data integration capabilities beyond traditional EDI to include other data file tips such as XML, spreadsheets, flat files, and application-to-application (A2A) data. By the start of 2012, EXTOL had grown their customer base by 750 companies and had realized record-breaking sales revenues. The continued need for EDI and B2B integration solutions across the supply chain helped EXTOL develop significant software releases, and by the end of 2015, had increased market share by 26.9%. In 2016, EXTOL was acquired by Illinois-based Cleo, an enterprise software company that provides electronic data interchange, and application-to-application, business-to-business, and big data integration services to organizations with managed file transfer needs. The Pottsville, PA office will operate under the Cleo name."

  "text" : "Eat Sleep Play, Inc. is an American video game developer, formed by Scott Campbell and David Jaffe, director of the Twisted Metal series and God of War. Eat Sleep Play entered into an exclusive platform deal with Sony requiring the completion of either three console/handheld games or three years of development time, with plans to release its first original game in 2010. The first game released by Eat Sleep Play was a port of the PSP game Twisted Metal: Head On that was retitled as Twisted Metal Head-On: Extra Twisted Edition for PlayStation 2 and was not one of the three game console exclusive deal. Following his work on Sony Computer Entertainment Santa Monica's God of War (PS2), Scott and Jaffe expressed a desire to focus on smaller-scale, more personal games. They then directed the PlayStation Network game Calling All Cars! (PS3), developed by Incognito. The company is stationed in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The team is largely composed of original members of SingleTrac who made the first two Twisted Metal games. During E3 2010 Scott and Jaffe announced the new Twisted Metal game that their team was working on at Eat Sleep Play. The announcement can be read over at the PlayStation Blog. Since Jaffe's resignation in 2012, Eat Sleep Play has moved into mobile game development. In partnership with Zynga the companies have released Running With Friends, Looney Tunes Dash!, and most recently Ice Age Arctic Blast."

  "text" : "Meson Sandwiches is a fast-casual restaurant chain that primarily sells sandwiches, salads and breakfast items, which it serves all day long. Based in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico El Meson Sandwiches is Puerto Rico’s largest restaurant chain. In 2012 it was named one of the world’s top fast food chains by Travel & Leisure magazine. El Meson Sandwiches is family owned and operated. It has 37 locations in Puerto Rico and one in Orlando, Florida in Florida Mall which opened in June 2015. The company plans to open four more locations in Orlando by 2017  including one in Kissimmee at The Crossing shopping center which will open by the end of 2015. El Meson plans to begin franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million. Products El Meson sandwiches are mostly served on criollo bread, a sweet, French-style bread with a Caribbean flavor. Most are pressed on a hot grill and served with cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes. History The first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico’s northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe Pérez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere. Many of El Meson’s early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed. About Felipe Pérez Grajales Felipe Pérez Grajales is the current CEO of El Meson Sandwiches. He was born in 1965, the eldest of three brothers. From the early 1970s through his high school years, Grajales worked in the original El Meson restaurant in Aguadilla. In 1983 he left Puerto Rico to attend Jacksonville University. Though he received several offers from companies in the U.S., he returned to Puerto Rico in 1986 to help expand the family business. Grajales has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by Ernst & Young, the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, the Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) Association, and the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico. He was president of the Organizing Committee for the XXI Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez in 2010 and is president of the Mayagüez 2010 Foundation."

  "text" : "Ephraim Faience Pottery is an art pottery company founded in 1996 in Deerfield, Wisconsin, United States by Kevin Hicks and two partners who have since left the company. It is now located in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. The company produces art pottery in the tradition of the Arts and Crafts Movement with matte glazes over sculpted earthenware in editions of no more than 500 pieces. It produces primarily vases, as well as bowls, lidded boxes, candleholders, pitchers and lanterns. In the past, it has also produced tiles and sculpted paperweights. A prototypical Ephraim Faience piece is a vase finished in a matte green background color, and embellished with sculpted decorative representations of plant or animal life. The company also produces pieces in other colors and in non-representational designs. In 2009, the company employed eight artisans. The magazine Arts and Crafts Homes and the Revival commented \"Ephraim Faience, which relies on familiar naturalistic (and often Japanesque) motifs like dragonflies, gingko leaves, and water lilies, reports that new designs by their artisans sell better than strict reproductions.\" The name \"Ephraim\" was adopted from the village of Ephraim in Door County, Wisconsin."

  "text" : "Eden Foods, Inc., (also known as Eden Organic) is an organic food company in the United States. It is best known for its Edensoy line of organic soy milk, and its line of organic Japanese foods and condiments. The company claims to be the oldest independent organic food producer in the United States, and the largest supplier of organic dry grocery items. Eden was founded in 1969 as a co-op grocery store in Ann Arbor, Michigan to continue the operations of a defunct macrobiotic food buying club. Originally incorporated as a nonprofit, it became a for-profit company in 1970. In 1972, the company began importing Japanese foods such as miso and soy sauce for both the retail and commercial markets. Many of Eden's Japanese foods are still sourced in Japan. Most of Eden Food's products are organic, most are certified kosher, and all of Eden Foods' products are also vegan, except for their katsuo (Japanese fish flakes). Many of Eden's prepared foods are also gluten-free, and have therefore been recommended for those on a gluten-free or gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet"

  "text" : "Education Management Corporation (\"EDMC\") is a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based operator of for-profit post-secondary educational institutions in the United States and Canada. The company was founded in 1962. Education Management Corporation has operated 110 schools through its four higher education divisions: Argosy University, The Art Institutes, Brown Mackie College and South University. Current enrollment is unknown, though many Brown Mackie Colleges and Art Institutes schools are in the process of closing.  Enrollment for 2014 stood at 120,920. According to EDMC, student enrollment was projected to decline to 109,890 in 2015. In 2011, EDMC and its subsidiary, the Art Institutes, received greater public scrutiny with the release of the Frontline documentary: Educating Sergeant Pantzke. In the documentary, Iraq war veteran Chris Pantzke discussed the lack of disability services at the school. According to Pantzke, \"Being a soldier, you don’t want to quit, you don’t want to give up or fail.\" But after doing his own research, Pantzke concluded that the degree he was pursuing wasn’t \"worth much more than the paper is worth\". And he felt he was \"throwing away taxpayer money” by using GI Bill funds. Todd S. Nelson, who was previously the CEO of Apollo Education Group, became a became the CEO in 2007 and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2012. From June 2013 to June 2014, the company eliminated about 2,600 positions, and campuses have been closed or are in the process of closing. EDMC has faced significant financial problems, including a 99.9% drop in the value of its stock and a defaulted bond rating (to junk bond status). Under a pending agreement, shareholder stock value will be diluted an additional 96%. Moody's credit rating service in January 2015 dropped EDMC to its lowest rating, D-PD. EDMC's CEO, Edward West, resigned from the company on August 28, 2015, \"to pursue other interests\". The company was never profitable under his leadership. EDMC was delisted from the NASDAQ in November 2014 EDMC has been the subject of several lawsuits and investigations alleging that the company made misleading claims in its efforts to recruit students. On November 16, 2015, federal and state authorities announced a $95.5-million settlement resolving a whistleblower case in which former EDMC employees said the company was \"illegally paying recruiters based on the number of students they enrolled.\" As of 2016, EDMC announced that it was planning to close 19 of its Art Institute campuses and 22 of 26 Brown Mackie College campuses."

  "text" : "EcoSecurities is a business that sources and develops carbon credits and carbon offsets from greenhouse gas emission reduction projects throughout the world. The company has offices in Europe, Middle East, Americas and Asia and has a large portfolio of green house gas emission reduction projects covering numerous countries and technologies. EcoSecurities was created in January 1997, 12 months before the Kyoto conference. After a period of organic growth, the company floated on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange in December 2005, allowing it to grow its geographic presence by placing over 300 staff in 30 countries. Its portfolio grew to over 150 million CERs - the largest in the world at the time. In June 2007, the company raised an additional €100 million to expand into new markets, with Credit Suisse becoming a major investor. It trades in the international carbon market which was valued at €38 billion in the first six months of 2008. The former President and co-founder of EcoSecurities was Pedro Moura-Costa and the former CEO was Bruce Usher. At the end of 2009 the firm was acquired by JP Morgan and is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiarly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. and can provide its clients with access to the scope of services provided by the bank's Environmental Markets business in addition to those activities of sourcing and developing greenhouse gas abatement projects outlined above. Following on from acquisition of EcoSecurities the company appointed Paul Mark Kelly as Chief Executive Officer of the company in December 2009, when the company subsequently delisted from the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange."

  "text" : "Ektelon, Inc. is an American manufacturer of equipment for racquetball. Currently based in Bordentown, New Jersey, Ektelon was founded by Franklin W. \"Bud\" Held in 1964 as the first company to manufacture racquetball racquets and stringing machines, not long after the development of the sport of racquetball by Joe Sobek. Working from Held’s garage in San Diego, California, the company initially set out to build aluminum tennis racquets and a racquet stringing machine. With the development of metal tennis racquets, the old techniques of stringing wooden racquets no longer worked, and Held saw the need for a new machine. Held is credited for one of the first patented designs for a racquet stringing machine. He named the company Ektelon based on a combination of two Greek words: \"ektein\", meaning to stretch out, and \"telon\", representing the concept of perfection. In 1970, Ektelon produced the first experimental racquetball racquet for Bud Muehleisen, a top racquetball player and early legend of the sport. The company moved into a larger facility in San Diego to begin manufacturing racquetball racquets on a larger scale. Over the years, Ektelon has introduced a number of new racquetball technologies, including the first racquetball racquet made of high-strength aluminum (1971), the first handlaid composite racquet (1978), the first oversized aluminum racquets (1984), and continues to develop new technologies in racquet design such as the elimination of string holes (O3). In 1988, Prince Sports purchased Ektelon."

  "text" : "Exxon Mobil Corp. (ExxonMobil) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is the largest direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, and was formed on November 30, 1999 by the merger of Exxon (formerly Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (formerly the Standard Oil Company of New York). The world's 8th largest company by revenue, ExxonMobil is also the fifth largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The company was ranked No. 6 globally in Forbes Global 2000 list in 2014. ExxonMobil was the second most profitable company in the Fortune 500 in 2014. ExxonMobil is the largest of the world's supermajors with daily production of 3.921 million BOE. In 2008, this was approximately 3 percent of world production, which is less than several of the largest state-owned petroleum companies. When ranked by oil and gas reserves, it is 14th in the world—with less than 1 percent of the total. ExxonMobil's reserves were 25.2 billion BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) at the end of 2013 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years. With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels (1,000,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the largest refiner in the world, a title that was also associated with Standard Oil since its incorporation in 1870. ExxonMobil has been criticized for its slow response to cleanup efforts after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, widely considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment. ExxonMobil has a history of lobbying for climate change denial and against the idea that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The company has also been the target of accusations of improperly dealing with human rights issues, influence on American foreign policy, and its impact on the future of nations."

  "text" : "eCourier is a UK courier service. Courier positions are tracked by GPS and an intelligent despatch system assigns orders via GPRS, improving efficiency in a traditional industry. A computer algorithm distributes orders to couriers in real time based on location, traffic, weather and demand. The algorithm was developed by a team of academics in Italy. The company stores the historical GPS positions of its couriers, and uploads this information to OpenStreetMap. This information is also offered to the public via an API under a Creative Commons license. As of October 2008, their data set included over 252 million historical positions. The company was founded by Tom Allason and Jay Bregman after event tickets were lost by a motorcycle courier. The business won Allason recognition as a Growing Business Top Gun 2007 and Bregman from the British Computer Society as 2005 IT Director of the Year. Investors in the company include Esther Dyson and Stuart Wheeler. Venture Capital firm Logispring also owned a minority stake in the company. In 2007 the company won the Evening Standard’s Most Inspirational Business award. In 2008 Allason left the company to pursue a new venture  and the following year launched Shutl. In 2009 eCourier reached 6 on Deloitte’s list of UK’s 50 fastest growing technology businesses. and 53 on the Sunday Times Tech Track list of Britain's fastest-growing private technology companies. In 2011 to 2012 eCourier revenues were flat and the business was put up for sale. In 2012, eCourier was acquired by Courier Systems, the trading name of Revisecatch Limited. This acquisition brought together the experience, expertise and knowledge of Courier Systems and the technology and dynamism of eCourier, which turned out to be a good fit for both businesses. In 2013, eCourier (UK) Ltd changed its name to KANDYSYSTEMS LTD and was put into voluntary liquidation. Revisecatch Limited  now uses the eCourier trading name for all of its courier business and has phased out the use of the Courier Systems name. eCourier now has one of the largest and most recognisable courier fleets in London and the South."

On January 12, 2014 on their web page Epik Subwoofer announced that after 7 years in business they would be closing operations. Their explanation was that they had had increasing difficulty with vendors’ unreliable timelines and broken commitments for components and parts. They were perhaps best known for their development of the Conquest subwoofer. \"The uniformity of the Conquest's dynamic capability exceeds that of any commercial product Tom Nousaine has ever measured.\" Epik, company ran by owner Chad Kuypers, closed its doors in 2014. During the companies run they sold subwoofers Internet direct and received praise from users and professional reviewers for their price to performance ratio. Before officially closing their doors Epik launched the Legend and Empire, both dual opposed sealed sub woofers, 12\" and 15\" respectively. Due to poor quality control and high volume of returns caused by amp failures, owner Chad decided to close his doors. The buyers who had purchased Epik sub woofers with faulty amplifiers, some not older than a month, were left to find a solution on their own after spending $1,000 on what they believed would be a high end piece of home theater equipment. Epik was a failure and put a stain on the trust Internet direct speaker companies have worked hard to build. Below is one example of an owner out their hard earned money after an Epik amp caught fire. Epik amp catches fire"

  "text" : "The Etna Iron Works (sometimes rendered as Ætna Iron Works) was a 19th-century ironworks and manufacturing plant for marine steam engines located in New York City. The Etna Works was a failing small business when purchased by ironmolder John Roach and three partners in 1852. Roach soon gained full ownership of the business and quickly transformed it into a successful general-purpose ironworks. Roach took advantage of the American Civil War to transform the Etna Works into one of New York's leading manufacturers of marine steam engines. By the end of the war, he was in a position to acquire the businesses of most of his major New York competitors, who had fallen on hard times. Roach subsequently consolidated his operations at the Morgan Iron Works, and some time afterward rented the Etna Works to the inventor Thomas Edison, who turned it into a dynamo factory. The Roach family sold the former Etna Works property in 1887. The Etna Works buildings, along with the street on which they were located, were later liquidated in a city redevelopment. Notable achievements of the Etna Iron Works include the building of the steam-operated Third Avenue Harlem Bridge in 1864, and the manufacture in the 1860s of the engines for the giant ironclad USS Dunderberg and for the passenger steamers Bristol and Providence, the latter two of which were the largest marine engines built in the United States to that date."

  "text" : "Exact Editions is an integrated content management platform for magazine publishers. It was launched in 2005 by Adam Hodgkin, Daryl Rayner and Tim Bruce. Initially available as a web-based subscription service, the platform has expanded into developing iOS apps for Apple’s Newsstand. Exact Editions’ branded iOS apps are based on the freemium model, and offer subscriptions via in-app purchase. Branded apps developed through Exact Editions allow users to sync issues for offline use, share app content via social media and email, and bookmark pages to return to. The platform offers subscriptions to individuals and to institutions, as well as several titles in French and Spanish. Exact Editions is unlike many other digital solutions for magazines in focusing firmly on a subscription model for access. In this the model is more like that of Netflix or Spotify than iTunes. In 2009, Exact Editions launched an Android app called ‘Exactly’, which offers access to all titles. In 2012, they began offering publishers the additional option to offer apps on the Kindle Fire through the Amazon app store. In 2012, Exact Editions launched its first complete digital archive for Gramophone magazine, offering subscribers access to 90 years’ worth of back issues (1,000 issues in total). Since then, Dazed & Confused’s 20 year archive and The Wire’s 30 year archive have also been released. The company recently rolled out a geo-location feature called ByPlace™ across their iOS apps. This capability allows publishers to make their iTunes app freely available from a specific place, or several places, for a specified period of time, by specifying the geo-coordinates. Exact Editions’ titles span a variety of subjects (news, music, technology, sport) and varying frequencies of publication (weekly, monthly, quarterly)."

The Company provided electric vehicle infrastructure products and solutions that are used in on-road, grid-connected vehicles (including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles), material handling and airport electric ground support applications. Through its main operating subsidiary, Electric Transportation Engineering Corporation (eTec), the Company’s primary product offering was the Minit-Charger line of advanced battery fast-charge systems that are designed for various motive applications. In addition to its electric transportation focus, Ecotality, Inc. was also involved in the development, manufacture, assembly and sale of specialty solar products, advanced battery systems, and hydrogen and fuel cell systems. Its subsidiaries and primary operating segments consisted of eTec, Innergy Power Corporation (Innergy), and ECOtality Stores (doing business as Fuel Cell Store). On September 16, 2013 it filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. In October 2013 the Car Charging Group announced that it had purchased Ecotality's Blink network of charging stations for $3.3 million. Two Ecotality branches—Minit-Charger and Etec Labs—were not included in the purchase: Minit-Charger manufactures quick-charging systems for commercial applications, and Etec Labs conducts tests for the government and OEMs. They were purchased by Access Control and Intertek, respectively."

  "text" : "Electric Factory Concerts is the name of a longtime Philadelphia-based concert promotion firm, affiliated with the Electric Factory venue in that city. It was originally founded by Herbert Spivak, who ultimately ran the business with his brothers Jerry Spivak and Allen Spivak. They later hired Larry Magid to become General Manager, and he also became a co-owner of the company. Its first concert staging was on February 2, 1968, at the old Electric Factory and featured The Chambers Brothers. It survived the closing of the original Electric Factory venue and went on to prosper. It became prominent in promoting concerts at all venues in the Philadelphia area, including many at the Philadelphia Spectrum. In late 1975, Electric Factory Concerts bought the Tower Theater from its owner Midnight Sun. About a year later, Midnight Sun commenced an anti-trust action against Electric Factory and its secret concert partner, Spectrum Corporation, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The suit dragged on for several years and was eventually settled for approximately $1 million, as reported in Rolling Stone and the Philadelphia newspapers. A later anti-trust suit by rock promoter Stephen Starr against Electric Factory Concerts was also settled for the same amount in 1990, which then financed Starr's rise as a star in the restaurant industry. The firm gained national renown. It played a role in staging 1985's Live Aid and 2005's Live 8 concert, Philadelphia. Electric Factory Concerts remains the dominant Philadelphia concert promoter, though the brand is now owned by Live Nation Entertainment. The International Association of Theatrical Stage Employees, Local 8 has called for a boycott of all Electric Factory Concert events, stating that the promoter \"(undermines) the area standard.\""

Oster claims that the ET3 system will be able to provide 50 times the amount of transportation per kilowatt-hour compared with electric cars and electric trains, costing only 20 cents worth of electrical energy to get up to 350 mph. ET3 claims that initial systems would travel at the speed of 600 km/h (370 mph) for in state trips, and later will be developed to 6,500 km/h (4,000 mph, hypersonic speed) for international travel that will allow passenger or cargo travel from New York to Beijing in 2 hours. The initial proof of concept system could be built in as little 3 years for operational transport."

  "text" : "Electric Aircraft Corporation is an American aircraft manufacturer that was founded by Randall Fishman, a retired New Jersey jeweler. The company is based in Cliffside Park, New Jersey and specializes in the design and manufacture of electric aircraft under the ElectraFlyer brand name. The company's first product was the Electric Aircraft Corporation ElectraFlyer Trike, an ultralight trike powered by an in-house designed electric motor and battery pack. The company then started selling power train components to convert existing ultralights to electric power. The single-seat ElectraFlyer-C followed, using the same 18 hp (13 kW) electric motor and a converted Monnett Moni motorglider airframe. The company is currently developing a new design intended for production, an all composite electric aircraft, the ElectraFlyer-X. In 2008 Fishman won the August Raspet Memorial Award for his electric aircraft work. The award recognizes the \"person who has made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of light aircraft design\" each year. The late 2000s recession caused development of the company products to be delayed. In 2011 Fishman said, \"The recession has made this not a great business right now. I have done okay because I have kept it small, selling a few complete trikes and many propulsion kits, meters and electronic controllers for people to modify their own ultralights.\" The company has the rights to develop the electric powered version of the Airsport Song."

The region contains one of the world's largest copper-cobalt deposits.Through Liontown Resources Limited and Alturas Minerals Corp., the company has gold and copper-gold exploration interests in Peru and Australia.The Lumwana project which has enough reserves to be productive for 37 years, cost the company one billion dollars to develop.In Zambia it has been credited with supporting social development through projects which aim to build schools, attract professionals to areas around its mine sites. 2010 copper production was 323.4 million pounds (146,690 tonnes) 68% higher than in 2009 (192.1 million pounds). Equinox production represents half of parent company Barrick Gold's copper production. The company produces slightly more copper than it sells (In 2010 323.4 vs 290.2 million pounds up from 2009 when it was 290.42 vs 179.72 million pounds), 77% of production occurred during the first nine months of the year (production was 113 kt, sales were 98kt); capital expenditure amounted to $66 million. In September 2010 company debt was $433 million, long term debt fell significantly in the last quarter of 2010 from $422 million down to $295.57 million. Even though Equinox doesn't produce gold Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold company (both in terms of reserves and production) acquired Equinox Minerals in April 2011; the deal will lower the fraction of revenue Barrick receives from the sale of gold to 80%."

  "text" : "Elia is Belgium's transmission system operator (TSO) for high-voltage electricity (30,000-380,000 volts). The company transmits electricity from generators to distribution system operators, who then supply SMEs and homes. Elia also has contracts with a number of major industrial users who are directly connected to its high-voltage grid. Elia's main activities include managing grid infrastructure (maintaining and developing high-voltage installations), managing the electrical system (monitoring flows, maintaining the balance between electricity consumption and generation 24/7, importing and exporting to and from neighbouring countries) and facilitating the market (developing services and mechanisms with a view to developing the electricity market at national and European level). European Directive 96/92/EC on the liberalisation of the electricity market was implemented at federal level through the law of 29 April 1999 on the organisation of the electricity market. Elia was established on 28 June 2001 by merging the Company for the Coordination of the Generation and Transmission of Electrical Energy (CPTE) with the Electrabel entity managing the 30-380 kV grid, and in 2002 it was appointed transmission system operator, in accordance with the Electricity Act of 29 April 1999. Elia has been listed on the stock exchange since June 2005 and in the BEL20 since 2012. In 2010, Elia and Industry Funds Management acquired one of the four German transmission system operators, 50Hertz Transmission, which operates in northern and eastern Germany. This move made the Elia Group one of Europe's five biggest transmission system operators. Elia Group also offers consulting and engineering services through its subsidiary Elia Grid International (EGI), founded in 2014."

HRH Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands opened the conference and the State Secretary for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands, Mr. J. Dzsingisz Gabor, formally announced ECNC’s establishment: “For European cooperation, the exchange of information and expertise is crucial. There are still many gaps to be bridged in connecting the different fragments of information and expertise. There are many networks to be built or strengthened in Europe. In order to meet this requirement, a private foundation and an international network of well-established institutes have taken the initiative to set up the European Centre for Nature Conservation (ECNC) in Tilburg, the Netherlands.”"

It is one of nine air ambulances plus Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, located in North Carolina, and serves a radius of 230 nautical miles (430 km; 260 mi) around Greenville without refueling. Dave Thomson is the current Medical Director for Vidant EastCare and Scott Sampey is the Program Director. Vidant EastCare can be dispatched for a number of causes, including: trauma, burn, neonatal, high risk pregnancy, hyperbaric medicine, stroke and myocardial infarction. Vidant EastCare is most often sent for cardiac patients, followed by trauma, pediatric and neonatal patients. The only air crash occurred on January 8, 1987 when everyone on board perished. In January 2012, Vidant Medical Transport changed its name from EastCare as part of a system wide renaming initiative. In October 2014, Vidant Medical Transport became Vidant EastCare, as it has long been associated with quality and service. Vidant Health is a coordinated system of care serving a 29-county region that's committed to creating access to high-quality care, providing exceptional experiences and the best-possible outcomes. Vidant EastCare is the advanced critical care transport service that delivers on that commitment on the road and in the sky when it matters most."

  "text" : "Excel Communications was founded in 1988 by Dallas entrepreneur Kenny Troutt as a long distance reseller in the US telecom sector at the birth of telecom deregulation. It began selling franchises using a multi-level marketing (MLM) business model, eventually selling over 200,000 of these franchises, or an average of 1 franchise for each 20 customers. In seven years, it became the fourth-largest long distance carrier in America and the youngest billion-dollar-annual company in history (8 years as compared to the second fastest growing, Microsoft, which took 15 years). On May 10, 1996, Excel became the youngest company ever to join the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), trading under the symbol (ECI). The ceremonial honor of ringing the opening bell was afforded to Kenny Troutt as the company he founded began its first day of public trading, with an offering of 11.5 million shares of common stock. In June 1997, Excel acquired Telco Communications Group, one of the nation's 10 largest long-distance phone companies with its own nationwide fiber-optic network. Before the purchase, Excel had to resell long distance service through other companies networks, such as Frontier Communications. In November 1998, Excel merged with Teleglobe. Kenny Troutt retired as CEO on September 20, 1999 and was replaced by Christina Gold. Excel had entered the local phone service market more aggressively than smaller competitors such as MCI. The gross margins associated with long-distance telephone service dropped precipitously during the period from 1998 through 2003 due to the entry of numerous competitors and additional line capacity. The profitability of Excel and almost every other telecommunications firm dependent upon long-distance calling dropped precipitously. Excel/Teleglobe was taken over by Teleglobe's major share holder, Bell Canada. Bell Canada then demoted Excel separately to a subsidiary and eventually spun it off to a private company, VarTec Communications, which required FTC approval to return to the private sector. After approval, VarTec continued the network marketing business model. On November 1, 2004, VarTec Communications (the parent corporation of Excel) unexpectedly filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Excel sought to be released from its contracts with its independent representatives. This allowed it to continue to receive revenue from its large base of installed customers without paying eternal commissions to the franchisees. Excel continued to operate but ceased to be a multi-level marketing company. Although the change created much cash enabling it to pay creditors, it was seen as shortsighted by the franchisee association because it removed the primary source of sales and customer loyalty. In September 2005 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the transfer of licenses to Comtel Telecom Assets, LLP and on June 12, 2006 the company emerged from bankruptcy under its new ownership, announcing a return to a slightly revised version of its former name, Excel Telecom. On March 16, 2010, Matrix Business Technologies announced it would acquire the customers and substantially all the assets of Comtel Telecom Assets, LLP."

  "text" : "Egyptian Regulatory Reform and Development Activity (ERRADA) is an Egyptian initiative to support the government’s efforts to build a regulatory management system to review and streamline business related regulations. The Initiative was officially launched in 2008 by Ministerial Decree No. 1089/2008, which stipulated that it operates under the Sub-cabinet Committee for the Productive Sector. In March 2011, Prime Minister Decision 436/2011 assigned oversight of ERRADA to the Sub-cabinet Committee for Monitoring Economic Performance, chaired by the Minister of Finance. ERRADA seeks to contribute to the implementation of reform plans adopted by the government since 2004 through the review of business related regulations and issue recommendations to enhance business environment by resolving the following issues:multiplicity of complex overlapping regulations; no clarity of valid regulations; absence of a system to identify implicitly repealed decrees; overlap of authorities issuing regulations; inconsistency in regulation drafting cycle across ministries; lack of specific mechanism to study the economic impact of new regulations. Vision Enhance business environment through better regulations. Mission Support government efforts to build a regulatory management system, based on a dialog between public and private institutions, aimed at increasing efficiency, competitiveness and creating more job opportunities. Objectives 1. Identify all valid business related regulations through inventory. 2. Streamline business related regulations through review of inventory, in consultation with different segments of society (government, private sector and civil society). 3. Make all business related regulations accessible to the public through an electronic registry. 4. Seek to introduce regulatory impact assessment (RIA), in order to lay down the foundation for principles of transparency and decision making based on analysis. In the initial stage, 11 ministries (Administrative Development, Agriculture, Finance, Health, Housing, Investment, Local Development, Petroleum, Tourism, Trade and Industry and Transport) joined the Initiative. A pilot was also launched in the Governorates of Cairo, Red Sea, and Alexandria to compile and review business related regulations. To date, ERRADA have identified more than 37,000 regulations that affect business environment in Egypt and entered them on ERRADA electronic database. Within the framework of cooperation with international organizations, which seek to support national reform efforts in Egypt, ERRADA has received since its inception technical and financial assistance from USAID and SIGMA, OECD/EU through:workshops to raise capacity of staff in the Initiative;study tours to countries that have undergone regulatory reform and/or administrative simplification, such as Croatia, Moldova, Turkey and Ireland;hosting international experts to learn about experiences of other countries in enhancing business environment through regulatory reform;providing equipment to facilitate the work of ERRADA. SIGMA undertook a mission during the period 24–27 May 2009 to assess ERRADA and. The mission completed its report in July 2009, in which it commended ERRADA on its effort and provided recommendations to contribute to developing the framework for institutionalizing the Initiative in order to create an effective regulatory management system in Egypt.. ERRADA’s efforts towards achieving regulatory reform in Egypt have been subject to scrutiny in the Fifth Dimension of the OECD’s Business Climate Development strategy (BCDS) Phase 1: Policy Assessment. The BCDS, which draws upon OECD’s tools and guidelines, aims to support individual countries in improving their business climate by assessing investment-related policy reforms. According to BCDS, ERRADA has generally attained positive results while still at an early stage, as it has successfully met its key targets of implementation of inventory, review and depository phases. It commends ERRADA for its strategy, which it describes as follows:\"Egypt’s ERRADA strategy is well-structured, benefiting from international expertise in regulatory reform and generous technical assistance from donor institutions (USAID, CIDA/IDRC, and the IFC). Egypt has built its ERRADA strategy on good practices from other emerging markets undergoing fast-paced regulatory reform.\" (page 14 )"

The company was founded in 2000, when entrepreneur Daniel Broch bought the original Everyman Cinema in Hampstead, which dated to 1933. Broch led the growth of the company with the acquisition in 2008 of Screen Cinemas to add more locations. This coincided with Broch selling a majority stake in the enlarged company, though he remains a shareholder. Following the acquisition, the group has refurbished or plans to refurbish a number of cinemas. Those already refurbished include Walton, Belsize Park, Baker Street, and The Screen On The Green in Islington. Everyman's cinemas have one to five screens, a small number of which offer 3D. Everyman Cinemas offer a programme of films and special events, including the Metropolitan Opera from New York and the National Theatre (in selected cinemas), live Q&As, film festivals and seasons. The venues each feature a licensed bar, food, digital projection and surround sound technology. The group are extending their operating area and have opened cinemas in northern England. The first of these opened in Leeds in April 2013 as part of the Trinity Leeds development in the city centre and a second opened within The Mailbox in Birmingham on 27 February 2015. A further cinema is due to open in Harrogate in September 2016. In April 2015, the company reached an agreement to buy four cinemas from its larger rival Odeon for £7.1 million. In August 2013, The Guardian reported that the entire non-management staff of about 100 are employed on zero-hour contracts, earning just above the minimum wage, and without any guaranteed set hours each week. An Everyman staff member told the Guardian: \"Our zero-hour contracts and low wages mean that affording basic necessities is becoming impossible. We work almost full-time, yet have no security, sick pay or benefits. Our customers are paying more and more for cinema tickets, but the company does everything it can to keep the cost of their staff as low as possible. It's not interested in the hardship this causes.\" The Everyman Media Group made its début on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on 7 November 2013."

  "text" : "Eisner & Iger was a comic book \"packager\" that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium during the late-1930s and 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Many of comic books' most significant creators, including Jack Kirby, entered the field through its doors. The company, formally titled the Eisner and Iger Studio, was also known as Syndicated Features Corporation. Will Eisner, in a 1997 interviewed, referred to the company as both \"Eisner & Iger\" and the \"Art Syndication Company\". It existed from 1936–1939. In addition to comic books, the company also sold color comic strips, such as Adventures of the Red Mask and Pop's Night Out, to newspapers. Its origin has been recounted by its namesakes, Will Eisner and Jerry Iger, in highly different ways, each given below, in alphabetical order. Eisner & Iger was formed to service the emerging market for American comic books, which had originated in the early 1930s as tabloid-sized magazines that reprinted newspaper comic strips, adding color to black-and-white daily comics. By 1935, sporadic new material was beginning to be created for them. One such seminal comic book, Wow, What a Magazine! was edited by Samuel Maxwell \"Jerry\" Iger, a former cartoonist. Wow, which folded after issue #4 (Nov. 1936), brought Iger together with a 19-year-old Will Eisner – the future creator of The Spirit and some of the earliest and most influential graphic novels – who wrote and drew the adventure feature \"Scott Dalton\", the pirate feature \"The Flame\", and the secret agent feature \"Harry Karry\" for Wow."

  "text" : "ELEVEN, LLC is a product development studio with offices in Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, New York. The studio was founded in 1996 by Ben Beck, Dave Harting, Doug Marsden and Glen Walter. Since then the company has designed products and experiences across multiple categories: from consumer goods and housewares, to electronics, medical machinery, sporting goods, and furniture. The company has between 11 and 20 employees providing services including Industrial Design, Mechanical Engineering, Communication Design, Business Strategy, and Design Research. The company has developed an unusual business model, in which the traditional fee for service work is supplemented with licensing and royalties-driven work. The studio has licensed a wide range of its own consumer products. Much of their early licensing work was for products in the pet industry. Working with Aspen Pets, the company designed the walkabout retractable dog leash. Later, the company designed Petmate cat litter boxes such as the Clean Step Litter Box, which is enclosed to prevent the cat from trailing litter out of the box and to provide added privacy for the pet. They developed Burton’s snowboarding step-in boot technology, SI and PSI, when the company was emerging as an early leader in equipment for the sport. Since designing the SI line, ELEVEN has continued to work with Burton on their binding designs, and provided periodic platform overhaul. The company teamed up with STX Lacrosse to design a Gary Gait signature line. The company also designed OXO's barware line, incorporating the Good Grips technology into drinking paraphernalia. The studio has worked with Procter & Gamble on household products and strategic brand innovation for brands including Cascade, Gillette, Secret, Duracell, Febreze, Tide, Vicks, Mr. Clean, Folgers and Sunny D."

  "text" : "Eio Books is an American-based small press publishing house founded in 2004 in the city of Brattleboro, Vermont. In 2011, it opened a second office in Ross, California. Begun by Sydney Longfellow and Ki Longfellow, it is primarily known for the 2005 publication of Longfellow’s novel, The Secret Magdalene, an exploration of the mystery of gnosis told through an interpretation of the life of Mary Magdalene. Eio Books established itself through the success of its first publication. Ki Longfellow is the author of a number of books published by Harper Collins and Doubleday. The first in her Eio Books published trilogy of gnosis, The Secret Magdalene enjoyed instant acclaim and was then purchased and republished by Crown Publishing Group, the historical division of Random House. It has also been optioned by Nancy Savoca for a feature film now in active preproduction. Eio Books has also published the second in Longfellow’s trilogy: Flow Down Like Silver: Hypatia of Alexandria (2009), and in February 2011, it offered Twinka Thiebaud’s intimate memoir of Henry Miller and his table talk, What Doncha Know? about Henry Miller. This book contains not only Thiebaud’s musings on her years of living with an aging Miller, but dozens of Miller’s own personal tales about his life and times. In May, 2011, Eio Books produced its first book of fantasy and psychological horror: Houdini Heart. It was considered for the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel. Early in 2012, Eio reprinted Ki Longfellow's first published novel, China Blues (published under the name Pamela Longfellow): (Harper Collins (UK), Doubleday (US), as well as eight foreign language printings. In 1989 China Blues was the subject of a bidding war between a number of major publishers. Recently, the small publishing house added a new name to its roster of writers: James C. McKay, a highly placed litigator who served as the special prosecutor investigating the part of Edwin Meese III in the Wedtech scandal. At the time, Meese was Attorney General under the Reagan Administration. McKay's two books, one a memoir and one a thriller set in and around the Food and Drug Administration are being prepared for publication. The semi-autobiographical Billy's War was published in April 2013. Also in early April 2013, Longfellow's first three titles in a series of murder mysteries in the hardboiled noir tradition featuring Sam Russo, 1940s Staten Island, New York Private Eye, saw print."

  "text" : "The East End Dwellings Company was a Victorian philanthropic model dwellings company, operating in the East End of London in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The company was founded in principle in 1882 by, among others, Samuel Augustus Barnett, vicar of St Jude's Church, Whitechapel; it was finally incorporated in 1884. Its aim was to \"house the very poor while realizing some profit\", \"their particular purpose being to erect blocks of dwellings, to be let by the room, so that the poorest class of labourers could be accommodated\". Unlike many of the model dwellings companies, the EEDC offered accommodation to the casual poor and day labourers. The company's first venture was Katharine Buildings in Aldgate, followed by a number of schemes in Bethnal Green, London. They went on to build around the East End. Along the principles of Octavia Hill's schemes, the company used female rent-collectors, including Beatrice Potter (later Webb), one of the founders of the London School of Economics & Political Science and Ella Pycroft, who ran the Buildings alongside Maurice Eden Paul."

  "text" : "The Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust is a registered charity set up with its main aim to help children and young adults aged between 8-24 to regain their confidence through sailing. It was founded in 2003 after Ellen MacArthur went sailing with another charity in France with the same aim. It runs a number of various types of trips ranging from residentials to one-day trips. Every year in the summer, the trust takes around 300 young people sailing. The trust also now works with every young person's cancer treatment centre in the United Kingdom. The trust's head office is in East Cowes. The trust receives no government funding, and relies entirely on public and corporate support to operate. There is no charge made to any of the young people who sail with the trust. Often the young people that sail with the trust have spent long periods of time in hospital and can be suffering from low self-esteem on top of missing out on large chunks of their childhood. The emphasis of the trips is on teamwork and fun, with sailing as the perfect catalyst. Sailing offers a new experience in a small and intimate environment, which gives the young people the space to assert themselves without the chance of getting lost in the group. There are many issues for all young people that revolve around body image, but these are magnified for those who have been through treatment, particularly when reaching teenage years. The treatments for cancer can include side effects such as temporary hair loss and weight gain as well as permanent effects like scarring, amputation or brain damage, and the result can often manifest itself in very low self-esteem or confidence. When the young people come on the trips they aren't alone in having no hair, or a scar on their leg, and it becomes much less of an issue. Everyone on their trip will have been through a similar experience and generally understand better than any of their friends from home what it is like to go though such a life-changing experience as cancer, often offering advice and support. These trips can be a huge step forward in regaining the independence often lost during long periods of hospitalisation. This can be especially significant if the young person was diagnosed having just reached puberty, the time when they were beginning to assert themselves to the world. At that point, to subsequently find yourself having to rely on parents or nurses for everything you need can be incredibly hard to accept, and this is on top of dealing with a life-threatening illness. The highlight of many people's trips is cooking for themselves, and these small steps, along with the larger ones like being in control of a 42-foot (13 m) yacht, help move the young person forward from the feeling of 'institutionalisation' the hospital can sometimes leave on them, helping to establish the attitude that they can actually achieve a lot, and more importantly achieve it by themselves. After sailing once with the trust the young people are invited back at least once, and often several times to different water-based activities, to strengthen friendships, offer support and learn more about sailing as their recovery continues. Many young people will eventually return as volunteers, becoming aspirational role models for those sailing for the first time who have rarely met anyone now several years off treatment and doing well."

  "text" : "Endurance International Group, Inc. (EIG), formerly BizLand, is a web hosting company. The company was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts. It achieved its size by acquiring a large number of smaller companies, which it continues to operate under the original brand names. In 2011, Endurance was bought from Accel-KKR by Warburg Pincus and GS Capital Partners, for around $975 million. In September 2013, the company announced plans to raise $400 million in an IPO. The company announced it would list on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol EIGI. It went public in October 2013 raising $252 million selling shares to the public at $12 each. This was below the company's target goal of $400 million. In a 2015 investor earnings conference call, the company reported having 4.2 million worldwide users. This path to increased size is similar to the path networking company Verio followed in the 1990s, using free cash flow and access to capital markets  in acquiring assets to add to their corporate portfolio. The concept was to roll up small ISPs into one large national ISP and achieve economies of scale. Endurance, though U.S. based, is acquiring hosting companies domestically and internationally. Blake Cunneen, Endurance's senior vice president of corporate development has stated: \"Investing in mergers and acquisitions is a very accretive use of free cash flow and going forward we'll continue to do so. We don't have any deals we're announcing. But we told the Street to expect M&A growth to continue.\" The company made four buys in 2014. The biggest being a $109.8 million cash and stock deal for the web presence business of Directi from Indian-based Directi Web Technologies. Directi provides services in various countries, including India, the U.S., Turkey, China, Russia and Indonesia. In April 2014, a major network issue at the data center in Provo, Utah, affected customers of Bluehost, HostMonster and JustHost, and took down many of the dedicated servers owned by HostGator customers. In March 2015, the company announced an investment in Netherlands-based technology startup AppMachine, acquiring 40% of the company. In August 2015, EIG announced the acquisition of Site5 and Verio Web Hosting from NTT. It is estimated that EIG gained 86,000+ new subscribers through these acquisitions. In November 2015, the company acquired Constant Contact, and days later laid off 15% of their workforce. Also in November 2015, EIG acquired the assets of Ecommerce, LLC for $28 million. This acquisition included a total of 72,000 subscribers from three different hosting brands: IX Web Hosting, Cloud by IX, and Host Excellence."

  "text" : "The Ernst Barre Private Brewery (German: Privatbrauerei Ernst Barre GmbH) is a brewery in the East Westphalian town of Lübbecke in the north-western German district of Minden-Lübbecke. It was founded by Ernst Johann Barre in 1842. Along with its immediate competitor, the Herforder Brauerei, it is one of the largest breweries in East Westphalia (based on beer production), and is thus of regional importance. The brewery is located at the southern end of the pass over the Wiehen Hills (Bundesstrasse 239) between Lübbecke and Hüllhorst, at the base of the Reineberg hill, and has been in the same family for generations. The brewery not only supports numerous festivals in the region, but it has even founded a festival of its own, the Bierbrunnenfest (Beer Fountain Festival), which has been celebrated in Lübbecke since 1954. Incredibly, this involves serving thousands of litres of beer to the general populace - at no charge whatsoever. Barre Bräu is not just popular in the Lübbecker Land, but also further north on the North German Plain, and in the district of Herford, to the south of Lübbecke. Barre Bräu is brewed in accordance with the purity law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516, and the brewery is a founding member of the Die Freien Brauer (Independent Brewers) initiative, an association of medium-sized private breweries in Germany and Austria. According to its own sources, Barre Bräu produced 150 000 hectolitres of beer during 2010, which is just over 2% of the annual output of Germany's largest brewery. However, Barre Bräu has a reputation for quality and operates very successfully in its niche market."

  "text" : "EMU Australia (simply referred to as EMU; pronounced eem-you, often mispronounced eem-moo) is an Australian lifestyle brand that designs, produces and markets footwear and accessories. The brand is best known for their sheepskin and Merino Wool products. Their signature products are sheepskin boots, which have been a popular fashion trend for young women since the 2000s. EMU products are also available for men and children. Originally established in 1948 as Jackson's Tannery by Gordon Jackson, Jackson's supplied ugg boots to several retailers including a Western Australian company, Country Leather, who supplied their products to Ugg Holdings in the United States. In 1994, Country Leather opened its own shop in Redondo Beach, California and Ugg Holdings began sourcing ugg boots directly from Jackson's, who had changed their name to EMU Australia when surf veteran Andrew Raggett took over ownership of the company. Following the sale of Ugg Holdings to Deckers Outdoor Corporation, who outsourced the manufacture of ugg boots to China in 1995, EMU continued production and sales under their own Emu brand. The main headquarters for the company is located in South Geelong, Victoria, Australia. International locations include Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States; Hamburg, Germany; and London, England. EMU Australia's main competitor for ugg boots in the Australian market is Luda Productions, which holds approximately 75% market share in Australia. The main competing brands in EMU's overseas markets are UGG Australia, manufactured by Deckers Outdoor Corporation, and Bearpaw, which produce similar sheepskin products and who hold over 95% market share worldwide between them. The name \"EMU\" is derived from the Australian Coat of Arms which features the emu bird."

ETCO's products can be found in electronic home appliances sold by several major appliance manufacturers. The products can also be found in cars sold by automotive manufacturers as well as medical and telecommunications companies. ETCO remains a family-owned business, as descendants of the founder (from the Dunn Family) own over 85% of the company. As a result, most of its growth has been due to reinvestment of the company's own earnings rather than public financing."

EDGE preschools and affiliated organizations span across 9 countries in 4 continents. The EDGE accreditation process involves adoption of a green curriculum within the basic teachings of early preschool education. Founded in 2007 by three very diverse women in business, both EDGE and EDGE Charitable Foundation have positively impacted growth, environmental awareness, and early childhood education among thousands of children in the United States, India, Central America, Africa, and the Caribbean. Its unique integration of the three R's (reduse, reuse, and recycle) into basic preschool education have placed EDGE accredited schools on the national map and globally. As a result it has earned the tagline; \"Educators. Environmentalists. Humanitarians.\" The organization launched its flagship school Old Cutler Academy in 2007 which earned the distinct recognition of \"the first eco-friendly preschool in the state of Florida and the United States,\" with congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen awarding the school a Congressional Proclamation. In addition to its network of accredited eco-friendly schools, EDGE is a family of dedicated business professionals, and educators. Its global mission is to teach environmental education and social responsibility."

  "text" : "Elecraft, Inc. is an American manufacturer of amateur radio equipment and kits, based in Aptos, California. It was founded in 1998 by Wayne Burdick and Eric Swartz. The company's first product was the K2 transceiver which was first prototyped in October 1997. The company is most notable for the Elecraft K3 high-performance HF transceiver, a 32-bit DSP based radio covering HF plus the 6-meter VHF band and the 160m MF band, introduced in 2008. The reception of the K3 was overwhelmingly positive, with a comprehensive review in QST stating that \"The K3, in any of the available configurations, provides a high performance, modular and expandable transceiver that can fill the needs of almost anyone looking for an HF and 6 meter transceiver for home station or portable use\". At the time of its introduction, the K3 received the highest Sherwood Engineering ranking of any amateur radio receiver. Elecraft's product lineup includes a range of QRP CW transceivers, the K2 and K3 all-mode 100W transceiver, KX3 portable 160m-2m transceiver, linear power amplifiers, two panadapters and a range of accessories including antenna tuners and signal generators. Many Elecraft products are available both as kits and as ready-built units. All offer expansion options. One K3 option, the K144XV, adds a 10-watt 2m internal transceiver. The KX3 can accommodate a single internal VHF transverter module. The KX3-2M adds the 2M band and the KX3-4M adds 4M band, both with ]2.5-watt output. The 2m module receives 120-165 MHz, and transmits on the 2m ham band. The 4m module covers 65-72 MHz. Sensitivity gradually falls off outside the ham bands, though the 2m module is capable of receiving 162 MHz weather-band stations and 120 MHz airport tower AM. The KX3 transceiver is a portable software-defined radio (SDR) transceiver with a full-featured knob-and-button interface. Although it is an SDR transceiver, it does not require a computer connection. The company's well regarded \"K-Line\" consists of the K3 transceiver, the KPA500 500W power amplifier, the KAT500 automatic antenna tuner, and the P3 panadapter. Also the P3SVGA add-on to the P3 to display the panadapter data on a large screen and the W2 HF/VHF/UHF wattmeter are sometimes considered part of the K-Line. Most recently Elecrafthas introduced the \"KX-Line\" consisting of the KX3 transceiver, the PX3 panadapter, and the KXPA100 100W power amplifier. In 2015, Elecraft introduced the K3S Transceiver as a direct replacement for the K3 Transceiver. The K3S is a redesign of the K3 and includes the following new or upgraded features:(1) Ultra-low-noise synthesizer,(2) Second preamp (Preamp 2),(3) Multiple attenuation levels,(4) Dual computer ports (USB and RS232),(5) KAT3A option now includes bypass relay,(6) Redesigned speaker amplifier,(7) Fast transmit/receive switching,(8) Extended coverage includes 630 and 2200 meter bands, and(9) Enhanced look and feel.Most of these improvements can be back fitted to an older K3."

  "text" : "Eurovegas was a gambling resort project proposed in September 2012, to be completed in 2025 or 2026 in Alcorcón, Spain. The project was cancelled after disagreements between the entrepreneur, Sheldon Adelson, and the local governments. In September 2012 Sheldon Adelson proposed a major investment in Europe after he and his team had been in discussions with government officials in Madrid and Barcelona and possibly elsewhere in Europe. Finally, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed \"EuroVegas\". More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the \"EuroVegas\" project. It is expected to take about ten years to build Eventually in 2025 or 2026 Eurovegas would have occupied approximately 2000 acres (7.5 square kilometers), and when completed, would have comprised: \n* twelve skyscraper hotels up to 500 feet (150m) high capable of accommodating several thousands of guests in considerable luxury. \n*  six casinos \n*  three golf courses and other sports facilities, notably an indoor stadium and covered tennis complex,  \n*  a shopping mall and outlet stores  \n*  a major convention center and assorted meeting facilities \n*  a wide range of restaurants,  \n*  assorted Leisure centres including a spa and adventure park \n*  an amphitheater for 20,000 people and various concert facilities \n*  parks including nature reserve The developer planned to the first phase in 2016 but reports that the Government of Spain was reluctant to grant the various legal exemptions necessary. In effect, the company wanted a legal tax haven in which the Europe wide ban on smoking in public places would not apply, its management code would replace national employment regulations. These issues relate to easements of various European Directives, and may be a smokescreen to obscure funding difficulties Eurovegas would have been the third resort macrocomplex to open outside of the United States of America (after Macau and Singapore). The completion of the works was planned to wait until 2022 and inauguration final and official until 2025 or 2026."

  "text" : "Edition·S – music¬sound¬art (formerly known as Edition SAMFUNDET and ”Samfundet til Udgivelse af Dansk Musik” – ”The Society for the Publication of Danish Music”) is one of Denmark's oldest publishing houses. It was founded as an association in 1871 by a small circle of composers and musicians around the composer Peter Heise with the purpose of promoting and preserving Danish music. In 1887, after a big decrease in the number of members of the association, the Society decided to publish primarily new music, and this has been the focus ever since. Carl Nielsen, one of Denmark's greatest composers, was a member of the Board from 1899 to his death in 1931 and had a number of works published through the Society before as well as after his death. In 2011 the publishing house changed its name to Edition S – music¬sound¬art, which was pronounceable for non-Danes as well. This was to accommodate the international scene for new art music that showed an increasing interest in Danish composers. Edition S has since 1890 been supported financially by the state. The company was restructured and became a private trust in 2007, but the state support is still the main source enabling Edition S to carry on its activity."

In 2006, they became first in the industry to become part Peak Choice, an ethical farmers co-operative formed after a visit by the Prince of Wales. The company is run by a husband and wife, Karen and Tim, who decided in 2006 to stop supplying mass-produced chicken and eggs, and only supply free range, \"ethically sourced\" products. Their meat was initially supplied by an organisation called Peak Choice, whose members are part of both the Farm Assurance Scheme and the Environmental Stewardship Scheme. There is very little transport of livestock, and the farmers work to enhance and preserve the natural environment of the Peak District National Park, from where most of the food is sourced. The company were also informed that Prince Charles would be \"watching the venture closely\", as, at the time, only Earlsdon Butchers were supplying meat from the co-operative. In 2010, the business doubled in size after an £8,000 refit, adding a kitchen and a delicatessen counter. The refit took three months of planning and two months of works to complete. The refit was supported by Heart of England Fine Foods, who awarded them with a free deli counter through HEFF's 'Savour the Flavour' Scheme. Closed down 26 April 2014"

However, it was created among other things; to hold the Manila International Film Festival, to manage the Manila Film Center, administer a film rating and classification system and to establish and operate the National Film Archive. It was also mandated to provide financial assistance to select motion pictures through a film fund. For purposes of policy coordination, it was placed under the Ministry of Tourism. While its initial films were critically acclaimed, the ECP was accused of producing sex-oriented or \"Bomba\" films later in its history until it was dissolved in 1986."

The EDO's lawyers provide access to justice for the Queensland community by offering legal advice and education and engaging in policy and law reform. The work done by community legal centres specialising in public interest environmental law such as EDO Qld has been acknowledged. In a 2012 report into access to justice, the Commonwealth Productivity Commission concluded that \"there are strong grounds for the legal assistance sector to receive funding to undertake strategic advocacy, law reform and public interest litigation including in relation to environmental matters\" given the important contribution the EDOs make to not only strengthening community rights but also the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia's environmental protection laws.  This sentiment has been echoed members of the legal profession, including most notably the Honourable Judge Brian Preston, Chief Judge of the Planning and Environment Court of New South Wales,  as well as Adrian Finanzio SC."

  "text" : "Endocyte (NASDAQ: ECYT) is a biopharmaceutical company established in 1996 and headquartered in West Lafayette, Indiana, a resident of the Purdue Research Park. In 2011 the company completed successfully an initial public offering (IPO). As of 2013, the company had 93 employees. The original president and CEO, Ron Ellis, was succeeded by Mike Sherman, who held a CFO position at the company before this change in June 2016. Endocyte is advancing the first technology platform for the creation of small molecule drug conjugates (a.k.a. SMDCs), which consist of a small molecule linked to a potent drug, and is developing a pipeline of SMDCs together with non-invasive companion imaging agents for cancer, inflammatory diseases and kidney disease (autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease/ADPKDor PKD). Endocyte’s lead drug candidate is vintafolide, an investigational targeted cancer therapeutic in late-stage development. In 2012 marketing rights were acquired by Merck for $120 million in an upfront payment and up to $880 million in milestone payments.Vintafolide is a small molecule drug conjugate consisting of a small molecule targeting the folate receptor, which is expressed on many cancers, such as ovarian cancer, and a potent chemotherapy drug, a derivative of vinblastine. Endocyte retained rights to the development and commercialization of etarfolatide. Endocyte’s other preclinical drug candidates also target the folate receptor as well as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptors. The company was formed based on technology developed by Philip Low (the company's CSO), and Christopher Leamon, PhD, the company’s VP of research. This technology is a folic acid-based drug delivery system, referred to now as folate targeting. The company is also developing SMDCs with varying drug payloads as well as different ligands for other molecular targets, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and has also developed, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, an epothilone-folic acid conjugate (BMS-753493), described at a 2008 conference."

  "text" : "Electromagnetic Geoservices ASA (EMGS) is a Norwegian geophysical services company using proprietary marine electromagnetic technology to support oil and gas companies in their search for offshore hydrocarbons. The administrative and research headquarters are located in Trondheim. The company was established on February 1, 2002 by the founders Terje Eidesmo, Ståle Johansen and Svein Ellingsrud. EMGS pioneered marine electromagnetic technology with the first successful application and commercialization of controlled source electro-magnetic surveying technology (CSEM). Marine EM, or CSEM, is an emerging exploration method that uses electromagnetic energy to detect resistive bodies - including hydrocarbon reservoirs - beneath the seabed. The technique used by EMGS was trialled in 1998 using a towed, high-power EM source and a series of seabed receivers, while the founders were working for Statoil. The company acquires 3D electromagnetic and marine magnetotelluric data, which are used to assess formation resistivity before drilling, and interpret and integrate this information with other geodata to aid exploration decision making. 3D EM data is routinely used for lead generation, prospect ranking and volume assessments. Main offices and research department are located in Trondheim, Norway. The company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on March 30, 2007. EMGS also hold offices in Oslo, Norway together with Houston, US and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. In 2007, two of the founders of EMGS, Terje Eidesmo and Svein Ellingsrud, were awarded the Virgil Kauffman Gold Medal from the Society of Exploration Geophysicists in recognition of their pioneering work in applying controlled-source electromagnetics to the detection of hydrocarbons."

In 2002 the subsidiary changed its named to simply Ericsson AB and absorbed 19 other legal entities in the Ericsson sphere, but kept its company registration number with the Swedish state, so it is still the same legal entity as Ericsson Radio Systems. The merge of the smaller legal entities was done to cut down operating costs. The main activity within Ericsson AB is infrastructure for mobile telephony."

  "text" : "The Edison and Swan Electric Light Company Limited was an English manufacturer of incandescent lamp bulbs and other electrical goods. It was formed in 1883 with the name Edison & Swan United Electric Light Company with the merger of the Swan United Electric Company and the Edison Electric Light Company. Joseph Swan had established the Swan United Electric Light Company in the early 1880s to market the incandescent lamp bulb he had invented. In 1882 the British Edison Company of Thomas Edison sued Swan, claiming infringement of Edison's U.S. patent of 1879; however, the lawyers became aware that Swan would be able demonstrate prior research and publication, and instead negotiated a merger with Swan's company. The lamp bulbs manufactured by the company were almost entirely to Swan's design. From 1887 or earlier Sir Ambrose Fleming was an adviser to the company, and conducted research at Ponders End. The company had offices at 155 Charing Cross Road, London, and factories in Brimsdown, Ponders End and Sunderland. In 1928, the company was acquired by Associated Electrical Industries. In 1956, a new cathode ray tube plant was opened in Sunderland. The company was renamed Siemens Ediswan following the takeover of Siemens Brothers by AEI in 1957. In 1964, AEI merged its lamp and radio valve manufacturing interests with those of Thorn Electrical Industries to form British Lighting Industries Ltd."

EZLynx’s core product, the EZLynx Rating Engine, was the first comparative rater with real-time quoting for auto and home insurance available to independent agents. The National Association of Professional Insurance Agent’s (PIA) annual publication stated that this innovation provided independent insurance agents the ability to compete with online direct writers, which revolutionized the industry. The Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (IIABA) chose EZLynx to partner with its Project CAP, because it gave companies and local independent agents the ability to get accurate real-time auto and home quotes from multiple insurance companies."

Whilst not technically a co-operative itself, the organisation has helped create at least ten wind co-ops, including Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative and Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative, who, along with Baywind, own Energy4All. One of the co-operatives it has created, Energy Prospects Co-operative, specialises in taking early stage wind co-operatives through the development and planning application stages to the point where a community share offer, managed by Energy4All, can be launched to fund the project. They won an Ashden Award in 2012."

The company offers nine different types of food, none of which include grains. Pet food that contains a high proportion of meant, fruit, and vegetables and low carbohydrate content is widely believed to be better for pet health. Essential Foods are sold through online boutiques, retail distributors including Fressnapf in Denmark, Fifty Sheep in the UK, Amazon.co.uk, and several independent retailers in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Poland, Norway, Sweden & Denmark. Essential Foods were developed with the aim of optimizing good behavior in companion animals, especially dogs, by ensuring stability of the animal's blood sugar levels. The high proportion of meat and low cooking temperature used in preparing the food are meant to stabilize blood sugar. The company was established and is currently administrated by a Danish business man  who previously founded and was the CEO of Oliver's Petfood. A portion of the profits from Essential Foods is donated to charity."
