  "text" : "Jeep is a brand of American automobiles that is a division of FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group, LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The former Chrysler Corporation acquired the Jeep brand, along with the remaining assets of its owner American Motors, in 1987. The division is headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off-road vehicles, but has also included pickup trucks in the past. The original Jeep was the prototype Bantam BRC. Willys MB Jeeps went into production in 1941 specifically for the military, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs. The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II, as well as the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart notes: The spartan, cramped, and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky, can-do determination. The first civilian models were produced in 1945. It inspired a number of other light utility vehicles, such as the Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations."

  "text" : "Jaguar (/ˈdʒæɡjuː.ər/ JAG-ew-ər) is the luxury vehicle brand of Jaguar Land Rover, a British multinational car manufacturer with its headquarters in Whitley, Coventry, England, owned by the Indian company Tata Motors since 2008. Jaguar's business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under the ownership of S. S. Cars Limited the business extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Co many bearing Jaguar as a model name. The company's name was changed from S. S. Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975. Jaguar was de-merged from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, becoming a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was acquired by Ford in 1990. Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the British Prime Minister, the most recent delivery being an XJ in May 2010. The company also holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. Jaguar cars today are designed in Jaguar Land Rover's engineering centres at the Whitley plant in Coventry and at their Gaydon site in Warwickshire, and are assembled in their plants at Castle Bromwich and Solihull. In September 2013 Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to open a 100 million GBP (160 million USD) research and development centre in the University of Warwick, Coventry to create a new generation of vehicle technologies. The carmaker said around 1,000 academics and engineers would work there and that construction would start in 2014."

The majority of John Smith's sales are of the nitrogenated Extra Smooth product, although a cask conditioned variant is available nationally. A stronger variant called Magnet is also available in the North East of England. John Smith's Cask and Magnet are produced under licence by Cameron's in Hartlepool. John Smith acquired the Backhouse & Hartley brewery in 1852. Following a series of acquisitions in the post-World War II period, the company became one of the largest regional brewers in the country, operating over 1,800 licensed premises. The company was taken over by Courage in 1970 who extended distribution of the brewery's products into the South of England. Courage was acquired by Scottish & Newcastle in 1995, and the operations were purchased by Heineken in 2008. John Smith's Extra Smooth and Original are produced at the Tadcaster brewery, as well as a range of Heineken products including Kronenbourg 1664 and Newcastle Brown Ale. With a 3.8 million hectolitre capacity, the brewery is one of the largest in the country. John Smith's became well known for a series of highly successful \"No Nonsense\"-themed television advertising campaigns, featuring the dour Yorkshireman character \"Arkwright\" during the 1970s and 1980s (shown only in the South of England), followed by the comedians Jack Dee during the 1990s and Peter Kay since 2002. In addition, it is a major sponsor of horse racing in the UK: it was the principal sponsor of the Grand National between 2005 and 2013 and continues to sponsor the Northumberland Plate as well as other events."

  "text" : "Japan Post (日本郵政公社 Nippon Yūsei Kōsha) was a government-owned corporation in Japan that existed from 2003 to 2007, offering postal and package delivery services, banking services, and life insurance. It was the nation's largest employer, with over 400,000 employees, and ran 24,700 post offices throughout Japan. One third of all Japanese government employees worked for Japan Post. As of 2005, the President of the company was Masaharu Ikuta, formerly Chairman of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. Japan Post ran the world's largest postal savings system and was often said to be the largest holder of personal savings in the world: with ¥224 trillion ($2.1 trillion) of household assets in its yū-cho savings accounts and ¥126 trillion ($1.2 trillion) of household assets in its kampo life insurance services, its holdings accounted for 25 percent of household assets in Japan. Japan Post also held about ¥140 trillion (one fifth) of the Japanese national debt in the form of government bonds. On October 1, 2007 Japan Post was privatized following a fierce political debate that was settled by the general election of 2005. Following privatization, the Japan Post Group companies operate the postal business. In 2010, privatization was put on hold. The Japanese Ministry of Finance remains the 100% shareholder. However, on October 26, 2012, the Japanese government unveiled plans to list shares of the Japan Post Holdings Company within three years, partly to raise money for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami of 2011."

  "text" : "Japan Freight Railway Company (日本貨物鉄道株式会社 Nihon Kamotsu Tetsudō Kabushiki-gaisha), or JR Freight (JR貨物 Jeiāru Kamotsu), is one of the constituent companies of Japan Railways Group (JR Group). It provides transportation of cargo nationwide. Its headquarters are in Shibuya, Tokyo near Shinjuku Station. The Japan Railways Group was founded on April 1, 1987, when Japanese National Railways (JNR) was privatized, and then divided into six regional companies and Japan Freight Railway Company. Although the passenger operation of JNR was split into six companies, fares and regulations are standard for all companies and every region of Japan except Okinawa is covered by the railway network spanning approximately 19,800 kilometres (12,300 mi). Formerly part of JNR, the freight operation was not divided and became a single separate company when JNR was privatized and split. Although it has only about fifty kilometers of track of its own, it also operates on track owned by the JR passenger railways and other companies. The company uses the initials JRF as an abbreviated name for identification."

It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown-Forman Corporation since 1956. Despite being the location of a major operational distillery, Jack Daniel's home county of Moore is a dry county, so the product is not available for purchase at stores or restaurants within the county. The product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight bourbon, though the company disavows this classification and markets it simply as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon. As defined in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Tennessee Whiskey is classified as a straight bourbon authorized to be produced in the state of Tennessee. Packaged in distinctive square bottles, a total of 11 million cases of the flagship \"Black Label\" product were sold in the company's fiscal year ended April 30, 2013."

  "text" : "The John Lewis Partnership (JLP) is an employee-owned UK company which operates John Lewis department stores, Waitrose supermarkets, its banking and financial services, and other retail-related activities. The company is owned by a trust on behalf of all its employees — known as Partners – who have a say in the running of the business, and receive a share of annual profits, which is usually a significant addition to their salary. The JLP group is the third largest UK private company by sales in the Sunday Times Top Track 100 for 2016. John Lewis also has the distinction of being the UK's best high-street website after beating Marks & Spencer in October 2010. The chain's image is upmarket, and it appeals strongly to middle- and upper-class shoppers. Recently, however, John Lewis has broadened its marketing strategy towards all types of buyers, with the introduction of the 'Value' range to John Lewis and the 'Essential' range to Waitrose, and the expansion of the business. The Partnership also supplies the Ocado web supermarket with Waitrose own-brand foods and John Lewis own-brand non-food items."

Most JCPenney stores are located in suburban shopping malls. Before 1966, most of its stores were located in downtown areas. As shopping malls became more popular during the latter half of the 20th century, JCPenney followed the trend by relocating and developing stores to anchor the malls. In more recent years, the chain has continued to follow consumer traffic, echoing the retailing trend of opening some freestanding stores, including some next door to competitors. Certain stores are located in power centers. The company has been an Internet retailer since 1998. It has streamlined its catalog and distribution while undergoing renovation improvements at store level."

As an independent company, it was last headquartered in the JAS M1 Building at Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) in Ōta, Tokyo. It has since merged with Japan Airlines. JAS was famous for its variety of aircraft liveries; Amy Chavez of The Japan Times described the rainbow liveries as \"abstract.\" Many of its color schemes in the 1990s were designed by film director Akira Kurosawa. The airline's slogan was \"Good Speed Always\"."

  "text" : "Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology. Juniper was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. The company received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37 percent share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share. It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014. Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, Juniper entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003, before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products."

Types include microlights (Ultralight or ULM), including the Calypso, two-seat trainers (J/120/J160/ J170/j230) and four-seat aircraft (J400/ J430/J450). The aircraft are built largely of composite materials and are conventional high-wing monoplanes with typically tricycle undercarriage, although taildragger versions are also available. The wings can be removed for ease of storage or transportation. Use of modern composite techniques has resulted in a strong yet light structure. The aircraft are designed around the pilot and passengers, being spacious and comfortable for touring, yet with a small footprint and frontal profile. Controls include a centrally mounted control column, brake and trim lever. There is also a Jabiru assembly facility in George, Western Cape, South Africa."

  "text" : "Johnny Rockets is an American restaurant franchise whose themed decor is based upon 1950s diner-style restaurants. Decor includes Coca-Cola advertising featuring nearly life-size cardboard illustrations of women in World War II armed services uniforms, individual jukebox stations, chrome accents and red vinyl seats. The staff at some locations are known to sing and dance every half-hour. Making a smiley face with ketchup on the paper plate when serving French fries is a Johnny Rockets trademark. The menu, presentation, counter seating and grilling area are based on an original restaurant from 1947 (still operating today), The Apple Pan in West Los Angeles. The restaurants feature a small two-sided menu. Hamburgers are grilled-to-order in full view of the customers and are served wrapped in paper on paper plates."

Jordan cars were noted more for attractive styling than for advanced engineering, although they did bring their share of innovations to the marketplace. Not surprisingly, the company's advertising was often more original than the cars themselves. Said Jordan, “Cars are too dull and drab.” He reasoned that since people dressed smartly, they were willing to drive “smart looking cars” as well."

  "text" : "J.D. Irving Limited (JDI) traces its roots to a sawmill operated in Bouctouche, New Brunswick by its namesake, James Dargavel Irving. J.D. Irving's operations were entrusted to his children, one of which, Kenneth Colin Irving, assumed majority ownership and used JDI as a springboard for expanding into pulp and paper and other forestry-related businesses between the 1920s-1940s. In the post-war years, JDI took control of pulp mills in Saint John and upstate New York, as well as sawmills throughout New Brunswick. During the 1950s, JDI took control of a shipyard in Saint John and started several trucking companies and heavy industry companies like Irving Equipment to satisfy the growing needs of the company. From the 1960s-2000s, JDI expanded to become the largest forestry concern in the Maritimes and northern Maine and the region's largest industrial player, with extensive land holdings, tree nurseries, pulp mills (plants producing kraft pulp, supercalendered paper, tissue products, and corrugated medium), sawmills, a retail chain of home improvement stores (Kent Building Supplies), modular home construction (Kent Homes), industrial construction, wallboard manufacturing, marine towing and dredging (Atlantic Towing), prefabricated concrete (StresCon), steel fabrication (Ocean Steel), frozen food production (Cavendish Farms), fertilizer and agri-services (Cavendish Agri-Services), railways (New Brunswick Southern Railway), and manufacturing of personal care products including tissue and paper towels (Majesta and Royale) as well as diapers (Irving Personal Care). In the 1970s and 1980s, JDI expanded into trucking with its Scot Truck subsidiary based in Debert, NS. Now called Midland Transport and based in Dieppe, NB, it is joined by sister companies Midland Courier (Dieppe), Sunbury Transport (Fredericton) and RST Industries (Saint John). JDI is also the largest shipbuilder in Canada with ownership of shipyards in Halifax, Liverpool, Shelburne, and Georgetown."

  "text" : "The Joseph Huber Brewing Company was founded in 1845 in Monroe, Wisconsin. Originally called The Blumer Brewery, it adopted the Huber name in 1947. It is the oldest continually operating brewery in the Midwest and second oldest in the United States. Huber reached its most successful point around 1978, when its Augsburger brand received awards from several prominent beer reviewers and became a top seller for the company. The brewery was sold in 1985 for $7.8 million; in 1988 the new owners sold the Augsburger label to Stroh Brewery Company and later briefly closed the brewery. Fred Huber, son of Joseph, bought the brewery and resumed operations in a partnership with Chicago's Berghoff family, but the brewery filed for bankruptcy and was sold in 1995. In 2006, Mountain Crest Brewing Company of Calgary, Alberta, Canada purchased the Joseph Huber Brewing Company, the Huber and Rhinelander brands of beer, and the Blumers brand of soda. The Monroe brewery was renamed Minhas Craft Brewery. In 2010 a beer museum was opened at the brewery. The brewery suffered serious damage in a November 2013 fire, but was returning to operation by January 2014. The Berghoff Brewing Company contracted with Mountain Crest until 2013 to brew Berghoff beer at the Monroe plant and continues to produce Berghoff's root beer, which is sold in traditional glass bottles in the Midwestern United States. The Berghoff brand was named after the Berghoff Cafe and Tavern in Chicago. The Minhas Brewery has tours for adults and children in which visitors may receive a free 6-pack of 5 different beers and a soda. Blumers soda uses 100% cane sugar."

The company was founded by John George Brill in 1868 as a horsecar manufacturing firm in Philadelphia. Over the years, it absorbed numerous other trolley-interurban manufacturers such as Kuhlman in Cleveland and Jewett in Indiana. With business diminishing, in 1944 it merged with the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) to become ACF-Brill. It ceased trolley and bus production in 1954, though some of their interurbans served the Philadelphia area till the 1980s. Brill was the longest lasting of the nation's trolley and interurban manufacturers. It manufactured over 45,000 streetcars, trams (also known as trolleys or trolley cars in the U.S.), motor buses, trolleybuses and railroad cars. At its height, it was the largest manufacturer of streetcars and interurbans in the U.S. and produced more streetcars and interurbans and gas electrics than any other manufacturer."

  "text" : "J. W. Spear and Sons was a significant manufacturer of board games during the 20th century. The company was founded by Jacob Wolf Spier (1832-1893) in Fürth, near Nuremberg, Germany in 1879, producing goods such as table mats, photo frames, and waste-paper baskets. By the turn of the century, games had become the main product, and output gradually expanded until the company become one of the best-known international manufacturers of games and children's activity kits, employing up to 600 people. In 1932, they set up a factory in Brimsdown, Enfield, Britain to avoid customs duties. With the rise to power of the Nazis and the Spear family being Jewish, some members of the family moved to Britain. The Nuremberg factory was forcibly \"purchased\" by a German businessman, and survived most of World War II under Nazi control until the Royal Air Force bombed it. The UK factory switched to military production during the war and then returned to making games. In 1954 the company acquired the rights to produce and market Scrabble for markets outside North America. As well as board games they made the Brickplayer construction toy. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1966 and was taken over by Mattel in 1994 after a bidding war with Hasbro. Mattel closed the UK factory and while it still produces Scrabble, most of the traditional Spear's Games are no longer made."

Originally an independent company, Jumbo Video is now essentially the English Canadian brand of SuperClub, Quebec's dominant video rental chain, and the two brands now share similar marketing. As a result of the 2011-12 closures of Blockbuster Canada and Rogers Video, SuperClub and Jumbo together form Canada's largest remaining video rental chain. The company was founded in May 1987 and at one point claimed to be the third-largest player in the Canadian video rental industry. The video game subsidiary Microplay was founded in the late 1990s in order to facilitate the rentals of video games. In 2004, due to financial issues that had been prevalent for many years, the assets of the chain were purchased by Quebecor Media. This resulted in the re-branding of the stores with the current logo. As of early 2015, the Jumbo Video website lists 11 locations, five located in Ontario and the other six in various communities in Atlantic Canada. The chain was previously publicly traded as a company called Jumbo Entertainment Inc. After selling its assets to Quebecor, the remaining shell company agreed to a reverse takeover by clothing retailer West 49."

Airlines and private pilots, airline operations centers, military teams, ship operators and boaters, as well as railway companies use Jeppesen charts, data, and operations management tools. The company is a subsidiary of Boeing. Jeppesen also publishes related software, some of which is used on its electronic flight bag and in others offered by avionics manufacturers and other third parties. Jeppesen is headquartered in Inverness, Colorado, a census designated place in Arapahoe County. The postal designation of Englewood is used in the company’s mailing address. Jeppesen has offices in locations around the world, including Neu-Isenburg (Germany), Massa (Italy), Crawley (United Kingdom), Gothenburg (Sweden), Canberra (Australia) and Gdańsk (Poland). The company employs approximately 3,200 people. In the navigation space, which is where Jeppesen started, Jeppesen's charts are often called \"Jepp charts\" or simply \"Jepps\" by pilots, due to the charts' de facto popularity. This popularity extends to electronic charts, which are increasingly favored over paper charts by pilots and mariners as mobile computing devices, electronic flight bags, integrated electronic bridge systems and other display devices become more common and readily available."

The bank is relatively large among Japanese regional lenders, and operates branches throughout the Kantō region. In addition to branches in Miyagi, Fukushima, Chiba, Saitama, Tokyo, and Osaka prefectures, the bank also operates a representative office in Shanghai. While the bank has many stakeholders, prominent shareholders include the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, along with several major Japanese insurance companies Ibaraki Prefecture is located to the northeast of Tokyo and has a total population of 3,976,000. Although the prefecture ranks only 24th in size among Japan's 47 prefectures, it ranks 4th in terms of usable area. It is therefore one of the leading producers of agricultural products and has a largely rural population. As a consequence of this, Joyo Bank has had to maintain a large but inefficient branch network. This feature has helped the bank by limiting competition from other banks, with the result that Joyo Bank has been able to command a 38% market share of deposits and 42% share of loans in Ibaraki."

  "text" : "Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. (JNFL) (日本原燃 Nihon Gennen) is a nuclear energy company based in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture, Japan involved in the production of nuclear fuel, as well as the reprocessing, storage and disposal of nuclear waste. The mission of Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited is to establish a nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure in Japan. In uranium enrichment JNFL plans to provide for an ultimate capacity of 1,500 ton-SWU/year, enough to meet one third of the nuclear fuel needs of all nuclear power plants in Japan. The first generation Uranium Enrichment Plant in Rokkasho, Aomori operated 1992 to 2010 with a capacity of up to 1,050 ton-SWU/year, which is equivalent to the nuclear fuel used by 8 or 9 reactors at 1,000 MW-class nuclear plants. A second generation plant using centrifuges with composite carbon-fibre rotors started operating in 2011. Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, Japan's first commercial reprocessing plant, began reprocessing in 2007, however complications have delayed full commercial operation until 2012. The plant has a design reprocessing capacity of 800 tonnes-U/year, enough to reprocess the spent fuel produced by 30 reactors at 1,000 MW-class nuclear power stations, though full capacity has yet to be realized. Responding to a December 1998 request from The Federation of Electric Power Companies, JNFL has been conducting technological studies regarding MOX fuel fabrication technology. According to the current plan, Japanese electric power companies will be implementing Plutonium-Thermal utilization (MOX) with 16 to 18 of the nuclear reactors operating in Japan. In late October 2010, work formally got under way on a 130 tonne/year J-MOX fuel fabrication plant, which is located on the same site as the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. JNFL also operates low and high level nuclear waste long-term storage facilities which will accommodate 2,880 canisters of vitrified high level waste and the ultimate capacity of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Center now under construction will be 600,000 m3."

  "text" : "Jakob Lines was a ferry operator based in Jakobstad (Pietarsaari), Finland. The company was established in 1969 by the city of Jakobstad. It operated routes between Jakobstad and Kokkola (Karleby) in Finland, and Skellefteå, Umeå, and Örnsköldsvik in Sweden. Jakob Lines' first ship M/S Nordek made its first voyage for the company on September 16, 1969, on the route between Jakobstad and Umeå. The company usually operated one or two ferries at a time and in total the company operated twelve different ferries, ten of which the company owned while two were chartered. After the company was sold in 1991, the traffic was operated by the buyer Vasabåtarna. Shortly after Vasabåtarna acquired Jakob Lines, Vasabåtarna was merged with Silja Line. Silja Line gradually reduced the traffic from Jakobstad and Kokkola. Due to a part of the deal when Vasabåtarna bought Jakob Lines, Silja was obliged to maintain summer traffic from Jakobstad until tax-free sales were abolished on intra-EU travel in 1999."

The predecessor to Japan Energy was first established in 1905 as a mining company, which expanded into oil exploration in 1914. After numerous mergers and reorganizations, in 1992 the company established a separate company for its mining business called Nippon Mining & Metals, and the remaining oil company renamed itself to Japan Energy Corporation. In 2002, both companies established Nippon Mining Holdings as its holding company. In 2010, Nippon Mining merged with Nippon Oil to become JX Holdings, and the petroleum assets of both Japan Energy and Nippon Oil were reorganized into two companies, JX Nippon Oil & Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration."

Johnston pioneered the use of tweed for camouflage and the style became known as Scottish Estate Tweeds.

The Railway age in Eastern India started on 15 August 1854, exactly ninety-three years before Independence. A locomotive, carriage and wagon workshop was set up in Howrah to put to commission imported rolling stock of EIR and also to render economic repairs to them but it proved unsuccessful because of problems with procuring supplies and getting skilled labor. The railways spread very fast, perhaps faster than the anticipation of EIR. Within a short span of eight years it became necessary to shift the site of workshop, as there was hardly any scope for expansion at Howrah. And then Jamalpur Workshop was established at Jamalpur."

  "text" : "Japan Satellite Television (日本語衛星放送, ジャパンサテライトテレビ Nihongo Eisei Hōsō,) is a Japanese broadcaster in the Middle East, Europe, Russia and North Africa. Launched in March 1990 and broadcasting from London, the channel initially broadcast for two hours each night from 8pm (GMT) on the Lifestyle transponder 5 on the Astra 1A satellite in analogue format (frequency 11.273 MHz, time-sharing with The Children's Channel, Lifestyle and The Lifestyle Satellite Jukebox). Later on 3 June 1990, it started using transponder 24 on Astra 1B, at frequency 11.567 MHz for 11 hours a day, using the Videocrypt II encryption (time-sharing with The Children's Channel and later with CMT Europe). It eventually moved to transponder 53 (frequency 10.773) to broadcast 24 hours a day. Analogue transmissions for JSTV on Astra ceased on 31 October 2001. The channel currently broadcasts in DVB-S on Eutelsat Hotbird 6, encrypted in (Cryptoworks and Conax), except some programmes, and broadcasts programs of NHK, Fuji TV, TV Tokyo and other main Japanese broadcasters. News programs are mostly direct and Live from the original broadcaster, however several other programs such as Anime and Variety shows are not up to date. Not all programs are encrypted; \"News 7\", \"Newswatch 9\" and some English programs are broadcast free-to-air. JSTV consists of two channels: JSTV1 which broadcasts TV programmes, and JSTV2 which broadcasts part-time TV programmes and 24-hour Japanese radio."

  "text" : "Jerini AG was a pharmaceutical company based in Berlin, Germany, which focused on the discovery and development of novel peptide-based drugs. Using a proprietary technology platform, Peptides-to-Drugs (P2D), Jerini pursued disease indications for which limited, inadequate, or no treatment options exist. As a result, Jerini established a drug pipeline composed of its own programs as well as others in collaboration with partners. Jerini's commercialization strategy was to market new drugs in niche indications independently and in larger indications with partners. Jerini was acquired by Shire plc in 2008. Jerini started operations in 1994. Jerini's subsidiaries Jerini US Inc. and JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, provider of peptides and peptide microarrays, were acquired by Theracode GmbH, Mainz in 2009. Jerini was financed with venture capital provided by TVM and HealthCap. It went public on the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (JI4), and had raised a total of over 130 million Euro in public and private financing to date."

  "text" : "Jasc Software, Inc. was an Eden Prairie, Minnesota based company founded by Robert Voit, the creator of Paint Shop Pro, a popular graphics editing program. Jasc Software also created other popular software titles, including: \n* Image Robot \n* Animation Shop \n* Media Center Plus \n* Webdraw \n* After Shot (later released as Photo Album) On October 14, 2004, Corel Corporation announced the acquisition of Jasc Software, Inc. at announcement day, with the acquisition expected to be closed by the end of October 2004. Under the acquisition, Corel would maintain the former Jasc facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the Paint Shop family operations. Amish Mehta would continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Corel Corporation, and several members of the Jasc senior management team would join Corel. At the time of deal closure, Jasc Software, Inc. had 120 employees, with revenues of more than $30 million. On November 28, 2007, Corel announced the closure of the Minneapolis office. This effectively put an end to the former Jasc Software establishment. While a few positions remained in the Minneapolis area, most operations were transferred to Corel's other offices. \"Jasc\" is derived from the acronym, J.A.S.C. (Just Another Software Company). Founder Robert Voit needed a name to protect his assets legally, but at the time had not decided to make a go of the company so he came up with a tongue-in-cheek name. Later when the company took off, he realized that was not the best connotation for a company to have so he publicly \"changed\" the acronym to (Jets and Software Company) because he was a commercial airline pilot prior to starting the software company."

The company originated as a cigar shop in Manhattan but now chiefly operates through on-line and catalog sales; however, the company maintains three retail outlets in North Carolina, two in New Jersey (Whippany with Executive Offices, and Paramus), as well as a retail locations in Manhattan (closed), Washington DC, and Detroit, MI. The company previously traded on the NASDAQ under the trading symbol JRJR after an initial public offering in 1997. The Spanish company Altadis S.A. acquired a 51% controlling interest in the company in 2003. The company continues to operate as a subsidiary of Altadis. The company has been prosecuting significant litigation against GoTo.com (Now Overture / Yahoo - The first to bring on Pay for Placement on a search engine) on the issue of whether the use of a trademark as a paid keyword in search engine advertisement constitutes trademark infringement. To be brief, Goto.com (Overture) was selling keywords such as \"JR Cigars\", \"JR Cigar\", and other variations of \"JR Cigar\" to competing cigar retailers - thus \"illegally diverting traffic\" from a trademarked name to other sites. In the latest decision, the court held that GoTo had been making a “use” of the trademark “in commerce”, but concluded that it was unable to grant summary judgment on the issue of infringement, so that a full trial is necessary."

J&R also had a location at Columbia University, which closed in the fall of 2002. J&R later opened a J&R Express at the bottom level of Macy's Herald Square in 2006, and which was later closed in 2012. The company briefly operated a store under the name \"J&R Express\", which opened in the New York City flagship location of Century 21 in November 2014. Sometime between May and June 2016, J&R ceased their business relationship with Century with J&R Express being last recorded on the Century 21 website in an Internet Archive snapshot of March 14 and in the snapshot of the J&R website of May 5. By June 2, all mentions of J&R Express had been removed from both websites."

After the takeover Sainsbury's, many Jacksons Stores were initially refurbished to trade under the Sainsbury's at Jacksons brand. This brand was phased out and replaced with the Sainsbury's Local brand by March 2008. Shortly before the Sainsbury's acquisition the chain was voted Britain's best independent retail chain. Sainsbury's acquisition of Jacksons Stores was part of the wider controversy of the major supermarkets move into the convenience sector. The deal was not subject to a competition inquiry due to the precedent of Tesco's T&S Stores acquisition; The Office of Fair Trading took the view that the convenience sector was distinct from the supermarket sector."

  "text" : "John Rigby & Company (or John Rigby & Co. (Gunmakers) Ltd) is the oldest gunmaking firm in continuous operation in the English-speaking world. Rigby has a distinguished history of technological advancement for both sporting and military application. Rigby rifles, guns and pistols have played prominent roles throughout the British Empire and particularly in Asia and Africa. The company was established by the first John Rigby in Dublin, Ireland, apparently in 1775; his grandson, also John, opened a London branch in 1865; and Dublin operations had ceased by February 1897. The Company is now based in Vauxhall, central London, under the supervision of Managing Director, Marc Newton. In a relationship that extends back at least to 1895, John Rigby & Co. is again affiliated with Mauser GmbH and is building big game and stalking rifles on Mauser barrelled actions. In 2013, the firm resumed production of double rifles based on its Rigby-Bissell 1879 Patent rising-bite action, the first of which was completed in late 2015. Rigby also offers a serial-number research service; refurbishes vintage Rigbys for owners and collectors around the world; and maintains a Rigby collection in its showroom. One of the collection's highlights is the Rigby rifle used by Jim Corbett (1875-1955), the famous hunter of man-eating tigers and leopards in India."

The vaulting table, first introduced at the international level at the 2001 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, has been used in Gymnastics at the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The company is primarily known for its production of yearbooks and class rings for various high schools and colleges as well as championship rings for sports. Jostens also produced photobook products for Disney's PhotoPass photography service offered at Disney theme parks and resorts. Otto Josten founded the company as a watch-repair business in Owatonna, Minnesota, in 1897. As well as its headquarters near Minneapolis and operational offices in Owatonna, Jostens has facilities in Calgary, Alberta; Clarksville, Tennessee; Denton, Texas; Eagan, Minnesota; Laurens, South Carolina; Norman, Oklahoma; Sedalia, Missouri; Shelbyville, Tennessee; State College, Pennsylvania; Topeka, Kansas; Visalia, California; and Winnipeg, Manitoba. In mid 2013, Jostens released the yearbook industry's first iPad app at the National Scholastic Press Association Spring Convention in San Francisco. In April 2015, Jostens entered into an exclusive partnership with Adobe Systems to produce Monarch, the industry's first browser-based InDesign and Photoshop yearbook creation solution. On October 14, 2015, Jarden announced that it would acquire Jostens for $1.5 billion, stating that it planned to take advantage of synergies with its other properties (particularly Rawlings and Yankee Candle), and \"turn it into a true consumer-product business, as opposed to it historically being run like a printing asset\". The acquisition was completed on November 2, 2015."

  "text" : "In the 1960s, Jr. Food Mart was chartered as a subsidiary to the supermarket chain Jitney Jungle. Today, the company is an independent company with many leased locations. They operate convenience stores throughout Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. At one time, they had franchise locations from Texas to Florida, and as far north as Ohio. All the stores sell gasoline and groceries. Many of them have fast service restaurants featuring, amongst others, the well-known Creole Fried Chicken. The name and concept of spicy chicken was obtained from one of their franchisees, Sonny Adams. While the chicken recipe that Mr. Adams had created was indeed, quite spicy, it was modified and adapted to be accepted in a wide variety of locations, and the resulting flavor, while still mildly spicy, was more like the flavor of Church's Fried Chicken. This was in no small part because the Creole Fried Chicken concept was developed by Brian T. Reynolds and Shane Mitchell, whose experience in this concept came from that company. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, most of their locations were in small towns at or near the primary intersections of the communities (commonly referred to as \"Main and Main\"). At that time, the company was led by Howard Blair, its President, and Russell Stutzman, the Executive Vice President. Other notable members of the management team were Lee Crook, Director of Convenience Store Operations, and Shane Mitchell, Director of Food Service Operations. The company experienced rapid growth during this period, due to the talent of Mr. Blair in locating and securing exceptional properties and favorable lease terms for its franchisees. This combined with well-developed store designs and one of the most successful fast-food concepts of its time, made Jr. Food Mart one of the innovators of the convenience store industry during that time period. The current model of convenience store/fast food hybrids that include Mc Donald's, Taco Bell, and others into convenience store locations, can well be traced back to the successful implementation of Creole Fried Chicken into the Jr. Food Mart store designs. This chain is not related to a different chain called Jr. Food Stores that operates in south central Kentucky and northern middle Tennessee."

Organisation is a group of companies with headquarters in Delhi and run by the Singhania family which rose to prominence in Kanpur, India, under Lala Kamlapatji, a fighter for Indian independence who burnt up his stock of English cloth on the call of Mahatma Gandhi during his satyagrah call against British rule. Kamlapatji also set up the Uttar Pradesh Chamber of Commerce. The name JK is derived from the initials of Kamlapatji (1884–1937) and his father Seth Juggilal (1857–1922) who belonged to the family associated with the Marwari firm Sevaram Ramrikhdas of Mirzapur. The JK group was founded in 1918. The group rose in importance in the 1960s and 1970s when it occupied the third position as an industrial conglomerate after the Birla and Tata conglomerates. The family is currently divided into three main groups headed by 3 patriarchs namely Dr Gaur Hari Singhania based out of Kanpur, Shri Hari Shankar Singhania based out of Delhi and Shri Vijaypat Singhania, based out of Mumbai. These three patriarchs are first cousins who now run independent businesses. The Kanpur family runs JK Cements, JK Technosoft, the Delhi family runs, JK Tyre, JK Papers, JK Lakshmi Cement, Fenner India, JK Risk Managers & Insurance Brokers and the Mumbai family runs the Raymonds group of companies. To maintain the family history and legacy, the various family run companies though completely independent and many publicly owned and listed subscribe to the JK Group Logo and the oldest male member of the generation in power by tradition becomes the President of the JK Group ( The Association of Trade unions) and allots the logo to companies run by various family members as and when the apply for membership and pay an annual fee for the same. It is pertinent to note that these three different units are technically and legally separate entities and have no cross holdings and have no common directors and employees except for the shared family history."

As well, Just Us! operates a network of cafés in Nova Scotia with locations in Grand Pré, Wolfville, and Halifax. The company was founded in 1996 by Jeff and Debra Moore and 3 friends, after a visit by Jeff Moore to the mountainous coffee-producing regions of Mexico in December 1995. The name was conceived as a pun on the word justice, reflecting the motivations behind the fair trade movement. The business began as a coffee roastery in New Minas. The roastery is now located in Grand-Pre. Fair Trade remains the main focus of the business. Just Us! has extended its product line to include chocolate, teas, and sugar and expanded operations to include a fair trade chocolate factory in Grand Pré, Nova Scotia."

  "text" : "Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales is a brewery in Dexter, Michigan founded by Ron Jeffries in 2004. It operates three pubs, one in Ann Arbor, one in Detroit and the other in Traverse City. Jolly Pumpkin produces a variety of unfiltered and unpasteurized \"rustic country\" beers. Jolly Pumpkin ages their beers in wine barrels which contain naturally occurring microbiological cultures including brettanomyces. These cultures produce a complex flavor profile in their beers, which includes flavors described as leathery, earthy, wild, funky, or even \"sweaty horse hair character\", and which may approximate how some beer tasted before the advent of pasteurization and industrialization. This style of beer has been described as \"farmhouse ale\" or American wild ale. Their Oro de Calabaza won the 2004 Gold and the 2005 Bronze Medal in the Belgian- and French-style ale category at the Great American Beer Festival. Their Bam Bière won the Bronze Medal in the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and was named the 21st best beer in America by Men's Journal."

  "text" : "Jaguar Land Rover Limited  is a British multinational automotive company with its headquarters in Whitley, Coventry, United Kingdom, and a subsidiary of Indian automaker Tata Motors. Its principal activity is the design, development, manufacture and sale of vehicles bearing the Jaguar and Land Rover (including Range Rover) marques. Both marques have long and complex histories prior to their merger, going back to the 1940s, first coming together in 1968 as part of the ill-fated British Leyland conglomerate; and later existed independently of each other as subsidiaries of BMW (in the case of Land Rover), and Ford Motor Company (in the case of Jaguar); Ford later acquired Land Rover from BMW in 2000 following the break-up of the former Rover Group; which was effectively the remainder of British Leyland. Jaguar Land Rover has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors since 2008, when the latter acquired it from Ford. It sold a total of 462,678 vehicles during 2014, comprising 381,108 Land Rover vehicles and 81,570 Jaguar vehicles."

  "text" : "Jamendo is a music website and an open community of independent artists and music lovers. It bills itself as \"the world's largest digital service for free music\". Jamendo was originally introduced as a service for releasing music under the Creative Commons licenses. As of October, 2015, Jamendo no longer advertises its music as Creative Commons but rather free to play and download for personal use. The goal of Jamendo is to be the link between artists who want to share their music and audiences around the world, both private and professional. At the center of Jamendo is an economic model that grants free music downloads for web users, while at the same time providing revenue opportunities for artists through commercial uses, via the music licensing platform Jamendo Licensing which sells licenses for music synchronization and background music. Based in Luxembourg, the website has a community of over 2 million members. At the end of 2013, the catalog offered over 400,000 tracks by 30,000 artists from 150 countries. As of January 2015, the Jamendo homepage shows a count of 460,000 tracks available, and a total of 250+ million downloads since the launch of the platform. The site is available in 6 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Polish. The name \"Jamendo\" is derived from a fusion of two musical terms: \"jam session\" and \"crescendo\"."

A family business owned and operated by chef Joan McNamara and her children, Joan's started out as a catering operation running out of a storefront on Third St. As demand grew, McNamara expanded her business to include a small café and marketplace. The store tripled its size after a decade of operation, and the restaurant now includes a full menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The shop in the same space sells artisan cheeses, prepared foods, baked goods, desserts and non-perishables. Its popularity and success has grown on the strength of its products and good reviews in multiple publications and media outlets. It also has a reputation as a hip gathering spot frequented by Hollywood celebrities and foodies, such as Robert Duvall, Jake Gyllenhaal and Moon Zappa. When the lines get too long and customers are waiting, Joan has been known to rush out with a tray of cupcakes for everyone."

  "text" : "Jenapharm is a pharmaceutical company from Jena, Germany. Founded in 1950 in East Germany, the company focused from the beginning on the production and development of steroids. Due to the economic circumstances of the Eastern Bloc, the company initially used a unique process of steroid synthesis starting from hog bile, however this method was abandoned a decade later in favor of total synthesis. Initially the company produced a wide range of generic steroids, including corticosteroids, but later on it focused on anabolic steroids, estrogens and progestins. Prior to Germany's reunification Jenapharm was the only supplier of hormonal contraceptives in East Germany. It successfully marketed a number of drugs it had developed in collaboration with other East German chemists. Perhaps the most well known of these is Valette, which sold well in Germany in the 1990s. After the reunification, Jenapharm eventually became a subsidiary of Schering AG, which sold its generic therapeutics businesses to Dermapharm AG in 2004, and a year later restructured the marketing and distribution of Jenapharm into an independent subsidiary while integrating the research and development branch with its own laboratories. East Germany had been running a state-sponsored mass doping program for its athletes with anabolic steroids, mostly with Oral Turinabol, a product that Jenapharm had developed. In 2005 the company was sued or threatened with lawsuits by hundreds of athletes who were forced to take these drugs. The company settled the lawsuits by contributing to the creation of a $4.1 million fund that compensated former athletes."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with Jo-Ann Stores.) Joanne's Bed and Back is a retailer of specialty beds, mattresses, and chairs in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The chain, which is based in Beltsville, Maryland, primarily has stores in the U.S. states of Maryland and Virginia. The company also had locations in New York in the past, when two stores opened in Manhattan during the 1990s. The chain markets to those with back problems who are looking for furniture to meet their special needs. The company was founded in 1977 by Joanne Schatz, and later expanded to more than a dozen locations. The company's greatest success came during the mid-1990s, when the chain doubled its number of stores. At its height, the chain had a total of 14 stores. During the slower economic times of the 2000s, the chain's success declined. In April 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and was acquired by Virginia-based Healthy Back, which planned to close half its stores. The store closings are currently in progress."

Mathys decided to remove the bridges and counter-pivot, and instead use ball bearings for the axis."

  "text" : "John A. Brown was an Oklahoma-based department store chain. The department store had its start in 1915, when the Rorabaugh Company acquired Brock's Dry Goods in Oklahoma City, and soon changed its name to Rorabaugh-Brown Dry Goods Co. John A. Brown was acquired by the Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation) in 1971, and continued to operate under the John A. Brown name until the chain was once again acquired by Dillard's in 1984. The store's original location was in downtown Oklahoma City, and opened in the 1930s. Its location was bounded by Harvey and Robinson on the west and east, and Park and Main on the north and south.A book about Brown's, and the other main downtown Oklahoma City department stores, Kerr's and Halliburton's, was released in 2016 under the title \"John A. Brown's, Kerr's, and Halliburton's: Where Oklahoma City Loved to Shop.\" The book was written by local historians Ajax Delvecki and Larry Johnson. The company also operated many other stores throughout Oklahoma. These include locations that are either standalone or in outdoor shopping centers, such as one at Campus Corner in Norman and one in Oklahoma City's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The chain opened stores in enclosed shopping malls in its later years, including Quail Springs Mall, Penn Square Mall, and Crossroads Mall in Oklahoma City, as well as Woodland Hills Mall, Utica Square Mall and Promenade Mall in Tulsa."

  "text" : "In November 2007, Rain told the Korean media that he has left JYP Entertainment and started his own entertainment company, J. Tune Entertainment (formerly known as Rainy Entertainment). He was scheduled to be CEO of the company, but told the media that he still kept in touch with his mentor and long-time trainer Park Jin-young. In May 2008, Yeon Jung-hoon signed with J.Tune Entertainment after his military discharge. In 2009, J. Tune Entertainment had a female trainee who was claimed by the Korean media to be the female version of Rain. The unknown female was dismissed by the company for unspecified reasons. In July 2010, Rain reportedly sold his shares of J. Tune Entertainment to his mentor Park Jin-Young. In December 2010, Park Jin-Young announced that J. Tune Entertainment would be merged with JYP Entertainment. JYP Entertainment become the largest shareholder in J. Tune Entertainment and it is viewed as a strategic alliance between the two companies. In 2011, Rain announced that he will be enlisted in the army. In June 2011, Yung Jung Hoon left J. Tune Entertainment to sign a contract with DBM Entertainment, joining the same company as long-time friend and fellow actress Lee Da-hae.

  "text" : "Jatheon Technologies, Inc. is a privately held company founded in 2004 providing e-mail and information archiving network appliances. The company is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company was the first in the industry to introduce an email archiving appliance that operated primarily through packet sniffing technology to capture messaging traffic off of a company's network in a non-intrusive manner. Jatheon's email and information archiving appliances capture, index and store email and instant messages to enable organizations to meet eDiscovery and email archiving compliance requirements, including those from SEC, NASD, HIPAA, FRCP, and Sarbanes Oxley. The email archiving network appliances are installed in an organization's network and capture messaging traffic within the network. They are compatible with all major mail servers, including Exchange, Office 365, Notes, Gmail, and Groupwise. On June 24, 2014 Jatheon Technologies re-designed its entire family of PnC based email and message archiving solutions for companies seeking full regulatory compliance, internal policy management, storage space management, and e-discovery. This product refresh establishes a new naming convention. They call the new products the cCore™ family of appliances. On April 1, 2014, Jatheon Technologies announced the appointment of Pierre Villeneuve as its new President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierre is a seasoned entrepreneur and business leader with over 30 years experience starting and growing small to medium-sized businesses involved in the development of software solutions and applications in technology driven businesses. On March 3, 2010, the company launched a remote system monitoring service that remotely monitors the health of hard disc drives and RAID, storage use and disc space, physical temperature, file system, email processing, event logs, and system performance of installed appliances. On December 1, 2009, the company announced a partnership with Dell. Under the partnership, four new products combining Dell's PowerEdge R610 and R710 server technology, Dell's PowerVault MD1000 storage arrays, and Jatheon's email archiving and management software in 3TB, 6TB, 12TB and 24TB virtual storage configurations were launched. On June 17, 2009, the company acquired the ongoing operations and support of NorthSeas AMT customers."

  "text" : "J-W Operating Company was founded on November 10, 1960, by Thomas Jeffrey and Howard G. Westerman. In 1960, the principal owners of two water flood units in Arkansas, who could not agree on which of them should operate the units, offered the job to Howard Westerman. Dr. Ralph Connell loaned the money to Jeffrey and Westerman to start a new company. This laid the foundation for what would develop into a company specializing in contract operations, and Dr. Connell has since been affectionately been known as the dash in the \"J - W\". The company was contracted to drill brine wells and build a gathering system to deliver brine to a local bromine plant and dispose of the wastewater. In 1962, Thomas Jeffrey returned to his passion of independent consulting, and Howard Westerman became the controlling owner and chief executive officer of J-W Operating Company. Over the years, Mr. Westerman's endeavors spawned numerous patents and trademarks, including the Superburn compressor with a two-cycle stratified engine. Owning and operating pipelines and compressors opened the door to the oil-and-gas exploration and production business with discoveries in Northeast Colorado and Northern Louisiana. In 1983, he created Cohort Energy Company to handle the exploration and production operations. In the late 80s, he ventured into power generation from landfill gas. In the 90s, he implemented an aggressive growth strategy and complemented his staff with professional managers whose charge was to double the size of J-W Operating Company. In September 2010, the company was restructured and was essentially renamed J-W Energy Company to better reflect the company's current scope of services."

  "text" : "Jura Elektroapparate AG is a Swiss developer and distributor of home appliances, headquartered in Niederbuchsiten, Canton of Solothurn. The company was founded in 1931 by Leo Henzirohs. Formerly, Jura ran its own factory, but it has outsourced production since the 1990s. Jura is currently best known for its fully automatic espresso machines. This core area originated in the early 1980s and is nowadays a main element of the brand image as well as creating most of its sales. A strong focus is laid on design and there are no low-budget machines. The espresso machines are produced by Eugster/Frismag in Romanshorn, which company also manufactures machines for other brands such as Siemens, Bosch and AEG. Jura used to be well known as a producer of other home appliances too, especially clothes irons. At the end of 2008, Jura has generally ceased distributing its ironing product range, except in its home market of Switzerland where they still offer a limited range of \"classic\" products such as irons, a toaster in retro style, and a pretzel iron (\"Bräzeleisen\"). The automatic espresso machines are distributed worldwide. In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and in Australia Jura has its own distribution companies or joint ventures. This is also the case for Central Eastern Europe. Jura's brand ambassador is Roger Federer. In 2006, Jura inaugurated the visitor's centre \"JURAworld of Coffee\" at the Niederbuchsiten headquarters."

In 1854 the company supplied a twin cylinder horizontal winding engine, and in 1861 a single cylinder pumping engine to Chanters Colliery in Hindsford. Musgraves supplied winding engines to Wheatsheaf Colliery in 1868, Mosley Common Colliery in 1870, Brackley Colliery in 1879, Gin Pit Colliery in 1884,  and Nook Colliery in 1913. The company produced steam engines during the 19th century and between 1899 and 1908 produced 504 large steam-driven engines for textile mills in Lancashire. The company produced engines and equipment for the coal mining industry and built a boilerworks in Westhoughton in 1900 to produce Lancashire boilers. The Westhoughton works were subject to a chancery court judgement and sold in 1912 leading to the formation of John Musgrave and Sons (1913) Ltd. which kept the Globe Ironworks. The company produced munitions during World War I. The business closed in 1926; its drawings and patterns were taken over by W & J Galloway & Sons. A final notice of winding-up was published on 11 March 1927."

They pioneered recycling-based junk removal in the franchise industry, and in 2012, the Company expanded into Canada under the Junk Works brand to reflect its commitment to reuse, recycle, or donate high percentages of items collected. As of February 2016 the company has helped over 70 franchises open in the United States and Canada, including Atlanta, Sacramento, San Antonio, Boston, Los Angeles, Dallas, and San Diego. Junk King is also currently the highest ranked service brand in North America, with an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 90% (Listen 360, Atlanta, GA).

It also publishes series from external associate editors, e.g., Christoph Keller Editions. At the core of JRP|Ringier’s program lie the books by contemporary artists themselves: the artists’ books. JRP|Ringier has already published influential artists such as Fischli & Weiss, John Armleder, Isa Genzken, Richard Prince, John Baldessari, Mike Kelley, Wolfgang Tillmans, Elaine Sturtevant or Rodney Graham. However the publisher continues to support younger or still overlooked Swiss and international artists, including Urs Fischer, Valentin Carron, Sterling Ruby, Troy Brauntuch, Tony Oursler, Kelley Walker, Mai-Thu Perret or Cyprien Gaillard. JRP|Ringier’s publications have won numerous design awards, including The Most Beautiful Swiss Book and Best Book Design from all over the World. While the Geneva-based studio  is responsible for the art direction, other renowned graphic designers such as Norm, M/M Paris, Cornel Windlin,  or Peter Saville have also contributed titles from JRP|Ringier’s catalogue."

  "text" : "The James Hutton Institute is an interdisciplinary scientific research institute in Scotland established in 2011, through the merger of Scottish Crop Research Institute (SCRI) and the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute. The institute, named after Scottish geologist James Hutton, one of the leading figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, combines existing Scottish expertise in agricultural research, soils and land use, and will make contributions to issues including food and energy security, biodiversity, and climate change. With more than 600 employees, the new institute is among the largest research centres in the UK. The Institute has its main offices in Aberdeen and Dundee with farms and field research stations at Glensaugh, Hartwood and Balruddery. The Dundee site also hosts the Plant Sciences department of the University of Dundee. The James Hutton Institute also formally contains Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS) which has staff based in Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Ayr. BioSS undertakes research, consultancy and training in mathematics and statistics as applied to agriculture, the environment, food and health. Strategic oversight of the development of BioSS is provided by a Strategic Planning Group composed of senior representatives from BioSS' principal stakeholders. BioSS and the James Hutton Institute are two of a family of six organisations termed the Main Research Providers for the Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analytical Services Division (RESAS). In 2012 the Institute announced that it was formally joining the Natural Capital Initiative, a leading UK partnership that brings together policymakers, scientists, business, industry to find the most effective ways safeguard important ecosystems and natural capital."

The company was founded in 2004 to provide the opportunity for employees in China's service industry to learn and gain skills to help them in their daily working lives. China's strength as a manufacturer has left its service industry underdeveloped by comparison and the Beijing government is focused on growth in the standards and importance of this industry sector. Additionally, many individuals and graduates in China lack the practical experience and skills required for a service industry career, and are often particularly appreciative of the opportunity to learn through training."

  "text" : "The John Galt Corporation is a demolition and construction contractor based in New York City, which was subcontracted to demolish the Deutsche Bank Building after the building suffered severe damage during the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The company was involved in multiple scandals related to its work at the site. The company was founded in 1983 and named for a character from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. The company had apparently done no substantial work of any kind until it was subcontracted by Bovis Lend Lease to demolish the Deutsche Bank Building. The company essentially acted as a shell corporation for the Regional Scaffolding and Hoisting Company and two former Safeway Environmental Corporation executives. The use of a shell corporation is not unusual within the demolition industry, but the participation of Safeway Environmental executives drew attention because of past problems that company had with government contracts, including accusations of ties to criminal organizations. Three of the company's construction supervisors (Mitchel Alvo, Salvatore DePaola, and Jeffrey Melofchik) were charged for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide as a result of the deaths of two firefighters in a fire which broke out in August 2007. The John Galt Corporation was also charged. Alvo was acquitted in a bench trial; DePaola and Melofchik were cleared in a jury trial. The company was acquitted of manslaughter, but was convicted of second-degree reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor. In a separate case, one of the company's purchasing agents, Robert Chiarappa, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for embezzling over 1.2 million dollars from the building's demolition. Three other people also plead guilty for their involvement in the scheme."

The company provided independent game developers early-stage seed funding, mentoring, education and networking. In return, Joystick Labs took equity in the companies, but studios retained some creative control and ownership of the intellectual property. The video game industry shifting to digitally distributed games has lowered the barriers to entry and required funding for an independent studio. Joystick Labs helps studios develop their digitally distributed game and enter the market with knowledge of the industry. Teams at Joystick Labs took part in a three month session where they work to maximize their chances for commercial success by learning from mentors with video game industry experience. Mentors that have worked with teams at Joystick Labs include individuals from Triangle area video game companies, such as Epic Games and Red Storm Entertainment. Based in Durham, N.C., Joystick Labs teams worked at offices located in the American Tobacco Campus."

JWA was founded by Gail Twersky Reimer in 1995 in Brookline, Massachusetts with the goal of using the Internet to increase awareness of and provide access to the stories of American Jewish women. JWA makes a growing collection of information, exhibits, and resources available via its website. Its activities include the conception, production and dissemination of: \n*  Community-based oral history projects \n*  Online exhibitions \n*  Original academic research \n*  Educational materials including curricula, a poster series and an oral history guide \n*  Training Institutes for educators working in formal and informal settings \n*  Documentary film Starting in 2010, JWA also began holding an Annual Luncheon in New York City at which it honors three women for their activism and achievements. In 2010 the focus was on the Triangle Fire (2010 was the centenary of that tragedy). Honorees included Ruth J. Abram (co-founder of the Tenement Museum), Kate Frucher (attorney and entrepreneur), and journalist Lynn Sherr. In 2011 the luncheon was titled \"Making Trouble / Making History.\" Gloria Steinem presented the awards, which were given to Elizabeth A. Sackler (The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Brooklyn Museum), Rebecca Traister (author, Big Girls Don't Cry, journalist), and Letty Cottin Pogrebin (author, \"Deborah, Golda, and Me,\" etc., journalist, founding editor, \"Ms magazine\")."

  "text" : "Jade Magnet is an online Crowdsourcing platform for creative and marketing support services. It was founded in 2009 by Sitashwa Srivastava and Manik Kinra. The company is headquartered in Bangalore, India and has white label partnerships in Qatar as Mixilion and in Singapore as id8on. Jade Magnet crowdsources design requirements for marketing campaigns (logos, websites, brochures, print ads, animation videos) to freelancers, professionals, small agencies and technology from teams across the world. Initially established as an open crowdsourcing platform, Jade Magnet moved to a “managed Crowdsourcing” model in 2013 wherein the company curates teams of designers from the crowd to provide solutions to its clients’. It offers delivery assurance to its clients and handles the full project management, payments and legal contracts of crowdsourced output. Crowdsourcing gives businesses the option of choosing from multiple design possibilities, while at the same time, creates money-making opportunities for those with a creative bent-of-mind and a technology background. Businesses sourcing marketing and design requirements from Jade Magnet get to select from multiple designs submitted by different designers or “providers” to whom the task gets posted as a contest. In this way, the platform enables customers to extract multiple options for creative solutions before making a final selection. Crowdsourcing designers also makes available a larger pool of the best available talent from among freelancers, who would otherwise not be available within a single organisation or agency. Designers can apply to become providers on the Jade Magnet network, and are then invited participate in live internal contests the ones that are of interest to them. Jade Magnet also sources designers and artists by visiting art schools and design colleges where there is a ready community willing to participate in any invitation for crowdsourcing ideas. Providers who perform well on projects and receive good customer feedback can become Jade Magnet Champions, which ensures them a steady stream of projects. Jade Magnet has developed a community engagement system for all providers (students, moonlighters, small agencies and freelancers), offering introductory skill appraisals, appraisal and accreditation based on client feedback and opportunities for creative skill enhancement. Some Jade Magnet providers are based in tier-2 cities of India and make a living with work coming from the platform."

Jiepang helps users record and track all of their life activities, connect with friends in specific moments and explore communities of people that have similar interests. In the past, Jiepang was highly similar to Foursquare and was frequently called the Foursquare of China. But the redesign of Jiepang 5.0 pivots the app away from that reference. The service was created in 2010 by David Liu (刘大卫), and is available in simplified and traditional Chinese characters as well as English. As of July 2013, it had 5 million users."

  "text" : "JK Lasers was a global laser manufacturer based in Rugby, Warwickshire, England. Established by Ron Burbeck and Dr Jim Wright MBE in 1972, the company first launched a range of pulsed lasers using ruby, YAG and glass laser rods. This was followed by the MS-Series of Nd:YAG laser systems, designed for industrial welding, cutting and drilling applications. In 1982, JK Lasers was acquired by Lumonics of Canada to form one of the largest laser companies in the world.Lumonics merged with General Scanning Incorporated (GSI) in 1999 and, following the sale of the Lumonics brand, the laser segment of the business changed its name to the GSI Group Laser Division. Under this name, the company launched its first rack-mountable ytterbium industrial fiber lasers in 2007. The GSI Group Laser Division completed a rebrand back to JK Lasers in August 2012. General Manager Dr Mark Greenwood said: “The rebrand to JK Lasers is an important step for us. It is a return to our roots; a recognition of our long and successful history.” JK Lasers range of products includes watt to kilowatt fiber lasers, CO2 lasers, Nd:YAG lasers, process tools and software. Its first multi-kiloWatt class of fiber lasers, the JK2000FL, was launched in April 2012. In April 2015 GSI sold it's JK Lasers subsidiary to SPI Lasers, part of the Trumpf group. All products were rebranded with the SPI logo essentially ending the JK brand."

  "text" : "Juwai.com is China's largest international property website for Chinese buyers and was launched in 2011. It aims to provide a portal for overseas real estate marketers to reach Chinese property buyers, which purchased an estimated $50 billion in overseas real estate in 2012, up from $28 billion in 2011. Compared to competitors, Juwai.com has twice the page rank and seven times the number of pages indexed by leading Chinese property portal, Baidu.com. The consumer side of the website is in simplified and traditional Chinese, featuring residential and commercial property listings from 58 countries. The client side, list.juwai.com, is in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. It allows agents and developers from around the world to load their listings with property details and photos. Members of the real estate industry say there is a \"huge need\" for Juwai.com because agents are looking for buyers, and Chinese buyers want to spend billions on property in other countries.

  "text" : "Tangshan Jidong Cement Co., Ltd. SZSE: 000401 is a Chinese cement manufacturing company, ranked the 6th largest manufacturer of cement in the world by Global Cement Magazine based on 2011 data. The cement maker is part of the Jidong Development Group, a holding company with interests in machinery, real estate, and production of other construction materials. Jidong expanded outside of China for the first time in 2010 when it entered into a deal to build a new cement plant in Limpopo, South Africa. The 221 million USD investment was funded by a consortium that included the China Africa Development Fund, Chinese commercial banks, and Nedbank, along with equity stakes by Continental Cement and Women Investment Portfolio Holdings. In an interview with The Financial Times, Chen Ying, an executive of Jidong Development Group, explained that the investment was driven by his belief that Africa would progress and grow as fast as China. Before the investment, in 2007 Jidong and Women Investment Portfolio Holdings, a black women empowerment themed fund, had already partnered up to deliver Dunshi branded cement in South Africa. The new plant was enthusiastically welcomed by South African publication Moneyweb which predicted the new facility would \"shake [the] industry to its foundations\" because it would shatter the \"old cement cartel\"."

Byron, which at the time comprised 12 stores, in 1968. They sold the chain in 1985. Their commercials featured the jingle \"The right look, the right price, JByrons\" (changed to \"at Byrons\" after the name changed). Later commercials featured the jingle \"At Byrons the magic, the magic is in low prices.\" In 1991, the chain dropped the \"J\" from its name. Five years later, 17 of the Byrons stores were closed, and the remaining 37 were sold to Uptons."

  "text" : "The company Jaques Limited was an engineering manufacturing company based in Melbourne, Australia, which was founded by Edward Jaques in 1888. Jaques' family had fled Revolutionary France and eventually immigrated to Australia in 1876. In 1885 Edward finished his engineering apprenticeship in Melbourne prior to forming a company with Edwin Phillips as Phillips and Jaques, producing rock crushers for quarries. The partnership was dissolved in 1888 and Edward went into partnership with his brother Wallace in 1917 as Jaques Brothers Proprietary Limited. Jaques Brothers became a public company in 1949, and on 22 March 1973 it changed its name to Jaques Limited. It was taken over by Clyde Industries Ltd on 19 September 1979. The firm became a world leader in the design and manufacture of stone crushers as well as producing road making machinery and excavators. In 1979 Jaques produced the tunnel boring machine known as the mole, used in construction of the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop under the supervision of managing director Jack Keegan, from design drawings acquired from Italy. In 2001, Jaques was absorbed by the Terex Corporation. The main manufacturing plant in Palmer Street Richmond was sold in 1997, and the site redeveloped as a residential and commercial area under the name as Jaques Richmond."

  "text" : "J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company was one of the largest and best known manufacturers of glass in the United States in the 19th century. Its products were distributed world-wide. The company is responsible for one of the greatest innovations in American glassmaking—an improved formula for lime glass that enabled American glass makers to produce high-quality glass at a lower cost. The firm also developed many of the talented glassmakers that started glass factories in Ohio and Indiana. The firm was first organized as Barnes and Hobbs in 1845 by James B. Barnes and John L. Hobbs. Both men held supervisory positions at the New England Glass Company in Massachusetts before starting their business venture. They came to a small community near the south side of Wheeling, Virginia, to begin their new glassmaking company. The firm was reorganized multiple times during the next half century, but members of the Hobbs family were always part of the ownership. The most famous iteration of the company was named J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company. This version of the firm was organized in 1863 as a co-partnership between John L. Hobbs, son John H. Hobbs, and Charles W. Brockunier. Its products were mostly pressed and blown tableware. In 1891, the Hobbs glass works joined the United States Glass Company trust. The trust controlled over a dozen glass plants. In 1893, the glass works was closed. It remained closed until 1902 when the property was sold to Harry Northwood—a former employee of J. H. Hobbs, Bruckunier and Company."

  "text" : "The Jumbuck Pastoral Company is an Australian company that operates numerous cattle stations and sheep stations in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory It is one of the largest landowners in Australia and the biggest wool grower. Jumbuck controls over 50,000 square kilometres (19,305 sq mi) of holdings which run approximately 411,000 head of sheep and 456,000 head of cattle. The company is a privately held company owned by the MacLachlan family and is based in Adelaide. It was established in 1888 by H. P. MacLachlan who was known for his ability with stock and being able to ride out a drought. Initially the company was interested in wool growing in the arid at Paratoo Station near Yunta. Eventually it diversified into cattle. By the mid-1920s MacLachlan's son, B. H. MacLachlan, was running the company after his father had loaned him £16,000 to acquire and develop lands in the Tarcoola area. When MacLachlan Senior died in 1939, B. H. continued to expand the development plan with Commonwealth Hill Station and Mulgathing Station shearing over 100,000 sheep in 1945. B.H. MacLachlan handed over to his son, H.G. (Hugh) MacLachlan in 1960. Hugh took up pastoral leases in Western Australia at Rawlinna Station and Madura Plains. The company was fined A$100,000 in 2005 following the death of a jackaroo in New South Wales in 2001. Hugh MacLachlan stepped down as the managing director of the company in 2009 after nearly half a century in the role. Both his sons, Jock and Callum, were appointed as joint managing directors. In 2014 the company acquired Killarney Station in the Northern Territory for about A$35 million. The property occupied an area of 2,819 square kilometres (1,088 sq mi) and supports a herd of approximately 26,000 cattle."

Just Aircraft is a limited liability company. Woodland had worked at Flying K Enterprises, the manufacturer of the Flying K Sky Raider, but left to start his own company to market his own designs, partnering with investor Gary Schmitt. The company collaborated with the British company Escapade Aircraft in the design of the Escapade. Woodland next designed the Just Highlander, a development of the Escapade incorporating a larger wing mounting high-lift devices, a larger fin and elevators, balanced tail control surfaces and a strengthened conventional undercarriage. The Just Superstol is a further development of the same line with an emphasis on STOL performance onto unprepared surfaces. In 2004 the company relocated to Walhalla, South Carolina. By 2013 the Highlander outsold the Escapade line by 10:1, with about one third of sales being outside the US."
