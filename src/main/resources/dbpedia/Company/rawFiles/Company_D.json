  "text" : "Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s. DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007 some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name."

  "text" : "Datsun is an automobile brand owned by Nissan. Datsun's original production run began in 1931. From 1958 to 1986, only vehicles exported by Nissan were identified as Datsun. By 1986 Nissan had phased out the Datsun name, but re-launched it in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. In 1931, Dat Motorcar Co. chose to name its new small car \"Datson\", a name which indicated the new car's smaller size when compared to the DAT's larger vehicle already in production. When Nissan took control of DAT in 1934, the name \"Datson\" was changed to \"Datsun\", because \"son\" also means \"loss\" (損 Son) in Japanese and also to honor the sun depicted in the national flag. Nissan phased out the Datsun brand in March 1986. The Datsun name is most famous for the 510, Fairlady roadsters, and later the Fairlady (240Z) coupes."

Among its founding fathers was Willem Usselincx (1567–1647). On June 3, 1621, it was granted a charter for a trade monopoly in the West Indies (meaning the Caribbean) by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the Dutch colonization of the Americas."

  "text" : "The United East Indian Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie; VOC), referred to by the British as the Dutch East India Company, was originally established as a chartered company in 1602, when the Dutch government granted it a 21-year monopoly on Dutch spice trade. It is often considered to have been the first multinational corporation in the world  and it was the first company to issue stock. It was a powerful company, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asia trade. Between 1602 and 1796 the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century. Having been set up in 1602, to profit from the Malukan spice trade, in 1619 the VOC established a capital in the port city of Jayakarta changing the name to Batavia (now Jakarta). Over the next two centuries the Company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. It remained an important trading concern and paid an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years. Weighed down by corruption in the late 18th century, the company went bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1800, its possessions and the debt being taken over by the government of the Dutch Batavian Republic. The VOC's territories became the Dutch East Indies and were expanded over the course of the 19th century to include the whole of the Indonesian archipelago, and in the 20th century would form the Republic of Indonesia."

  "text" : "Dodge is an American brand of cars, minivans, and sport utility vehicles manufactured by FCA US LLC (formerly known as Chrysler Group LLC), based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles currently include the lower-priced badge variants of Chrysler-badged vehicles as well as performance cars, though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth. Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in late 1900, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the \"Dodge Brothers\" brand in 1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory was located in Hamtramck, Michigan and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until 1979. The Dodge brothers both died of complications due to influenza in 1920 and the company was sold to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. Dodge vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it did make some inroads into the compact car market during this time. The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan. The Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its short-lived merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007, its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management, its 2009 bailout by the United States government, and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat. In 2011, Dodge, Ram, and Dodge's Viper were separated. Dodge said that the Dodge Viper will now be an SRT product and Ram will be a manufacturer. In 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, corresponding with the merger of Fiat S.p.A. and Chrysler Group into the single corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles."

The company is currently active in open-pit, large-scale alluvial, coastal and deep sea mining. The company operates in 28 countries and mining takes place in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada. Until the start of the 21st century, De Beers effectively had total control over the diamond market as both a monopoly and monopsony of diamonds. Opposition has since dismantled the complete monopoly, though De Beers is still a large shareholder and currently sells approximately 35% of the world’s rough diamond production through its Global Sightholder Sales and Auction Sales businesses. The company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild & Sons bank. In 1926, Ernest Oppenheimer, a German immigrant to Britain who had earlier founded mining giant Anglo American plc with American financier J.P. Morgan, was elected to the board of De Beers. He built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the diamond industry until his death in 1957. During this time, he was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing, antitrust behaviour and an allegation of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during World War II."

Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. Gibson Guitar Corporation acquired the Dobro trademark in 1994. Although the name Dobro is generically associated with the single-inverted-cone design, Gibson has announced that it would defend its right to exclusively use the name."

  "text" : "Daimler-Benz AG (German pronunciation: [ˈdaɪ̯mlɐ ˈbɛnt͡s]) was a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and internal combustion engines; founded in 1926. An Agreement of Mutual Interest - which was valid until 2000 - was signed on 1 May 1924 between Karl Benz's Benz & Cie., and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, which had been founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Daimler had died in 1900, and Maybach had left in 1907. Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until, on 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft formally merged - becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) - and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of \"Mercedes-Benz\" on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG's directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named Daimler-Mercedes, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name, Mercedes, had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909. The name of Daimler as a marque of automobiles had been sold by DMG - following his death in 1900 - for use by other companies (Daimler Motor Company and Austro-Daimler), so the new company, Daimler-Benz, would have created confusion and legal problems to include Daimler in its new brand name, and therefore, used Mercedes to represent the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft interest. Karl Benz remained as a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz AG until his death in 1929. Although Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II it also created a notable series of aircraft, tank, and submarine engines. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for the Mauser rifle. During World War II Daimler-Benz employed slave labour. The slaves \"toiled eighteen hours a day; cowering under the lash, sleeping six to a dog kennel eight feet square, starving or freezing to death at the whim of their guards.\" In 1989 Daimler-Benz InterServices AG (Debis) was created to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group. In 1998, Daimler-Benz AG bought the American automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. When the Chrysler Group was subsequently sold off to Cerberus Capital Management and renamed Chrysler LLC in August 2007, the name of the parent company was changed to simply Daimler AG within two months."

The company provides satellite television, satellite Internet access, audio programming, and interactive television services to commercial and residential customers in the United States. As of April 2016, the company provided services to 13.9 million television and 628,000 broadband subscribers. The company has approximately 18,000 employees. The company is headquartered in Meridian, Colorado, though the postal designation of nearby Englewood, Colorado is used in the corporate mailing address. In January 2008, Dish Network was spun off from its former parent company EchoStar, which was founded by Charlie Ergen as a satellite television equipment distributor in 1980. The company began using Dish Network as its consumer brand in March 1996, after the successful launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I, in December 1995. That launch marked the beginning of its subscription television services, and EchoStar has since launched numerous satellites, with nine owned and leased satellites in its fleet as of January 2013. EchoStar continues to be the primary technology partner to Dish Network. Joseph Clayton became president and chief executive officer of the company in June 2011, while Charlie Ergen remained chairman. Clayton remained in the position until March 31, 2015 when he retired leaving Ergen to resume the post. Ergen has said diversifying and updating technology for the company will be a high priority, with an expectation that, over the coming decade, the company will provide internet, video, and telephone service for both home and mobile applications."

  "text" : "Digital Research, Inc. (a.k.a. DR or DRI; originally Intergalactic Digital Research) was the company created by Dr. Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related products. It was the first large software company in the microcomputer world. Digital Research was based in Pacific Grove, California. The company's operating systems, starting with CP/M for 8080/Z80-based microcomputers, were the de facto standard of their era, as MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows came later. DR's product suite included the original CP/M and its various offshoots; DR-DOS which was a MS-DOS compatible version of CP/M, and MP/M, the multi-user CP/M. The first 16-bit system was CP/M-86, which was to be unsuccessful in competition with MS-DOS. There followed Concurrent CP/M, a single-user version of the multi-tasking MP/M-86 featuring \"virtual consoles\" from which applications could be launched to run concurrently. Successive revisions of this system, which gradually supported MS-DOS applications and the FAT filesystem, were labelled Concurrent DOS, Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386. In May 1983 Digital announced that it would offer PC DOS versions of all of its languages and utilities. It remained influential, with $45 million in 1983 sales making Digital the fourth-largest microcomputer software company. Admitting that it had \"lost\" the 8088 software market but hoped to succeed with the Intel 80286 and Motorola 68000, by 1984 the company formed a partnership with AT&T Corporation to develop software for Unix System V and sell its own and third-party products in retail stores. Jerry Pournelle warned later that year, however, that \"Many people of stature seem to have left or are leaving Digital Research. DR had better get its act together.\" In 1985, soon after the introduction of the Intel 80286, Digital introduced a real-time system, initially called Concurrent DOS 286 and subsequently FlexOS. This exploited the greater memory addressing capability of the new CPU to provide a more flexible multi-tasking environment. There was a small but powerful set of system APIs, each with a synchronous and an asynchronous variant. Pipes were supported, and all named resources could be aliased by setting Environment variables. This system was to enjoy enduring favour in point-of-sale systems and was adopted by the IBM 4690 OS. Digital Research was purchased by Novell in 1991, primarily for Novell to gain access to the operating system line. DR produced a selection of programming language compilers and interpreters for their OS-supported platforms, including C, Pascal, COBOL, Forth, PL/I, PL/M, CBASIC, BASIC, and Logo. They also produced a microcomputer version of the GKS graphics standard (related to NAPLPS) called GSX, and later used this as the basis of their GEM GUI. Less known are their application programs, limited largely to the GSX-based DR DRAW, Dr. Halo for DOS and a small suite of GUI programs for GEM."

  "text" : "Dell Inc. (stylized as DELL) was an American privately owned multinational computer technology company based in Round Rock, Texas, United States, that developed, sold, repaired, and supported computers and related products and services. Eponymously named after its founder, Michael Dell, the company was one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people worldwide. Dell sold personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, MP3 players, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company was well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its \"build-to-order\" or \"configure to order\" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions for enterprise customers. Dell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list, until 2014. After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2015, it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP. Dell is currently the #1 shipper of PC monitors in the world. Dell is the sixth largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine. It is the second largest non-oil company in Texas – behind AT&T – and the largest company in the Greater Austin area. It was a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500, until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30, 2013. On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. acquired EMC Corporation to form Dell Technologies, restructuring the original company as a subsidiary of Dell Technologies."

  "text" : "Data General was one of the first minicomputer firms from the late 1960s. Three of the four founders were former employees of Digital Equipment Corporation. Their first product, the Data General Nova, was a 16-bit minicomputer. This used their own operating system, Data General RDOS (DG/RDOS), and in conjunction with programming languages like \"Data General Business Basic\" they provided a multi-user operating system with record locking and built-in databases far ahead of many contemporary systems. The Nova was followed by the Supernova and Eclipse product lines, all of which were used in many applications for the next two decades. The company employed an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) sales strategy to sell to third parties who incorporated Data General computers into the OEM's specific product lines. A series of missteps in the 1980s, including missing the advance of microcomputers despite the launch of the microNOVA in 1977, and the Data General-One portable computer in 1984, led to a decline in the company's market share. The company did continue into the 1990s, however, and was eventually acquired by EMC Corporation in 2002."

  "text" : "The DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) is an American automobile manufacturer originally formed by automobile industry executive John DeLorean in 1975. It is remembered for the one model it produced — the distinctive stainless steel DeLorean DMC-12 sports car featuring gull-wing doors—and for its brief and turbulent history, ending in receivership and bankruptcy in 1982. Near the end, in a desperate attempt to raise the funds his company needed to survive, John DeLorean was filmed appearing to accept money to take part in drug trafficking, but was subsequently acquitted of charges brought against him on the basis of entrapment. The DeLorean DMC-12 featured memorably in the Back to the Future movie trilogy, as the model of car made into a time machine by eccentric scientist Doc Brown, although the company had ceased to exist before the first movie was made. In 1995, Liverpool-born mechanic Stephen Wynne started a separate company using the \"DeLorean Motor Company\" name and shortly thereafter acquired the remaining parts inventory and the stylized \"DMC\" logo trademark of DeLorean Motor Company. The current DeLorean Motor Company located in Humble near Houston, Texas is not, and has never been, associated with the original company, but supports owners of DeLorean cars. DMC Texas, as they are known, has an additional five authorized, franchised dealers in Bonita Springs, Florida; Crystal Lake, Illinois; Huntington Beach, California; Bellevue, Washington and Hem, Netherlands."

However, the company's contracts are managed from its office at Alliance Airport in Fort Worth, Texas. The company has provided services for the U.S. military in several theaters, including Bolivia, Bosnia, Somalia, Angola, Haiti, Colombia, Kosovo and Kuwait. DynCorp International also provided much of the security for Afghan interim president Hamid Karzai's presidential guard and trains much of Afghanistan's and Iraq's fledgling police force. DynCorp was also hired to assist recovery in Louisiana and neighboring areas after Hurricane Katrina. DynCorp has held one contract on every round of competition since receiving the first Contract Field Teams contract in 1951. DynCorp won the LOGCAP II contract and is one of three contract holders on the current LOGCAP IV contract."

As of 2014, Dow ranked third in chemical production (after BASF and Sinopec), and as of 2015, was the third largest chemical company in the world by revenue (after Sinopec and BASF). Dow was also the world's largest chlorine producer, with 5.7 billion tons a year of production before Dow's association with Olin was formed; was ranked as the world's largest plastics manufacturer during 2008, and the largest manufacturer of polyalkylene glycols in 2013. Dow's principal lines of business include Agricultural Sciences, Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions, Performance Materials & Chemicals, and Performance Plastics. It employs approximately 53,000 people worldwide. Dow's 2014 sales totaled approximately $58.2 billion. Dow has been called the \"chemical companies' chemical company\" in that most of its sales are to other industries rather than end users, although Dow sells directly to end users primarily in the human and animal health, agriculture, and consumer products markets. The company was founded in 1897 by Canadian-born chemist Herbert Henry Dow. After a period of diversification, it became a major chemical company, a significant player in the world market, and a part of the military-industrial war effort during both World Wars."

  "text" : "Diebold was an American financial self-service, security and services corporation. A part of Diebold Nixdorf since August 2016, the entity is internationally engaged primarily in the sale, manufacture, installation and service of self-service transaction systems (such as ATMs), electronic and physical security products (including vaults and currency processing systems), software and related services for global financial and commercial markets. Founded in 1859 in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company, after becoming incorporated in Ohio in 1876 the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company. Currently headquartered in the Akron-Canton area with facilities in nearby Green, in 1921 Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank. Diebold has since branched into diverse markets, and is currently the largest provider of ATMs in the United States. With 2015 revenues of US$2.42 billion, Diebold acquired Germany's Wincor Nixdorf in 2016, integrating it to form Diebold Nixdorf. It is estimated that Diebold Nixdorf controls about 35 percent of the global ATM market."

  "text" : "Demon Internet is a British Internet Service Provider currently operating as a brand of Vodafone. It was one of the UK's earliest ISPs, offering dial-up Internet access services from 1 June 1992. In 1998 Demon was bought by Scottish Telecom, a wholly owned subsidiary of the private utility company Scottish Power. Scottish Telecom rebranded as Thus plc in October 1999 and floated on the London Stock Exchange. Thus plc fully demerged from Scottish Power in 2002. Thus became part of Cable & Wireless plc, and then part of Cable & Wireless Worldwide following a split of its parent. The company was purchased as part of the acquisition of Cable & Wireless Worldwide by Vodafone Group on 27 July 2012. Demon now operates as a brand of Vodafone. From 1996 to 2006 Demon operated a subsidiary ISP business in the Netherlands. It was sold to KPN in June 2006 and its operations transferred to their XS4ALL subsidiary. The public telephone number of the company, and many of the dialup access numbers, end with 666 (the supposed Number of the Beast), a deliberate pun on the name Demon. When Thus plc was formed as a parent of Demon, its randomly allocated company number also ended in 666. Also, after a spate of \"access\" related names (e.g. gate, post) many of its original servers' hostnames started with dis, being the initial letters of Demon Internet Services as well as the name of a part of Hell in Dante's Inferno and another name for Lucifer."

The resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s. When it opened to guests on July 17, 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its 100-acre parking lot (which had 15,167 spaces), and the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather. After succeeding with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Disney acquired large parcels of land adjacent to Disneyland to apply the same business model in Anaheim. During the expansion, the property was named the Disneyland Resort to encompass the entire complex, while the original theme park was named Disneyland Park. The company purchased the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather Company and the Pan Pacific Hotel from its Japanese owners. The Pan Pacific Hotel later became Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. The property saw the addition of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, a second theme park, named Disney California Adventure, and the Downtown Disney shopping, dining, and entertainment area."

The company acquired the 280 stores of the P.N. Hirsh Division of Interco, Inc. in 1983, and in 1985 added 206 stores and a warehouse from Eagle Family Discount Stores, also from Interco, Inc. In recent years, the chain has started constructing more stand-alone stores, typically in areas not served by another general-merchandise retailer. In some cases, stores are within a few city blocks of each other. Dollar General offers both name brand and generic merchandise — including off-brand goods and closeouts of name-brand items — in the same store, often on the same shelf. Although it has the word \"dollar\" in the name, Dollar General is not a dollar store by the strict definition of that term as most of its products are priced at more than $1.00. However, goods are usually sold at set price points in the range of .50 to 60 dollars, excluding articles such as phone cards and loadable store gift cards. Outside of larger urban markets and small cities, Dollar General often serves smaller rural areas which do not have the customer base for a regular-sized discount department store, such as Beaver, Oklahoma in the Panhandle region, where the closest small city with larger stores is Liberal, Kansas an hour north. It competes in the dollar store format with national chains Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, regional chains such as Fred's in the Southeast, and numerous independently owned stores. Since 2000, Dollar General has experimented with stores that carry a greater selection of grocery items. These stores, (similar to the Walmart Supercenter, but much smaller), operate under the name \"Dollar General Market\"."

  "text" : "DHL Express is a division of the German logistics company Deutsche Post DHL providing international express mail services. Deutsche Post DHL is the world's largest logistics company operating around the world, particularly in sea and air mail. Originally founded in 1969 to deliver documents between San Francisco and Honolulu, the company expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. The company was primarily interested in offshore and inter-continental deliveries, but the success of FedEx prompted their own intra-US expansion starting in 1983. DHL expanded to countries that could not be served by any other delivery service, including Cuba, the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, Iraq, Iran, China, Vietnam and North Korea. In 1998, Deutsche Post began to acquire shares in DHL. It finally reached majority ownership in 2001, and completed the purchase in 2002. Deutsche Post then effectively absorbed DHL into its Express division, while expanding the use of the DHL brand to other Deutsche Post divisions, business units and subsidiaries. Today, DHL Express shares its DHL brand with other Deutsche Post business units, such as DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Supply Chain."

  "text" : "Double Fine Productions, Inc. (commonly referred to as just Double Fine) is an American video game developer founded in July 2000 by Tim Schafer after his departure from LucasArts. He started Double Fine with programmers David Dixon and Jonathan Menzies in what was once a clog shop in San Francisco. After several months of working on the demo for what would become Psychonauts, a mixture of personnel from the Grim Fandango development team and other new employees were slowly added to begin production. Though the company's first two games Psychonauts and Brütal Legend were critically praised, both underperformed publishers' expectations. The future of the company was assured when Schafer turned to several in-house prototypes built during a two-week period known as \"Amnesia Fortnight\" to expand as smaller titles, all of which were licensed through publishers and met with commercial success. Schafer has since repeated these Amnesia Fortnights, using fan-voting mechanics, to help select and build smaller titles. Double Fine is also credited with driving interest in crowdfunding in video games, having been able to raise more than US$3 million for the development of Broken Age, at the time one of the largest projects funded by Kickstarter. The company has continued to build on their independent developer status and has promoted efforts to help other, smaller independent developers through its clout. The name \"Double Fine\" is a play on a sign on the Golden Gate Bridge that used to display \"double fine zone\" to warn motorists that fines on that stretch of road were double normal rates. Double Fine's logo and mascot is called the Two-Headed Baby, frequently abbreviated 2HB, an abbreviation also used for their Moai IDE/debugger. The company is based in San Francisco. The official Double Fine website is also host to seven webcomics, which are created by members of Double Fine's art team and are collectively referred as the Double Fine Comics."

  "text" : "Destination Games was an American computer game development company created in April 2000 by Richard Garriott, Robert Garriott and Starr Long, following their departure from Origin Systems. (\"Destination\" is a play on \"Origin\", the company the Garriotts founded nearly two decades earlier.) Destination was founded in Austin, Texas to develop massively multiplayer online role-playing games. At E3 2001, Richard Garriott announced a partnership making Destination the United States headquarters of South Korean MMORPG giant NCSOFT. As NCSOFT Austin, Destination has mainly focused on developing and supporting the North American version of NCSOFT's Lineage games. In 2007 Destination Games released its first game, Tabula Rasa, a sci-fi MMORPG. The game did not sell as well as was hoped, Richard Garriott left NCSOFT in 2008, and the game service closed in February 2009. The Destination Games website was taken down when NCsoft moved its United States headquarters from Austin to Seattle—calling it NCSOFT West—in 2008. NCSOFT Austin employed five people to run the casual MMOG Dungeon Runners, but announced in 2009 that support for this game will be ending in early 2010 due to low subscription numbers. As of October 2009, NCSOFT employs about 150 people in the former Destination Games office in Austin mainly working in server operations, quality assurance, and customer support for various NCSOFT MMO titles, however development operations have moved completely to other NCSSOFT subsidiaries on the West Coast. The trademark Destination Games still remains a property of NCSOFT."

They presented their first women's collection in 1985 in Milan, where a year later their store would open its doors. In 1988, they launched their leotard line, and in 1989 they began designing underwear and swimming costumes. Dolce & Gabbana started to export their products to Japan and other countries like the U.S., where they founded their own showroom in 1990. In 1992, the same year they presented their men's collection, they also launched their first perfume Dolce & Gabbana. They won the Woolmark award in 1991, and the prize \"most feminine flavor of the year\" in 1993. Towards the end of the 1990s their sales were around 500 million dollars and in 2003 their revenue reached $633 million. By 2005, their turnover was €600 million."

  "text" : "Deutsche Bank AG (literally \"German Bank\"; pronounced [ˈdɔʏ̯t͡ʃə ˈbaŋk ʔaːˈgeː]) () is a German global banking and financial services company with its headquarters in the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers in Frankfurt. It has more than 100,000 employees in over 70 countries, and has a large presence in Europe, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and the emerging markets. In 2009, Deutsche Bank was the largest foreign exchange dealer in the world with a market share of 21 percent. The company was a component of the STOXX Europe 50 stock market index until being delisted on August 8, 2016. The bank offers financial products and services for corporate and institutional clients along with private and business clients. Deutsche Bank’s core business is investment banking, which represents 50% of equity, 75% of leverage assets and 50% of profits. Services include sales, trading, research and origination of debt and equity; mergers and acquisitions (M&A); risk management products, such as derivatives, corporate finance, wealth management, retail banking, fund management, and transaction banking. In January 2014 Deutsche Bank reported a €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 2013. This came after analysts had predicted a profit of nearly €600 million, according to FactSet estimates. Revenues slipped by 16% versus the prior year. On 7 June 2015, the then co-CEOs, Juergen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, both offered their resignations to the bank's supervisory board, which were accepted. Anshu Jain's resignation took effect on 30 June 2015, but he provided consultancy to the bank until January 2016. Juergen Fitschen temporarily continued as joint CEO until 19 May 2016. The appointment of John Cryan as joint CEO was announced, effective 1 July 2016; he became sole CEO at the end of Juergen Fitschen's term. In January 2016, Deutsche Bank pre-announced a 2015 loss before income taxes of approximately €6.1 billion and a net loss of approximately €6.7 billion. Following this announcement, a bank analyst at Citi declared: \"We believe a capital increase now looks inevitable and see an equity shortfall of up to €7 billion, on the basis that Deutsche may be forced to book another €3 billion to €4 billion of litigation charges in 2016.\""

Its first sports theme cards were produced in 1965, when it created a series of racing cards sponsored by Hot Rod Magazine. Its next series of sports products came in 1981, when it produced baseball and golf trading cards. It was one of three manufacturers to produce baseball cards from 1981 to 1987, along with Fleer and Topps; until Score entered the market in 1988, and Upper Deck in 1989. Since entering the trading card market, it has produced a variety of sports trading cards, including baseball, basketball, boxing, football, golf, hockey, racing and tennis; and has acquired a number of brand names. Donruss produced baseball cards from 1981 to 1998, when then parent company Pinnacle Brands filed for bankruptcy. Baseball card production resumed in 2001, when then parent company Playoff Corporation acquired the rights to produce baseball cards. From 2007 to 2009, Donruss has released baseball card products featuring players that are no longer under MLB contract after MLB decided to limit licensing options in 2005."

All films released by Dimension Films prior to October 1, 2005, remain the property of Miramax Films; half the profits of sequels made to Miramax-era films went to Disney until Miramax was sold to Filmyard Holdings, a joint venture of Colony Capital, Tutor-Saliba Corporation, and Qatar Investment Authority in 2010. The studio's movie franchises include the later Halloween films, later Hellraiser films, Children of the Corn, Scream, Spy Kids and Scary Movie. Its films are currently released on DVD and Blu-ray by Beverly Hills–based Anchor Bay Entertainment under The Weinstein Company, due to the Weinsteins' 25% purchase of Starz Media, which is Anchor Bay's parent. Before the purchase, they were distributed by Genius Products and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The pre-2005 Dimension films were originally released to home video through Buena Vista Home Entertainment while Miramax was owned by Disney. They are currently distributed on home video through Lionsgate (with the exception of the overseas rights to The Brothers Grimm, in which is now owned by Disney as of 2015), with Echo Bridge Home Entertainment briefly handling some as well. The company also produces the Scream TV series for MTV. Dimension Films also has involvement with One Ball Pictures who owns the \"Funny Or Die\" online series. They released their first episode, \"A Lesson with John McEnroe\", with Dimension Films."

  "text" : "Du Pont Motors was founded by E. Paul du Pont to produce marine engines for the Allied nations in World War I. After the war, the Du Pont Motor Company produced extremely high-end automobiles. The cars were manufactured in Wilmington, Delaware. E. Paul du Pont's resources allowed him to hire quality automotive and management talent. The company's first product, the Model A, was introduced at the 1919 International Salon at the Commodore Hotel in New York City (an event for the wealthy by invitation only, along with the finest manufacturers and coach builders). The Model G was introduced in 1928 with a 5.3 liter side-valve straight eight engine of 125 hp (93 kW). Between 1919 and 1931, Du Pont produced only some 537 automobiles, most of which no longer exist. They were compared to such luxury cars as Packard, Cadillac and even Duesenberg, and were known for their quality and style. Customers included Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Will Rogers and Jack Dempsey. The company went bankrupt in 1932 and merged into the Indian Motorcycle Company when E. Paul du Pont purchased the Indian Company."

  "text" : "De Tomaso Modena SpA was an Italian car-manufacturing company. It was founded by the Argentine-born Alejandro de Tomaso (1928–2003) in Modena in 1959. It originally produced various prototypes and racing cars, including a Formula One car for Frank Williams' team in 1970. The company went on to develop and produce both sports cars and luxury vehicles. From 1976 to 1993 De Tomaso owned legendary Italian sports car maker Maserati, and was responsible for producing cars including the Biturbo, the Kyalami, Quattroporte III, Karif, and the Chrysler TC. De Tomaso also owned motorcycle company Moto Guzzi from 1973 to 1993. De Tomaso went into liquidation in 2004, although production of new cars continued after this date. By 2008 a buyer was being sought for the De Tomaso factory and trademarks, as per the court-appointed liquidators. In 2009 Gian Mario Rossignolo bought the De Tomaso trademark and founded a new company named De Tomaso Automobili SpA. Rossignolo planned to assemble chassis and bodies in one of Delphi Automotive’s old production facilities in Livorno and to fit bodywork, paint and finish its cars in the former Pininfarina factory in Grugliasco. In May 2012, De Tomaso was again for sale after their business plan failed to gather sufficient financial backing. In July 2012, Rossignolo was arrested following allegations that he misused €7.5 million worth of government funds. In September 2012, speculation emerged that BMW might be interested in the brand factory to produce new BMW models. In 2014 the original workshop in Modena was in abandonment. In April 2015 an Italian bankruptcy court approved the sale of the company to China's Consolidated Ideal TeamVenture, for 1.05 million euros, or approximately $1.17 million USD. Per that sale report \"A lawyer for the buyer announced that Ideal TeamVenture plans to produce cars in China bearing the De Tomaso name.\""

  "text" : "Dominion Diamond Corporation formerly known as Harry Winston Diamond Corporation and before that Aber is a Toronto, Canada, specialist diamond mining and retail company. The company holds a 40% stake in the Diavik Diamond Mine Project. Production at the Diavik Diamond Mine, Canada's second diamond mine, is operated by Dominion Diamond Corporation's joint venture partner, Diavik Diamond Mines Inc., a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group. The mine began producing diamonds in November 2002. In 2012 the company purchased all of BHP Billiton's diamond assets; the primary asset is the Ekati Diamond Mine, which is adjacent to the Diavik Mine. Diavik and Ekati combined are estimated to produce over 7 million carats of diamonds in 2014, worth an estimated $1.1 billion. Diavik and Ekati are currently ranked the 9th and 19th largest diamond mines in the world, respectively, according to total carat production. The company's participation in the retail segment of the diamond pipeline was by means of its ownership of Harry Winston, Inc., a chain of retail stores. On January 14, 2013 the company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its luxury brand diamond jewelry and timepiece division, Harry Winston Inc., to The Swatch Group Ltd. for US$750 million plus their assumption of up to US$250 million of pro forma net debt. The transaction included the brand and all the activities related to jewelry and watches, including the 535 employees worldwide and the production company in Geneva (Switzerland). Aside from its corporate office in Toronto, Harry Winston also has a rough diamond sorting facility in Toronto and a marketing office in Antwerp, Belgium. Harry Winston sells Tiffany & Co. about 25% of the diamonds in Winston's share and sells the remainder on the Antwerp open diamond market through its rough diamond dealer subsidiary, Aber International."

The brothers moved their operations to Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1916 to manufacture engines for World War I. In 1919, when their government contracts were cancelled, they moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, home of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and established the Duesenberg Automobile and Motors Company, Inc. (Delaware). In late 1926, E.L. Cord added Duesenberg to his Auburn Automobile Company. With the market for expensive luxury cars severely undercut by the Depression, Duesenberg folded in 1937."

  "text" : "Dunnes Stores is a retail chain that primarily sells food, clothes and household wares. In addition to its main customer base in both parts of Ireland, the chain has operations in England, Scotland and Spain. The format of the chain's stores include a grocery supermarket operating alongside a clothing/textiles store. The grocery operation only operates in Irish stores and some Northern Irish stores, although some limited grocery ranges can be found in the Spanish stores.

Many products are sold under the St. Bernard brand later being rebranded as \"My Family Favourites\" in 2013."

In mid-1980s, it had a subsidiary in Germany, Daisy Systems GmbH and one in Israel. The company merged with Cadnetix Corporation of Boulder, Colorado in 1988, with the resulting company then known officially as Daisy/Cadnetix, Inc. with the trade name DAZIX. It filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in 1990 and was acquired by Intergraph later that year. Intergraph incorporated DAZIX into its EDA business unit, which was later spun off as an independent subsidiary named VeriBest, Inc. VeriBest was ultimately acquired by Mentor Graphics in late 1999. Daisy Systems was founded by Aryeh Finegold and David Stamm; its original investors were Fred Adler and Oak Investment Partners. Daisy along with Valid Logic Systems and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV, added front end design to the existing computer-aided design aspects of computer automation."

  "text" : "Digital Angel, Corp. (OTCQB: DIGA) is a developer and publisher of consumer applications and mobile games designed for tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices, as well as a distributor of two-way communications equipment in the U.K. The company formerly developed Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology products for consumer, commercial, and government sectors. The company manufactured tracking devices for people, animals, the food supply, government/military arena, and commercial assets. Included in this product line were RFID applications, end-to-end food safety systems, GPS/Satellite communications, and telecommunication, security infrastructure and the controversial Verichip human implant, a product which has caused concern among advocates of civil liberties. Applications for this technology include pets, wildlife and livestock identification using implantable RFID microchips, scanners and antennas. Digital Angel has also researched and developed GPS Search and Rescue Transponders that integrated geosynchronous communications for use by the military and the private sector to track aircraft, ships and other high-value assets. Digital Angel formerly owned a minority position (49%) in VeriChip, but divested itself of the stake in 2008. VeriChip Corporation and Steel Vault Corporate later merged to form PositiveID, and in 2010 PositiveID attempted a friendly acquisition of Digital Angel, but the bid was unanimously rejected by its board of directors. The animal identification products subsidiary Destron Fearing was sold to Allflex USA, in July, 2011, for $25 million."

  "text" : "Dick Smith Holdings Limited (formerly Dick Smith, Dick Smith Electronics or DSE) was, until 2016, an Australia—wide chain of retail stores that sold consumer electronics goods, hobbyist electronic components, and electronic project kits. The chain expanded successfully into New Zealand and not so successfully into several other countries. Since 2016, online retailer Kogan.com has traded under the Dick Smith brand name in an online-only format, with Australian and New Zealand websites. The company was founded in Sydney in 1968 by Dick Smith and owned by him and his wife until 1982. Woolworths Limited purchased Dick Smith Electronics in 1982, and in 2012 sold the company to Anchorage Capital Partners, who floated it on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 2013. By December 2015, the share price had fallen 80% and in January 2016, a halt in trading was requested. On 5 January 2016, Dick Smith Holdings Limited (and associated entities) was placed into administration by its creditors. On 25 February 2016, a statement released by the receivers detailed the closure of all Dick Smith stores due to failed attempts to sell the company. Approximately 2,460 staff in Australia and 430 in New Zealand were made redundant as a result of store closures. The last Dick Smith stores closed on 3 May 2016. In May 2016, online retailer Kogan.com purchased the Dick Smith brand, trademarks, intellectual property, and its online business in Australia and New Zealand, for an undisclosed sum. On 4 May 2016, Kogan.com relaunched the Dick Smith brand-name as an online-only technology retailer in Australia and New Zealand. On 25 July 2016 Dick Smith's creditors placed the remainder of the company in liquidation."

The company was founded by the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion, Georges Bouton, and Bouton's brother-in-law Charles Trépardoux. The company was formed after de Dion in 1881 saw a toy locomotive in a store window and asked the toymakers to build another. Engineers Bouton and Trépardoux had been making a starvation living on scientific toys at a shop in the Passage de Léon, close to the \"rue de la Chapelle\" in Paris. Trépardoux had long dreamed of building a steam car, but neither could afford it. De Dion, already inspired by steam (though in the form of rail locomotives) and with plenty of money, agreed, and De Dion, Bouton et Trépardoux was formed in Paris in 1883. This became the De Dion-Bouton automobile company, the world's largest automobile manufacturer for a time, becoming well known for their quality, reliability, and durability."

  "text" : "Dynegy Inc. is an electric company based in Houston, Texas, in the United States. It owns and operates a number of power stations in the U.S., all of which are natural gas-fueled or coal-fueled. The company is located at 601 Travis Street in Downtown Houston. The company was founded in 1984 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse. It was originally an energy brokerage, buying and selling natural gas supplies. It changed its name to NGC Corporation in 1995 after entering the electrical power generation business. The company adopted the name Dynegy in 1998. It attempted to buy the Enron energy trading firm in 2001, but disengaged from the proposed acquisition due to the scandal at Enron. Dynegy nearly went bankrupt in 2002, and several executives were eventually convicted of financial fraud and mismanagement. Dynegy exited the energy trading business in 2002 and the natural gas supply business in 2005, focusing its efforts on electrical generation. The company has one major subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings. It also has three operating subsidiaries: GasCo, CoalCo, and the \"stub group\" (for other miscellaneous business enterprises). Dynegy Inc. was the subject of two unsuccessful takeover efforts in 2010. Its Dynegy Holdings subsidiary went bankrupt in November 2011, and Dynegy Inc. itself filed for bankruptcy protection on July 6, 2012. Its GasCo and CoalCo subsidiaries were unaffected by the bankruptcy filing. Dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on October 2, 2012."

  "text" : "The David Suzuki Foundation is a science-based environmental organization headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with offices in Montreal and Toronto. It is a non-profit organization that is incorporated in both Canada and the United States, and is funded by close to 30,000 donors. The Foundation describes its goal as to: Work towards balancing human needs with the Earth's ability to sustain all life. Our goal is to find and communicate practical ways to achieve that balance. The mission of the foundation is to \"protect the diversity of nature and our quality of life, now and for the future\" and their vision is \"that within a generation, Canadians act on the understanding that we are all interconnected and interdependent with nature\". Its origins lie in a 1989 \"think-tank\" retreat on Pender Island, British Columbia that was organized by David Suzuki and Tara Cullis. A dozen concerned individuals were invited, and inspired by those discussions the Foundation was incorporated on September 14, 1990. It officially opened its doors on January 1, 1991. It is a federally registered Canadian charity supported entirely by Foundation grants and donations. It does not accept any government funding, except from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. It is also not a funding body for other organizations. Currently the Foundation employs roughly fifty staff members. The Foundation's CEO is Peter Robinson, formerly the head of Mountain Equipment Co-op and BC Housing."

  "text" : "Delahaye automobile was an automotive manufacturing company founded by Emile Delahaye in 1894, in Tours, France, his home town. His first cars were belt-driven, with single- or twin-cylinder engines mounted at the rear. His Type One was an instant success, and he urgently needed investment capital and a larger manufacturing facility. Both were provided by a new Delahaye owner and fellow racer, George Morane, and his brother-in-law Leon Desmarais, who partnered with Emile in the incorporation of the new automotive company, \"Societe Des Automobiles Delahaye\", in 1898. All three worked with the foundry workers to assemble the new machines, but middle-aged Emile was not in good health. In January 1901, he found himself unable to capably continue, and resigned, selling his shares to his two equal partners. Emile Delahaye died soon after, in 1905. Delahaye had hired two instrumental men, Charles Weiffenbach and Amadee Varlet in 1898, to assist the three partners. Both were graduate mechanical engineers, and they remained with Delahaye their entire working careers. Weiffenbach was appointed Manager of Operations, and, with the blessing of both George Morane and Leon Desmarais, assumed control over all of Delahaye's operations and much of its decision-making, in 1906. Amadee Varlet was the company's design-engineer, with a number of innovative inventions to his credit, generated between 1905 and 1914, which Delahaye patented. These included the twin-cam multi-valve engine, and the V6 configuration. Varlet continued in this role until he eventually took over the Drawing Office, at 76 years of age, when much younger Jean Francois was hired in 1932 as chief design-engineer. In 1932, Varlet was instructed by Weiffenbach, under direction from majority shareholder Madam Desmarais, Leon Desmarais' widow, to set up the company's Racing Department, assisted by Jean Francois. <Club Delahaye archive>. Those who knew him well at the factory affectionately referred to Charles Weiffenbach as \"Monsieur Charles\"."

  "text" : "Dayton's was an American department store chain founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1902 by George Draper Dayton. In 1969, the Detroit-based J.L. Hudson Company merged with the Dayton Company to form the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, adding 21 Michigan-based stores to the total. In 1990, the department store division of Dayton–Hudson (now Target Corporation) acquired Chicago-based Marshall Field's. Both Dayton's and Hudson's retained their individual store names until 2001, when they were united under the Marshall Field's nameplate. Prior to changing its name to Marshall Field's, Dayton's stores numbered 19, serving communities throughout the upper Midwest. Dayton's was the parent of Target, opening the first Target in 1962 as the discount store version of Dayton's. Target quickly grew to become the majority of the company's business. In 2000, Dayton–Hudson was renamed Target Corporation. In 2004, Target finally divested their department store division to focus on discount retailing. May Company purchased the stores prior to its own acquisition by Federated Department Stores, which rebranded all the Marshall Field's stores as Macy's. Many Minnesotans have resisted the double name change, and continue to refer to \"Dayton's\" when speaking of the old stores in Southdale and Rosedale Center and Downtown Minneapolis."

Having constituted itself from a renovated former Russo-Balt factory in Riga, Latvia, the company recently attained notoriety with its current model, the Prombron, partly because it was originally available in upholstered leather made from the foreskins of whale penises. The Prombron came in nine distinct models: the Iron Diamond, Iron Xtal, Monaco Red Diamond Edition, Black Dragon, Black Russian, Gold Russian, Aladeen, White Horse, and the Monako. However, since September 2014 the product line consists of PrombronBlack Shark and Prombron Black Snake. The Prombron is then available in either the Saloon (sedan) or the Pullman (wagon), which can then be customized into a standard based, short based, or long based versions. Prombrons are also available in several armoring levels, from B2 to B7, with the B7 designed to withstand attacks from rocket propelled grenades, and land mines. In terms of performance the Prombron is equipped with an AMG V8 Engine, or an AMG V12 Engine, which provides the vehicle with a healthy top speed of 250 km/h (160 mph). In 2010, Red Sea Distribution announced that the T-98 Kombat would be available in North America for a list price starting at $225,000. However, just two years later the T-98 Kombat was phased out, and the Prombron was released. The Dartz Prombron Monaco Red Diamond Edition was shown at the 2010 Top Marques in Monaco, with an expected price of €1,000,000 ($1.25 million), it would become the world's most expensive SUV ever sold. Features included white gold - ruby embedded badges as well as a gold-plated, bullet-proof windows, an exhaust system made out of tungsten, diamond - ruby encrusted gauges, a Kevlar exterior coating, and leather made out of whale penises, although the latter was dropped. The Prombron Monaco Red Diamond Edition also comes with three bottles of the world's most expensive vodka, RussoBaltique."

  "text" : "deCODE genetics, Inc. (Icelandic: Íslensk erfðagreining) is a biopharmaceutical company based in Reykjavík, Iceland. The company was founded in 1996 by Kári Stefansson to identify human genes associated with common diseases using population studies, and apply the knowledge gained to guide the development of candidate drugs. The company isolated genes believed to be involved in cardiovascular disease, cancer and schizophrenia, among other diseases (the company's research concerning the latter is said to represent the first time a gene has been identified by two independent studies to be associated with schizophrenia). deCODE's approach to identifying genes, and in particular its proposal to set up an Icelandic Health Sector Database (HSD) containing the medical records of all Icelanders, was controversial, and prompted national and international criticism for its approach to the concepts of privacy and consent. Part of this project went ahead, in the form of a genealogical database of all Icelanders called Íslendingabók. A legal judgement from the Icelandic Supreme Court in November 2003 effectively killed off the HSD project. However, the company believed it could continue to identify disease-related genes without such a database. The company was removed from the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index in November 2008In November 2009 the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in a US court, listing total assets of $69.9 million and debt of $313.9 million. According to the American law deCODE was nevertheless allowed to continue its operations. In January 2010 most of deCODE genetics Inc.’s assets were purchased by Saga Investments LLC – an investment company whose owners include Polaris Venture Partners and ARCH Venture Partners - who said they intended to continue most services including deCODE diagnostics and deCODEme™ personal genome scans and management team. In December 2012, deCODE genetics was purchased by Amgen for $415 million which in October 2013 spun off deCODE genetics' systems and database to a new company called NextCODE Health which in turn was acquired in January 2015 by the Chinese company WuXi PharmaTech for $65 million."

  "text" : "DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (DWA, formerly DreamWorks Animation L.L.C.) is an American animation studio based in Glendale, California that creates animated feature films, television programs and online virtual worlds. The studio has released a total of 32 feature films, including the franchises of Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, Monsters vs. Aliens, and The Croods. DreamWorks Animation is now a subsidiary of NBCUniversal. The studio was formed by the merger of the feature animation division of DreamWorks and Pacific Data Images (PDI). Originally formed under the banner of DreamWorks in 1997 by some of Amblin Entertainment's former animation branch Amblimation alumni, it was spun off into a separate public company in 2004. DreamWorks Animation currently maintains its Glendale campus, as well as satellite studios in India and China. On August 22, 2016, NBCUniversal acquired DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, making it a division of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. As of April 2016, its feature films have grossed $13.48 billion worldwide, with a $421.4 million average gross per film. Shrek 2 is among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, and fourteen of the films are among the 50 highest-grossing animated films, with Shrek 2 being the eighth all-time highest. Although the studio also made traditionally animated films in the past, as well as a co-production with Aardman Animations, all of their films now use computer animation. The studio has received three Academy Awards, as well as 22 Emmy and numerous Annie Awards, as well as multiple Golden Globe & BAFTA nominations. In recent years, the animation studio has acquired and created new divisions in an effort to diversify beyond the high-risk movie business. Films produced by DreamWorks Animation were formerly distributed worldwide by the live-action DreamWorks studio, then by Paramount Pictures (who acquired the live-action DreamWorks studio in February 2006, and spun it off again in 2008). In early 2013, 20th Century Fox took over a theatrical distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation films starting in March 22, 2013 with The Croods and onwards and end in late 2017."

  "text" : "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute, Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India. Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products. Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company. By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK. In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication. Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline."

Select brews (including many of the brewery's seasonal and one-off selections) can be found in 31 U.S. states, plus Washington, D.C. Dogfish Head also licenses \"Dogfish Head Alehouse\" with three locations in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Falls Church, Virginia, and Fairfax, Virginia.

In 1896 Loewe founded Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken with a munitions plant in Karlsruhe (Baden), formerly Deutsche Metallpatronenfabrik Lorenz, and the weapons plant in Berlin. Shares that Loewe had in other gun- and ammunition plants were transferred to DWM. This included Waffenfabrik Mauser, Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre (FN) in Belgium and Waffen- und Munitionsfabrik A.G. in Budapest. The DWM was orchestrated by Isidor Loewe (1848–1910), as his brother Ludwig had died in 1886. Karl Maybach (who was part of the Maybach company) was employed by the Loewe company in 1901."

  "text" : "Diamond Multimedia is an American company that specializes in many forms of multimedia technology. They have produced graphics cards, motherboards, modems, sound cards and MP3 players, however the company began with the production of the TrackStar, a PC add-on card which emulated Apple II computers. They were one of the major players in the 2D and early 3D graphics card competition throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. The company was founded by Chong Moon Lee and H. H. Huh, who acted as the technical designer. Diamond Multimedia later merged with S3, Incorporated in 1999 after a long-time cooperative business arrangement, when S3 decided to expand their business from producing graphics chipsets to manufacturing retail graphics cards. The move paralleled the 1999 3dfx purchase of STB Systems, which changed 3dfx from a graphics chipset supplier to companies including Diamond, into a vertically-integrated graphics vendor and direct competitor to S3. However, the first major product after the merger, branded as the S3 Savage 2000, was a commercial failure. Growth in the add-on sound card market, also an ongoing Diamond business, was tempered by the 2000 bankruptcy of Aureal Semiconductor and subsequent asset purchase by vertically-integrated Creative Technologies. With these market failures, the new combined Diamond/S3 company decided to change direction and leave the PC addon-board market. SONICblue was formed. Diamond Multimedia resurfaced in 2003 after the brand and assets had been purchased by Best Data. Diamond again built expansion boards. The company was the defendant in a significant copyright case for its Rio digital music player, which the Recording Industry Association of America claimed infringed copyrights; the Ninth Circuit deemed it to be a fair use, however, in RIAA v. Diamond. Diamond Multimedia is a subsidiary of Tul Corporation."

  "text" : "Delrina was a Canadian software company, which was founded in 1988 and was subsequently acquired by the American software firm Symantec in 1995. The company sold electronic form products, including PerForm and FormFlow, but was best known for its WinFax software package, which enabled computers equipped with fax modems to transmit copies of documents to standalone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers. Delrina also produced a set of screensavers, including one that resulted in a well-publicized lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement (Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina). The case set a precedent in American law whereby satiric commercial software products are not subject to the same First Amendment exemptions as parodic cartoons or literature. It also sold online communications software with its WinComm product and produced a Web browser called Cyberjack. The firm was sold to Symantec in 1995. After the company was acquired by Symantec, various divisions were sold off and several of Delrina's former executives went on to found venture capital firms."

  "text" : "Digital Pictures was an American video game developer founded in 1991 by Lode Coen, Mark Klein, Ken Melville, Anne Flaut-Reed, Kevin Welsh and Tom Zito. The company originated from an attempt to produce a game for the failed VHS-based NEMO game system. One of its first titles, Night Trap was originally produced as a title for the NEMO, before being converted for use with Sega's new Sega CD. The mature themed content of Night Trap made it the source of some controversy. Nevertheless, the title was a bestseller. Digital Pictures went on to create other full motion video-based titles primarily for Sega hardware, and are regarded as a pioneer of the interactive movie genre. However, the company declined in the mid-1990s due to waning interest in full motion video games. Its final title, Maximum Surge went unreleased and was later repurposed into a film called Game Over."

  "text" : "Dwyer Brothers Stable was an American thoroughbred horse racing operation owned by Brooklyn businessmen Phil and Mike Dwyer. The Dwyer brothers hired trainer Evert Snedecker and purchased their first Thoroughbred, Rhadamanthus, in 1874. In October of that same year they acquired Vigil from Col. David McDaniel who to that point had earned $5630. In the ensuing few months of 1876 the colt won another $20,160 and was chosen that year's retrospective American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Other trainers who worked for the Dwyers were James G. Rowe, Sr. and Frank McCabe. The Dwyers won the 1881 Kentucky Derby with future U.S. Hall of Fame colt Hindoo and finished second with Runnymede the following year. However, they had their greatest racing success in the Belmont Stakes in their hometown, winning the classic event five times. One of the few major races at tracks in the New York/New Jersey area that they never won was the Brooklyn Handicap. The brothers, either together or individually, owned a number of prominent horses, including Hindoo, Bramble, Bella B., Luke Blackburn, Bonnie Scotland, George Kinney, Miss Woodford, Barnes, Hanover, Raceland, Tremont, Ben Brush, and Cleophus. Mike Dwyer was a partner in Kingston. In 1886 they were a key part of the group of investors who formed the Brooklyn Jockey Club and built the Gravesend Race Track at Gravesend on Coney Island. The brothers racing partnership was dissolved in 1890  and Mike Dwyer went on to enjoy further success. He won the Kentucky Derby for the second time in 1896 with Ben Brush, ridden by jockey Willie Simms. The Dwyers were owners who, like many others of that era, pushed their horses hard in a manner that would be unacceptable today. The Brooklyn Derby, founded in 1887, was renamed the Dwyer Stakes in their honor in 1918."

  "text" : "Dunlop is a brand of tyres owned by various companies around the world. It is owned and operated by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In India the brand is owned by Dunlop India Ltd. whose parent company is the Ruia Group,. In Asia (Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Russia), Africa and Latin America (except Mexico) by Sumitomo Rubber Industries. In 1985, Dunlop Rubber Company was acquired by BTR plc, and Sumitomo acquired the rights to manufacture and market Dunlop branded road tyres. Sumitomo did not acquire any Dunlop company. In 1997 Sumitomo gained agreement to use the Dunlop name in its corporate name, and changed the name of its UK subsidiary to Dunlop Tyres Ltd. In 1999 Sumitomo and Goodyear began a joint venture by which Sumitomo continued to manufacture all Japanese-made tyres under the Dunlop name, while Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company bought 75% of the European and North American tyre businesses of Sumitomo. The company has extensive manufacturing operations throughout the world. With the closure of the Washington plant in 2006, Goodyear Dunlop ceased mainstream car and lorry tyre production in the UK. In 2016 it was announced that Sumitomo Rubber Industries would commence the second phase of its $131 Million (USD) investment for the upgrade and expansion of its Dunlop tire manufacturing plant at Ladysmith, in South Africa. Dunlop maintained a motorsport manufacturing operation located in a corner of the original Dunlop factory (nicknamed \"Fort Dunlop\") in Erdington, Birmingham, established in 1891 until May 2014. This factory produced specialised vintage, motorcycle and touring car tyres, and produced about 300,000 specialised racing tyres per year. On 30 May 2014, the Birmingham factory ceased tyre production, ending Dunlop tyre production in the UK. The Dunlop GP Racer D209 tyre has been chosen repeatedly as a control tyre for the R&G Racing GSX-R Trophy motorcycle race. It has also been chosen for the Henderson Harley-Davidson XR1200 Trophy and Focused Events KTM RC8 Cup race. The main Birmingham building has been redeveloped extensively as a combined residential, office and hotel complex, with a modern shopping facility (The Fort Shopping Centre), car dealerships and several logistics warehouses. It can be observed between junction 5 and 6 of the M6, on the north side of the motorway. Until May 2014 Goodyear Dunlop occupied a compact part of the site with their British main office. In the UK, the company operates as a sales organisation, importing tyres from manufacturing plants around the world, including China, Slovenia and Poland. The Goodyear Dunlop joint venture is managed from sites in Luxembourg and Brussels, which report to Goodyear in Akron, Ohio, United States. Dunlop Tyres is the sole tyre supplier to the British Touring Car Championship (since 2003), V8 Supercars Championship (since 2002), and European Le Mans Series GTE class (since 2015). It was also the sole tyre supplier for the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters from 2000-2010. Dunlop also supplies tyres to the Japanese Super GT's Nakajima Racing, classes in the FIA World Endurance Championship and the Moto2 & Moto3 classes of the MotoGP Championship."

  "text" : "Dainese (pronounced die-neh-zeh) is an Italian manufacturer of protective wear for motorcycling, mountain biking and downhill skiing. It was founded in 1972 by its current President Lino Dainese, and is owned by Investcorp of Bahrain, and manufactures in Tunisia. Lino Dainese started the company in 1972 as a young 20 year old business man by making protective motorcycle apparel. The first article of clothing was a pair of motocross pants in Molvena (Vicenza). The company acquired the Italian helmet manufacture AGV in July 2007. Dainese has also established a United States division with offices in California, which seeks to further expand their reach in the United States. Original headquarters and main research & development facility remain in Italy. Dainese has both off-the-rack and more expensive made to measure products. Many of the company's products use materials such as carbon fiber, kangaroo hide, kevlar, and titanium. Dainese uses its racing sponsorship program to research and develop new technologies. Through 2008 and 2009, Dainese introduced an airbag suit (D-Air) in MotoGP, used by riders Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo. The suit has an airbag integrated into the leather one-piece suit, which inflates when the suit's internal microprocessor detects a crash. The D-Air suit’s back-hump houses seven sensors, three accelerometers, three gyroscopes and a GPS. The deployment time is 45 thousandths of a second. As of 2015, there have been 1000 successful deployments of the D-Air system."

  "text" : "The Erste Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft (German pronunciation: [ˈʔeːɐ̯stə ˈdoːnaʊˌdampfˌʃɪf.faːɐ̯ts.ɡəˌzɛlʃaft], First Danube Steamboat Shipping Company) or DDSG was a shipping company founded in 1829 by the Austrian government for transporting passengers and cargo on the Danube. The company built its first steamship building factory the so-called \"Óbuda Shipyard\" on the Hajógyári Island in Kingdom of Hungary in 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire. In 1880, the DDSG was the world's largest river shipping company with more than 200 steamboat ships and about 1000 cargo tubs. During the Third Reich era, the DDSG was involved in transporting Austrian Jews after Kristallnacht, when the Jews were pressured to emigrate elsewhere. Beginning in 1938, the DDSG transported Jews who were on so-called \"B-immigration transports\". The DDSG was also involved in taking excessive amounts of money and property from Jews in order to transport them. The SS worked with the DDSG in making the exit permits for Jews easier to obtain, since, at this point, the Nazis apparently just wanted them to leave the country. Although the Gestapo had leverage over the DDSG, the DDSG was a group that operated on its own will, in order to profit from forced Jewish emigration. In 1991 the company was split into a passenger transportation enterprise and a cargo transport company. The company was sold to a private owner in 1993. Today the DDSG exists in the form of the two private companies DDSG-Blue Danube Schiffahrt GmbH (passenger transport) and the DDSG-Cargo GmbH. Since the German spelling reform of 1996, \"Schifffahrt\" is written with three \"f\"s; however, since the name belongs to a company that existed before the spelling reform, the old form of the name is used when referring to the company. The name of the company is well known in German-speaking countries as a starter to humorously construct even longer compound words. Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitänsmütze is such a word, which potentially might even have been used, but probably never actually was. It means a \"DDSG Captain's hat\". Another common example is Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitänskajütenschlüssel which means \"DDSG Captain's cabin key\"."

  "text" : "DiscoverX develops, commercializes and manufactures reagents and assay kits for the drug discovery market. Their focus is on lucrative protein target classes, such as G-protein-coupled receptors and kinases. The company is built around a proprietary technology called enzyme fragment complementation or EFC which forms the basis of the assays that they design and market. In EFC, two β-galactosidase fragments are employed which are themselves inactive. One fragment (EA) has an inactivating deletion while the second fragment (ED) has a complementing fragment; in solution where both EA and ED are present, certain pairs of fragments combine spontaneously to form active complexes. Some pairs of fragments interact only weakly and combine to produce enzyme activity only when forced into close proximity by virtue of their attachment to proteins which bind to each other. This property permits evaluation of intracellular protein interactions for use in high throughput screening of drug candidates for their effect on specific cellular pathways. The company offers a wide variety of cell lines that produce such fusion products."

  "text" : "Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Nestlé, is a United States-based producer of ice cream and frozen yogurt founded in 1928 as Edy's Grand Ice Cream in Oakland, California by Joseph Edy and William Dreyer. In 1947 the partnership was dissolved, and in 1953 William Dreyer Jr. took over and changed the name to Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream. In 1963, Junior sold the company to his key officers -- Al Wolff who ran the factory, Bob Boone who ran distribution, and Ken Cook, who managed sales and served as president from 1963 to 1977. Cook's vision was to provide American families with a truly premium ice cream they could enjoy at home. In 1977, with sales of $6 million and an employee base of 75 people, Cook sold the company to T. Gary Rogers and W.F. \"Rick\" Cronk for $1 million. In 1981 the company expanded and re-adopted the name Edy's Grand Ice Cream when marketing its product east of the Rocky Mountains, so as to not be confused with another company named Breyers (today owned by Unilever). Hence they market under the Dreyer's name in the Western United States, and under the Edy's name in the Eastern and Midwestern United States. In 2002, Nestle acquired Dreyer's for $3.2 billion."

It was originated from the bus body manufacturing business of Metal Sections, known as TI Metsec in the late 1970s, the present day Metsec plc. Metal Sections, as the name suggests, produced prefabricated sections of metal for customers for a variety of products. In the early days, Metal Sections was not involved in the bus body business, however, after supplying framing sections for other bus body builders, they decided to get into the business themselves. The business was acquired by Duple Coachbuilders in 1980/1981. Duple Metsec became a subsidiary of Hestair Group in 1983 and then subsidiary of Trinity Holdings in 1989. When Duple Coachbuilders was closed by Trinity Holdings in 1989, Duple Metsec was not closed and its business was retained. In October 1998, it was acquired by Mayflower Corporation. The factory of Duple Metsec was closed after the formation of TransBus International in 2001."

  "text" : "DP World (Arabic: موانئ دبي العالمية‎‎) is a leading enabler of global trade and an integral part of the supply chain. It operates multiple yet related businesses – from marine and inland terminals, maritime services, logistics and ancillary services to technology-driven trade solutions. DP World has a portfolio of 77 operating marine and inland terminals supported by over 50 related businesses in 40 countries across six continents with a significant presence in both high-growth and mature markets. Its aim is to be essential to the bright future of global trade, ensuring everything it does has a long-lasting positive impact on economies and society. DP World's dedicated team of over 37,000 employees from 110 countries cultivates long-standing relationships with governments, shipping lines, importers and exporters, communities, and many other important constituents of the global supply chain, to add value and provide quality services today and tomorrow. Container handling is the company's core business and generates more than three quarters of its revenue. In 2015, DP World handled 61.7 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) across our portfolio. With its committed pipeline of developments and expansions, the current gross capacity of 79.6 million TEU is expected to rise to more than 100 million TEU by 2020, in line with market demand. By thinking ahead, foreseeing change and innovating DP World aims to create the most productive, efficient and safe trade solutions globally. The company was founded in 2005 by merging Dubai Ports Authority and Dubai Ports International (which had been founded in 1999). It purchased P&O Group of the United Kingdom in 2006 for £3.9 billion ($7 billion), which was at the time the world's fourth largest ports operator. Shares representing 20% of the company were floated on the NASDAQ Dubai stock exchange in 2007. The company does not currently operate in the United States where its purchase of a number of U.S. ports led to high-level controversy."

  "text" : "The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is the rough diamond sales and distribution arm of the De Beers Family of Companies. The DTC sorts, values and sells approximately 75% of the world’s rough diamonds by value. The DTC has a combination of wholly owned and joint venture operations in South Africa (DTCSA), Botswana (DTCB), Namibia (NDTC) and the United Kingdom (DTC). The DTC sells diamonds that are sourced primarily from De Beers’ mining operations in South Africa and Canada, and through its partnerships with the governments of Botswana, Namibia and Tanzania. Sorters in London, Kimberley, Windhoek and Gaborone sort these diamonds into approximately 12,000 different categories based on size, shape, quality and colour. DTC clients are known as Sightholders, and the selection process is based on the outcome of the Supplier of Choice (SoC) Sightholder application and assessment process. DTC Sales in 2009 were $3.84bn. The DTC also develops and produces diamond technology, which ensures consistency of DTC rough diamond assortments for its Sightholder clients. The DTC’s Sightholders are required to comply with the De Beers’s Best Practice Principles (BPP)s which set out various objective standards of conduct within three main areas – Business responsibilities; Social responsibilities; Environmental responsibilities. The BPPs ensure that the De Beers Family of Companies, DTC Sightholders and applicable third parties are operating to the specific ethical, legal, professional, social and environmental standards. The DTC also requires its clients to be 100% committed to the Kimberley Process. The Kimberley process started when Southern African diamond-producing countries met in Kimberley, South Africa, in May 2000, to discuss ways to stop the trade of ‘conflict diamonds’ and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence or terrorism activities. In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The KPCS sets out the requirements for controlling rough diamond production and trade. The KPCS became effective in 2003."

  "text" : "Doraville Assembly was a General Motors automobile factory in Doraville, Georgia, just northeast of Atlanta. The plant opened in 1947 and was under the management of GM's newly created Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division created in 1945. It was closed on 26 September 2008 as part of the company's cost-cutting measures. According to an article that appeared in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on January 28, 2010, New Broad Street Doraville, LLC, a development company, has executed a purchase contract with General Motors to purchase the former plant, with plans to build a mixed-use, transit-oriented development. New Broad Street's deal fell through when, DeKalb County decided against using its federal stimulus and property taxes dollars to partially fund the project. Doraville Assembly was one of two General Motors factories in Atlanta, the second one was called Lakewood Assembly, in the southeast community of Lakewood Heights, built in 1927. The site is adjacent to the four-track Doraville Yard, a railyard that primarily loaded GM automobiles into auto carriers, and is still served by Norfolk Southern for other uses. MARTA's Gold (formerly Northeast) line passes nearby, providing the rapid transit for the new land development around the Doraville station. As of 2014 the entire assembly facility has been torn down to make way for a new mixed-used, transit oriented development. A corner portion (about 20 acres) was sold off to the Nalley Automotive Group and will be located next to the current Brandsmart. It's the farthest location from the Doraville MARTA station, hence the least walkable. The site was purchased by Integral Group and Macauley + Schmit. They have developed a master plan of streets, parks and such which was approved by the City of Doraville. Plans include an amazing \"covered street\" that will connect Park Avenue to the Assembly Doraville, by going UNDER the MARTA station as well as 13 Norfolk Southern railroad tracks! The former training facility on the Southern portion of the site has been converted into Third Rail Studios, a full service film and television production facility to serve the growing film and television industry in Georgia. Third Rail Studios opened in August 2016."

The company also produces miscellaneous guitar accessories, such as cables, straps and hardware. DiMarzio became known for its Super Distortion model, which was the first after-market replacement guitar pickup. It was introduced in 1972  and is still one of the most popular models. The Super Distortion pickup produced a higher electrical output than the pickups normally fitted as standard to guitars at the time. It has around twice the output of a PAF-type pickup, and stronger ceramic magnets. This drove the input stage of guitar amplifiers with roughly twice as much voltage as a PAF pickup, so that an overdriven distorted sound was easier to obtain. Two of the technologies that they are known for are: \n*  their Dual-Resonance design which uses two asymmetrical coils tuned to different frequencies to produce unique sounds. \n*  their Airbucker™ design which reduces string pull and increases sensitivity and sustain."

  "text" : "Digi-Key is the fourth largest electronic component distributor in North America and a broad-line distributor of board level components. It ranks as the fifth largest electronic component distributor in the world. Founded in 1972 by Ronald Stordahl, its name is a reference to the “Digi-Keyer Kit”, a digital electronic keyer kit that he developed and marketed to amateur radio enthusiasts. He continues to privately own the company. Mark Larson, who joined Digi-Key in 1976 as its general manager, has been its president since 1985. He has led the company from its initial focus on the hobbyist market to the expanded market it serves today. Digi-Key President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Larson announced he would be stepping down from his role within the company and transition to a board position on June 1, 2015. Dave Doherty, who serves as the Executive Vice President of Operations at Digi-Key, transitioned to Larson’s position. In 1996, Digi-Key introduced its website that offers complete online commerce capabilities along with access to product inventory. Digi-Key currently hosts 82 websites in eight supported languages. Digi-Key continued to grow following the recession in 2008. In six years, Digi-Key moved from 16th largest to fifth largest among the more than 300 electronic component distributors in North America. According to their website, in 2007 EE Times conducted a survey in which engineers rated Digi-Key “#1 for Overall Performance for the 16th Consecutive Year”. Digi-Key is located in a single, centralized location in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. Its facility measures 800,000 square feet (74,000 m2) and houses over 3,000 employees. Its product distribution center stocks over 1.2 million products from over 650 manufacturers and ships to 170 countries worldwide. The company can also provide access to more than 4.6 million products from their online catalog. On December 8, 2015, Digi-Key announced that they had shipped their 50,000,000th package and recognized this as an important company milestone. In celebration, they have been highlighting key customers from different worldwide regions by granting them with a \"Bronze Package\" award. Digi-Key serves design engineers and the prototyping market, as well as an expanding role in supplying production quantities for OEMs and contract manufacturers."

  "text" : "DataPlay is an optical disc system developed by DataPlay Inc. and released to the consumer market in 2002. Using very small (32mm diameter) disks enclosed in a protective cartridge storing 250MB per side, DataPlay was intended primarily for portable music playback, including both pre-recorded disks and user-recorded disks (and disks that combined pre-recorded information with a writable area). DataPlay included an elaborate digital rights management system designed to allow consumers to \"unlock\" extra pre-recorded content on the disk at any time following the initial purchase. The recorded music industry was generally supportive of DataPlay and a small number of a pre-recorded DataPlay disks were released, including a Britney Spears album. However, as a pre-recorded format, DataPlay was a failure. There were very few products seen on the market that could write data to these discs. Most notable was the Topy Mini Writer, which retailed for $130 (USD) and housed an optical pickup unit (image №4) with a USB interface board, allowing the use of DataPlay discs much like other end-user writable optical media (e.g., CD-Rs). Other noted products were the iriver IDP-100 and the MTV Video Device \"MTV FLIP\", which both housed the prototype-based model (image №2). As of 2012-01-14 it is extremely hard to obtain any DataPlay items, as they have not been produced in some time; they are quite rare, unless found on a surplus or auction website catering to collectors or aficionados looking to obtain them.

  "text" : "Damen was established in 1927 in the town of Hardinxveld-Giessendam in the Netherlands by Jan and Marinus Damen. The two brothers ran a successful, mainly Dutch-oriented, shipyard for decades. Over the years they managed to build up a small, but loyal customer-base. Damen Shipyards Hardinxveld, located about 10 km from Damen’s HQ in Gorinchem, still exists today and is specialised in designing and building workboats, especially Multi Cats ad Shoalbusters. In 1969 Jan Damen’s son, Kommer Damen, took over. In addition to building reliable vessels at an affordable price, Kommer Damen had a revolutionary idea: the standardisation and series production of workboats. To make this vision become reality he needed the support of several key suppliers and clients, most of which still maintain a close relationship with Damen today. Today, Damen Shipyards Group is a globally operating company with more than 50 shipyards, repair yards and related companies as well as numerous partner yards that can build Damen vessels locally.Since 1969, Damen has designed and built more than 5,000 vessels and delivers up to 150 vessels annually. Even though it is a major international group, doing business in 120 countries, it is still a family-owned company."

  "text" : "Divine was a Chicago-based company that started out as an Internet Incubator named Divine InterVentures. The company was founded by Andrew 'Flip' Filipowski in 1999. Like many other \"dot-com\" companies, Divine had many tales of excess. The board of directors once had over forty members and included luminaries such as NBA star Michael Jordan. Divine was one of the last Internet companies of this era to go public. Their much-ballyhooed IPO in July, 2000 landed with a resounding thud and never closed more than a few percent above the initial offering price. When the Internet stock bubble burst, Divine switched business models. Its management decided to become an enterprise software company offering an extensive array of products and services. Now dropping the InterVentures and calling itself just Divine, it took the most viable of its incubator businesses and purchased other companies with stock values deflated by the collapse in the stock market. Many of these businesses were unprofitable, leading to cash-flow problems. The whole premise of the original Divine interVentures was a concept known as an \"Internet Zaibatsu\". The core concept was that the normal departments of a corporation such as: HR (Talent Divine), Marketing (Buzz Divine), Web development (Xqsite), Sales (Brandango), and other operational areas would become their own companies. These companies were called the greenfield companies. These companies would then sell their services to the other greenfield companies, as well as to external companies that were funded by Divine interVentures, at a discounted rate from what they could receive if they outsourced those functions to external vendors. The whole premise was based on a Japanese business model called a keiretsu. Divine interVentures, which was the center of the circle, was the parent corporation and was essentially acting as a venture capital company funding both the greenfield companies, as well as the external companies that they invested in."

The company focused exclusively on this market for the full range of Mac computers through 1995, utilizing the Motorola 68030, 68040 and PowerPC 601 processors. These upgrades were installed directly into the PDS slot of various Macintosh platforms, as on the Macintosh IIci, or via an adapter. DayStar became known as the leading \"speed shop\" for Macintosh computer systems; it won virtually every Mac editorial award given for product excellence and had the top rated brand among peripheral manufacturers. The company also formed unique strategic relationships with many companies including Apple, IBM and Adobe. In 1995, DayStar was one of three companies in the world awarded licenses by Apple to “clone” the Macintosh computer."

  "text" : "D. R. Horton is the largest home construction company in the United States based on its 37,380 houses sold (up 26% year over year) and closed 36,648 (up 28% year over year) in fiscal year 2015. D.R. Horton posted revenues of $10.7 billion in 2015. D. R. Horton was founded in 1978 by Donald R. Horton in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The company's headquarters is located in the D. R. Horton Tower in Downtown Fort Worth. D. R. Horton operates three separately branded divisions: Emerald Homes, Express Homes, and Freedom Homes. Express Homes is tailored to entry-level buyers while the Emerald Homes brand is sold as luxury real estate. In July 2016, D.R. Horton announced the launch of their Freedom Homes division. The communities will be built as active adult housing and are set to be debuted in Florida, Texas and Arizona. D.R. Horton's geographic exposure extends from Texas to the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, West Coast and Southwest. The company has minimal exposure in the upper Midwest and Northeast. Single-family detached homes accounted for 91% of D.R. Horton's sales in 2013. The company also builds condominiums, town homes, and multi-family residences. D.R. Horton also operates a financial arm, which provides mortgage financing and ancillary services such as title agency services. The company doesn't maintain mortgage exposure on its balance sheet. It immediately sells the loans to third parties. Also, most of the company’s loans are agencies—Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac. Financial services account for about 3% of D.R. Horton’s revenues. In April 2015, D. R. Horton expanded its operations in the Pacific Northwest with a $72 million purchase of the homebuilding operations of Pacific Ridge Homes in Seattle, Washington. The acquisition included 350 lots, 90 homes in inventory and 40 homes in sales order backlog. Horton also acquired control of about 400 lots through option contracts. In May 2015, D. R.

  "text" : "DDT Pro-Wrestling (DDTプロレスリング DDT Puroresuringu) is a Japanese professional wrestling promotion founded in 1997 by Sanshiro Takagi. DDT, also written as D2T, stands for Dramatic Dream Team, which was the promotion's official name from 1997 to 2009. It became one of the top names in Japanese indy wrestling by creating a unique Sports Entertainment style with a Japanese puroresu flair to the matches. DDT started producing pay-per-view digests of its product on DirectTV during late 1999 to 2003 when they finally got an hour's timeslot on Samurai TV, Japan's premier sports channel which shows a lot of professional wrestling from both Japan and the United States. The cards' matches tend to be a mix of Japanese lucharesu, semi-worked shoot-style, hardcore brawling and comedy matches. DDT is in many ways a parody of American pro wrestling, particularly World Wrestling Entertainment, using over-the-top gimmicks (most notably Danshoku Dino) as well as unique match types including a hardcore match in a campsite (which featured use of bottle rockets as weapons), an \"Office Deathmatch\" (where the ring was set up to resemble a section of an office building, complete with cubicle walls and computers), and a \"Silence Match\" (where wrestlers were forbidden to make loud noises, resulting in slow-motion chops and punches and featuring the commentary team speaking in a faux-whisper). DDT was the parent promotion of Union Pro Wrestling, which held events approximately twice a month, and is the parent of Tokyo Joshi Pro, which was founded in June 2012. DDT celebrated its 15th anniversary on August 18, 2012, by holding its first ever event in Nippon Budokan. On August 17, 2015, it was announced that Union Pro would be folding after its 10th anniversary event on October 4, 2015. Three days after its folding, Union was replaced by a new promotion named Pro Wrestling Basara, which launched in January 2016."

  "text" : "The company's roots go back to a group of companies established by lawyer and single family home builder Bertram Wolstein, an alumnus of Cleveland–Marshall College of Law. In 1965 he switched to commercial real estate and began a partnership with Kmart, with the first one built in 1965. DDR filed its initial public offering of Common Shares on February 2, 1993. The price at that time was $22.00 per share, and the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DDR on February 2, 1993. On September 12, 2011 the company announced plans to change its name from Developers Diversified Realty Corporation to DDR Corp., adopting the NYSE ticker symbol as its name. The new name was chosen to represent a simplified strategy, portfolio and capital structure, as the words “developers” and “diversified” no longer accurately describe the company’s focus. Ground-up development of shopping centers is still a part of the company’s business, but does not warrant top billing in the company’s name. Further, the company’s focus on power centers renders the word “diversified” inaccurate. In September 2011, the company also launched a new tagline: “Think Retail. Create Value.” The new tagline was meant to emphasize the company’s objective to see the world through the eyes of its customers – retailers - and that the company’s primary reason for being is to create shareholder value. In August 2013, DDR and Blackstone Group’s joint venture acquired a portfolio of seven open-air shopping centers from Regency Centers Corporation for $332 million. In March 2014, DDR agreed to exit its Brazilian joint venture by selling its stake to the firm’s largest shareholder for $343.6 million. In October 2014, DDR closed on its third joint venture with Blackstone Group, the acquisition of 70 shopping centers totaling 15.7 million square feet for $1.93 billion. The portfolio primarily consists of prime power centers located in Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Phoenix and is occupied by retailers such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, The Fresh Market, Costco, Target, Walmart, Kohl's, PetSmart, , Bed Bath & Beyond, and the TJX Companies. In February 2014, David Oakes was appointed as DDR’s president and chief executive officer. Previously, Oakes had served as the company’s president and chief financial officer. In Q1 2016, DDR reported that due to strong demand in the retail sector, the company would sell between $600 to $800 million of its retail portfolio. The move to sell is an attempt to upgrade the overall quality of its portfolio. The company will be selling its lower class malls."

In 1874 Guglielmo’s sons, Giovanni and Battista Diatto, began building railway carriages for Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits and the Orient Express. In 1905 Guglielmo's grandsons, Vittorio and Pietro Diatto, began Diatto-Clément, a cooperative venture making motor-vehicles under license from French manufacturer Clément-Bayard owned by industrialist Adolphe Clément-Bayard. By 1909 they had full ownership of 'Autocostruzioni Diatto' and began developing their own motor-vehicles and exporting them worldwide. From 1905 the company built two and four cylinder cars based on the Clément-Bayard, a leading contemporary French manufacturer. By the 1920s, Diatto was making quality cars of its own design, including race cars with supercharged eight-cylinder engines. Diatto also supplied frames to Bugatti which used them for their own race cars. Some Diatto racers were prepared and raced by Alfieri Maserati who left Diatto in 1926 to establish the Maserati marque with his brothers. Diatto cars were known for their innovative engineering and as early as the 1920s they were equipped with four-wheel brakes and four-speed gearboxes. Diatto ceased production in 1929."

  "text" : "Directline-Holidays was a trading name of Holidayline (UK) Ltd until the brand and website was sold to Broadway Travel in September 2013. It specialises in selling cheap package holidays, flights and hotels. An independent and privately owned UK travel agent, it has been an early adopter and advocate of new media. Launched in 1993, directline holidays was among a handful of holiday companies advertising on television text services. In 2000 its first website directlineholidays.com was launched, advertising with bid-for-position search engine pioneers espotting (now miva) and goto (now Yahoo! Search Marketing). In 2001 the entirety of the company’s marketing budget was spent with online bid-for-position companies, including the newly created Google Adwords. By 2003 the company changed its website address to directline-holidays.co.uk and was already advertising with every major PPC (pay per click) network including adwords and Overture (now Yahoo! Search Marketing). directline-holidays.co.uk continued its early adoption of new media through 2006, trialing pay-per-call advertising with Google adwords and beta testing Microsoft adCenter in the UK. Although, well known in the UK online community for many years, geographic targeting has left the company virtually unknown outside of the UK."

Its roots go back to Doi Shōten (土居商店), also referred to as Doi Shōkai (土居商会). This was a Japanese retailer, distributor, or both, that started in 1949. (Doi here is a surname, shōten means \"retailer\", and shōkai means \"trading company\".) In the early fifties it was based in Osaka. Kimio Doi (土居君雄, Doi Kimio), son of the Mr. Doi of Doi Shōten, started a branch in Fukuoka at some time around 1956. In 1959 this became plain Doi (株式会社ドイ, Kabushiki Kaisha Doi). Doi provided diverse services, such as professional darkroom work. Retail stores were branded \"Camera no Doi\" (カメラのドイ, Kamera no Doi); these were known for the array of used cameras as well as competitive prices of new equipment. By the 1980s, Doi was as large a presence as Yodobashi Camera in the Nishi-Shinjuku area of west-central Tokyo. Its sales peaked in March 1989. However, it faltered in the 1990s and closed down in 2003. Doi Technical Photo seems to have survived this, even running a photography gallery in Yūrakuchō, but now (2006) appears to be defunct."

Dinners Ready was part of the food industry referred to as meal assembly, where customers can visit a local preparation kitchen and assemble meals to freeze and cook at home. The model has evolved to be predominately delivery-only, however, you can still come into the Kirkland, Washington location and assemble the meals or have the staff assemble them for pick-up. The meals serve two, four, or six people and come complete with side dishes. There are twenty meal choices, with the menu changing each month."

(The master and blank tapes passed through the same capstan, but through different tape head areas, yielding a Y-shaped tape path reflected in the slots built into the head assembly. Denki Onkyo also supplied a consumer and semi-pro line of reel to reel recorders (including 4 track multitracks) that competed with Tascam/Teac and Sony but ultimately its products were found to be less durable than the competition. In 1982, Murata Manufacturing acquired 55% shares of Denki Onkyo, and in 1999, the company has been fully merged into Murata."

It was established in 1974 as a sister company of Dynamic Productions. Dynamic Planning is credited in all of Go Nagai's animated works since 1974 as the \"planner\" and/or \"producer\". Since the '70s, Toei exported their anime collaborations with Dynamic Planning without their permission (Go Nagai was unaware of that fact) to Europe, Asia and America. Mazinger Z is extremely popular in Spain, Latin America and throughout Asia: UFO Robot Grendizer (aka Goldorak and Goldrake between 1976 and 1980 was a huge hit in Italy and France; Groizer X (aka O Pirata do Espaço ) was a '80s hit in Brasil. The popular Super Robot Wars's console game features most of Dynamic Planning's giant robot characters. In 1994 Dynamic Planning established an International Division, directed by Go Nagai's brother Kenji Nagai (永井謙次) and Federico Colpi, which soon established a network of associated companies throughout Europe and Asia called The Dynamic Group of Companies. In March 2001, the International Division was incorporated as d/world, a joint-venture between Dynamic Planning and Marubeni's subsidiary Omega Project. Following Marubeni's exit from the anime business in 2001, d/world was liquidated. The 2014 anime television series Robot Girls Z is based on Super Robots by Dynamic Planning."

  "text" : "Davis Food City was a supermarket chain headquartered Houston, Texas, United States, founded in 1965 and closed in 2007. It had locations in Houston, Bellaire, and unincorporated Harris County. In 1980 it had 0.5% of the Houston grocery market, making it the tenth largest grocer in the Houston area. In 1999 it was not among the ten largest Houston grocery chains. In 1998, Davis Food City became the first tenant and primary anchor in the newly remodeled Houston shopping center, Stella Link. Davis Food City maintained a corporate policy to be a good corporate citizen in the Houston area, frequently donating food for gift baskets, the community Thanksgiving Dinner for the poor, and responding to the needs of the refugees during Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005. In addition to providing the community with a full service retail grocery presence, Davis Food City offered payroll check cashing, cash transfer and wires, money orders, and operated with state-of-the-art check and debit clearing systems. Grocery supplies for Davis Food City were furnished through Houston-based Grocers Supply Co. Davis Food City used several slogans including \"Your Family's Food For Less,\" \"Great Prices, Great Service, Great Savings,\" and \"Davis Food City is the Place to Be.\" Davis Food City stores closed in 2007. In 2008, El Ahorro, a chain of Hispanic/Latino grocery markets, acquired some of the Davis Food City store properties. Houston-area supermarket retailer Sellers Bros. acquired the popular Stella Link shopping center site in 2008."

  "text" : "Darley Stud is located at Dalham Hall, the global breeding operation owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. It is on the outskirts of Newmarket, Suffolk, the international headquarters and historic home of thoroughbred horse racing. Darley currently stands more than 50 stallions around the world: in England at Dalham Hall Stud, in Ireland at Kildangan Stud, in the United States at Jonabell Farm, in Lexington, Kentucky, and on two stud farms in Australia: at Northwood Park, Victoria, and at Kelvinside in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Darley stallions also stand in France and Japan. Darley was founded in 1981 when Sheikh Mohammed purchased Dalham Hall Stud. Today, Darley studs are home to many of Europe's leading stallions. These include father and son super sires Dawn Approach and New Approach, and Dubawi, already sire of an impressive number of G1 winners. Other famous stallions who have stood at Dalham Hall include the great Dubai Millennium, Sheikh Mohammed’s favourite horse. Born on the stud and trained in Newmarket, he won the Dubai World Cup in 2000 and was the sensational eight-length winner of the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot in the same year. When he retired from horse racing, Dubai Millennium returned to the stud but sired just one crop of foals before dying of grass sickness. In addition to standing stallions, Darley also manages the racing interests of Sheikh Mohammed and various members of the Maktoum family, and has racehorses with a number of trainers in the UK, Ireland, France, the United States, Australia, and Japan. The best of these horses transfer to Godolphin, to race in the famous blue silks that have been carried to victory in numerous G1 races around the globe. In 2014, Darley Australia, together with rival Coolmore and a number of local viticulturists, won a battle against Anglo American Coal to stop the expansion of the company's Drayton South open cast mining operation in the Hunter Valley."

  "text" : "Delchamps was a chain of supermarkets along the central Gulf Coast of the United States, headquartered in Mobile, Alabama. The chain was founded by Alfred Frederick Delchamps in November 1921 at the corner of Lawrence and Canal streets in Mobile, which he operated along with his brother, Oliver. The chain was a fixture in the central Gulf Coast areas, with more than a hundred stores at its 1990s peak in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana. In 1927, Delchamps opened its first warehouse at the intersection of Commerce and St. Anthony Streets in order for the company to carry higher quality merchandise and a larger variety of foods. The warehouse would be moved to a larger facility at the foot of Dauphin Street four years later, and a larger, more modern warehouse was built at the intersection of Water and Adams Streets. Additional warehouse space was utilized in the Happy Hills community north of Downtown Mobile and at the Alabama State Docks. Delchamps opened its first supermarket at the intersection of St. Louis Street and Washington Avenue in 1928. This was the largest grocery store in Mobile and, moreover, the largest food store in Alabama. Three years later, in 1931, Delchamps would open its first out of state location in Pensacola, FL. A rival grocery chain, the Coleman Grocery Company, was acquired in 1937, making Delchamps the largest grocery chain in the city, with ten stores. In 1941, Delchamps opened its first store in Montgomery. In order to make future expansions possible, Delchamps incorporated in 1946. This incorporation allowed employees to own stock in the company as well. In 1985, Delchamps unveiled its 42,057-square-foot (3,907.2 m2) Super Store supermarket concept. This format featured a bakery, delicatessen and salad bar in addition to conventional grocery store amenities. The Delchamps Super Stores operated on a 24-hour basis. The first Delchamps Super Store opened at the North Gate Shopping Center, now known as Dauphin Square, on Dauphin Street in west Mobile. Over the next decade, Delchamps Super Store supermarkets would be constructed, replacing outmoded Delchamps grocery stores in markets along the Gulf Coast. In 1997, the chain was purchased by Jackson, Mississippi-based Jitney Jungle, itself a well-known brand name in its home state and neighboring Louisiana. A total of 114 Delchamps stores were purchased, with a handful being closed and another small group being re-branded as Jitney Jungle. However, the purchase and Jitney's takeover by an investment firm proved to be ill-advised, and by 1999 the combined chains went into bankruptcy. The next year some stores were sold off to competitor Winn-Dixie; most of those locations have since closed in the wake of that chain's own troubles and retrenchment toward its northern Florida base. Nineteen other locations were sold to Bruno's Supermarkets and converted to their brands. At least one location in Hoover, Alabama was later converted to Publix Super Markets."

  "text" : "DNA Oy (DNA) is a Finnish on telecommunications company. It was founded in 2000, and refounded in 2007 after a merger. DNA offers cellular phone services, ADSL, terrestrial television (DVB-T/DVB-T2), cable television (DVB-C) and regular (landline) telephone service. DNA was founded as the cell phone operator of the Finnet group of telephone cooperatives after there was a split-up in the association. The Helsinki Telephone Association (now Elisa Oyj) left Finnet and they needed to find a new owner, which they did in 2000. In 2006, there began to be new difficulties between the remaining Finnet companies. The largest members merged themselves with DNA and left the association. In 2012, DNA challenged a long-time dominated Digita Oy in the Finnish terrestrial television-network markets, and construction of its own competing digital- terrestrial television-network with DVB-T2-technology. In 2013, DNA acquired the monopoly (in the Finnish market) Pay-per-view-television provider PlusTV, from the Swedish state owned radio and television network operator Teracom AB. PlusTV offers a Pay-per-view television services, on Digita's and DNA's own digital terrestrial television networks, with DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T2/MPEG-4 technologies."

  "text" : "The Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) is a commodity exchange based in Dubai currently listing its flagship futures contract, DME Oman Crude Oil Futures Contract (OQD). Launched in 2007, the DME aims to become the crude oil pricing benchmark for the Asian market with its Oman Crude Oil contract, like the Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE) North Sea Brent is to Europe and the New York Mercantile Exchange’s (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate is to North America. The choice of the OQD contract as a benchmark was due to several important attributes of the crude oil itself and its infrastructure as opposed to the volume of export in comparison with other Middle East crudes. Firstly, the Omani crude oil is not subject to OPEC production quotas and/or cuts, nor is it subject to destination restrictions. Secondly, the geographical location of the export port Mina al Fahal (operated by Petroleum Development Oman - PDO),in Muscat into the Gulf of Oman, is past the Strait of Hormuz. Other reasons such as the increasing long-term production levels and investments, as well as the quality of the crude, helped tip the balance in favor of that crude to be used as a benchmark. The DME is located in the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), (a financial free zone in Dubai), and is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a \"No Action Letter\" in 2007, allowing US customers to trade DME contracts. The DME has received further regulatory approval in 23 jurisdictions."

  "text" : "D.C. United Holdings is the holding company that controls operating rights to D.C. United, a professional association football club that is part of Major League Soccer (MLS). The company, founded in 2007, was initially led by William H.C. Chang (chairman of Westlake International Group), Brian Davis and Christian Laettner (co-managers of Blue Devil Ventures), and Kevin Payne (president of D.C. United) who maintained his position with the new investors. At the time of formation, D.C. United Holdings was also interested in adding Discovery Communications founder John Hendricks, also the founder of the now-defunct Women's United Soccer Association, to the \"majority-minority\" group. Brian Davis and former owner Victor MacFarlane were the first African-American owners in MLS; William H.C. Chang is the first Asian-American. D.C. United Holdings bought D.C. United from Anschutz Entertainment Group for $33 million, a record fee for operational rights to an MLS club. The group is pursuing a soccer-specific stadium for D.C. United in the Washington area. On May 21, 2009, previous stakeholder Victor MacFarlane announced the sale of his share of D.C. United Holdings to majority owner William Chang, giving him a 98% stake in the organization. On October 21, 2009, Chang bought out Davis and Laettner, who held the remaining 2%, to fully control 100% of the team. In 2012, Erick Thohir and Jason Levien purchased the club and its holding company, with Chang remaining as a minority investor. Their efforts are primarily focused on getting United a new stadium and enhancing the four-time MLS champions' global profile."

In 1935 Ducati became successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city. In the late 1940s Ducati began producing engines for bicycles and later motorcycles, leading to the later split into two companies: Ducati Meccanica and Ducati Elettrotecnica. The former specializing in the manufacture of motorcycles and the latter for radios and electrical devices and components. Ducati Elettrotecnica was renamed Ducati Energia in the 1980s, and currently designs and produces a wide range of electronic components and subsystems for use in automotive, construction, security, and transmission and distribution (T&D) energy efficiency. It has a presence in many countries across Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America."

  "text" : "D-Wave Systems, Inc. is a quantum computing company, based in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. D-Wave is the first company in the world to sell quantum computers. The D-Wave One was built on early prototypes such as D-Wave's Orion Quantum Computer.The prototype was a 16-qubit quantum annealing processor, demonstrated on February 13, 2007 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. D-Wave demonstrated what they claimed to be a 28-qubit quantum annealing processor on November 12, 2007. The chip was fabricated at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Microdevices Lab in Pasadena, California. These early prototypes were built upon the research papers by Umesh Vazirani, leading researcher on quantum complexity theory, who dismissed D-Wave’s claims of speedup as a misunderstanding of his work, and suggested that “even if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it could be scaled to thousands of qubits, [it] would likely not be more powerful than a cellphone”. On May 11, 2011, D-Wave Systems announced D-Wave One, described as \"the world's first commercially available quantum computer\", operating on a 128-qubit chipset using quantum annealing (a general method for finding the global minimum of a function by a process using quantum fluctuations) to solve optimization problems. In May 2013, a collaboration between NASA, Google and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) launched a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab based on the D-Wave Two 512-qubit quantum computer that would be used for research into machine learning, among other fields of study. On August 20, 2015, D-Wave Systems announced the general availability of the D-Wave 2X system, a 1000+ qubit quantum computer. This was followed by an announcement  on September 28, 2015 that it had been installed at the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab at NASA Ames Research Center."

  "text" : "DirecTV (stylized as DIRECTV) is an American direct broadcast satellite service provider and broadcaster based in El Segundo, California. As of July 2015, it is a subsidiary of AT&T. Its satellite service, launched on June 17, 1994, transmits digital satellite television and audio to households in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Its primary competitors are Dish Network and cable television providers. After receiving approval from the United States Federal Communications Commission and United States Department of Justice, AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV in a transaction valued at $48.5 billion was completed on July 24, 2015. DirecTV provides television and audio services to subscribers through satellite transmissions. Services include the equivalent of many local television stations, broadcast television networks, subscription television services, satellite radio services, and private video services. Subscribers have access to hundreds of channels, so its competitors are cable television service and other satellite-based services. Most subscribers use reception antennas which are much smaller than the first generation antennas, which were typically a few yards (meters) across. Advances in antenna technology, including fractal antennas, have allowed a general reduction in antenna size across all industries and applications. Receiving equipment includes a satellite dish, an integrated receiver/decoder and a DirecTV access card, which is necessary to operate the receiver/decoder. Consumers who purchase DirecTV subscribe to various packages of DirecTV programming for which the subscriber pays a monthly fee. Additional monthly fees may include a protection plan (which provides for repair or replacement of consumer-leased equipment from damages caused by lightning, power surges, floods, etc.), DVR, additional receivers, HD channels, and other premium channel packages. A subscriber also can order pay-per-view and video on demand events and movies. DirecTV contracts with and pays program providers such as cable networks, motion picture distributors, sports leagues, event promoters, and other programming rights holders, for the right to distribute their programming to its subscribers. All programming distributed by DirecTV is delivered to its broadcast centers in Castle Rock, Colorado, and Los Angeles, where it is then digitized and compressed. The resulting signal is encrypted by DirecTV to prevent its unauthorized reception. DirecTV then transmits these signals to several satellites located in geostationary orbit. As of the quarter (Q3) ended September 30, 2012, DirecTV U.S. had 19.981 million subscribers and revenues for the quarter of US$5.769 billion. For the same period, DirecTV Latin America ended with 9.666 million subscribers and revenues of US$1.577 billion. In addition to serving residences, DirecTV offers service to bars, restaurants, hotels, dorms, and hospitals through their DirecTV for business service. The company also offered mobile service for cars, boats, and RVs (DirecTV Mobile) as well as aircraft (DirecTV Airborne) in cooperation with Connexion by Boeing."

  "text" : "DSV A/S is a Danish transport and logistics company offering transport services worldwide by road, air, sea and train. Since its foundation in 1976 by nine independent Danish hauliers, the company has achieved rapid expansion and international presence, predominantly through a series of strategic competitor acquisitions, the most important ones being Samson Transport (1997), DFDS Dan Transport Group (2000), J.H.Bachmann (2004), Frans Maas (2006), ABX Logistics (2008). In October 2015 DSV signed an agreement to acquire UTi Worldwide, Inc. (2015). The deal was closed in January 2016. With headquarters in Hedehusene (near Copenhagen), Denmark, and offices in more than 80 countries, DSV employs more than 40,000 people and collaborates with partners and agents worldwide. DSV is listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen (Copenhagen Stock Exchange) and included in the OMXC20 index as one of the 20 most traded stocks. The company is structured in three divisions, DSV Road, DSV Air & Sea and DSV Solutions. Its main activities lie within the European road transport (trucking) network, and its air and sea freight forwarding business. The group also has a growing contract logistics business. As part of an asset-light financial strategy to maintain fixed costs at a minimum and be able to quickly respond to market fluctuations, DSV does not own any ships or aeroplanes and only a relatively small number of trucks and trailers. Jens Bjørn Andersen became CEO in August 2008. In 2015 DSV reported a net revenue of Euro 6,800 million."

  "text" : "The D. L. Clark Company was founded in 1886 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now part of Pittsburgh, by David L. Clark (1864–1939), an Irish-born candy salesman. In 1921, Clark Brothers Chewing Gum Company was spun off as a separate corporation (and later sold to Philip Morris). The D. L. Clark company was family-owned until sold in 1955 to Beatrice Foods, who sold it in 1983 to the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company. The Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company entered bankruptcy in 1995, and many assets from the D. L. Clark Company, such as the rights to the Clark bar and Zagnut bar, were sold. Other candy names include Honest Square, Black Jack/Wild Cherry/Banana Caramel, Peanut Butter Log, Coconut, Light (Coconut Frosted Peanut Butter Crunch), Teaberry/Tendermint/Winter Green/Fruit Punch/Cinnamon/Peppermint/Sweetwood Gum, Boomer, Zig Zag, and Alligator Eggs. With some of the remaining assets, Clark Bar America, Inc., was created; this was acquired by Necco (New England Confectionery Company) in 1999 for $4.1 million ($6 million today)."

  "text" : "Dektor Counterintelligence and Security Inc. (Dektor CI/S) was a company started by Allan D. Bell Jr, President, Charles McQuiston, Vice President, Wilson Henry Ford, Vice President of Research and Development, in Springfield, Virginia around 1969-70. These three were responsible for inventing the Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE) a voice stress analyzer which is often called a voice lie detector; however, it is actually a truth verification device. It is based on the muscle microtremors which occur in the vocal cords when the speaker is under stress. These microtremors cannot be heard, yet they can occur either from external stressors (such as having a hot cup of coffee dumped on your lap) or from the internal stressor of lying when you know better. Michael Kradz, retired police officer was the lead instructor for the PSE class in Springfield Virginia. The PSE was featured in the old Mission Impossible show, and in the Billy Jack Goes to Trial Movie. Allan Bell Jr. was featured in a Playboy article by Craig Vetter, now journalism instructor at Northwestern University in Illinois. The PSE as well as Allan Bell Jr. was also featured in George O'Toole's The Assassination Tapes which was about whether Lee Harvey Oswald actually killed President John F. Kennedy. George O'Toole brought PSE tapes (which were similar to EKG readouts) of an \"anonymous\" person saying, \"I didn't shoot anybody, no sir\" after being asked if he shot the President (JFK). The PSE tests done on Oswald's denial indicate he was telling the truth. O'Toole, George. The Assassination Tapes. Allan Bell Jr. was born in Halifax Virginia in 1927. He was a retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, and specialized in Counterintelligence with the Counterintelligence Division (CiD). He was head of the Counterintelligence Division in Berlin and Stuttgart, Germany in the early 1960s. He received his training in counterintelligence at Fort Hollabird in Dundalk, MD in the late 1950s, and returned to Fort Hollabird as an instructor in 1967."

  "text" : "Dagoba or Loving Earth Organic Chocolate reduced from Knoppers German chocolate wafer snacks, is a brand of premium organic chocolate, founded in 2001 by Frederick Schilling. It has been owned by The Hershey Company since 2006. Its founders are no longer involved but Hershey has maintained the brand's factory in Ashland, Oregon. The name Dagoba is a Sinhalese corruption of dhatu-garbha, Sanskrit words for \"relic-chamber,\" i.e.stupa. The brand was founded with a commitment to socially responsible business. Like coffee, the production of chocolate retains vestiges of colonial relationships, so issues of social equity and \"fair trade\" arise. In 2003  CNN/Money called them one of the world's best chocolates."

  "text" : "Dimensional Fund Advisors (abbreviated as Dimensional) is an investment firm headquartered in Austin, Texas, United States, and has affiliates with offices in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, and Japan. The company was founded in 1981 by David G. Booth and Rex Sinquefield, both graduates of the University of Chicago's School of Business (now known as the Booth School of Business). The company offers over 100 equity and fixed income mutual funds. Dimensional has $414.0 billion in assets under management as of April 29, 2016. Institutional investors can access Dimensional funds directly or through their consultant. Individual investors can access Dimensional funds through financial professionals, or through their retirement plans (both 401k and defined benefit), or certain 529 college savings plans. The company is owned by its employees, board members and outside investors, which as of 2005 was reported to include Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. On November 6, 2008, the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business announced a $300 million gift from David Booth in the form of cash and the income stream from Dimensional stock. The school was renamed the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. On December 2, 2009, Dimensional announced the acquisition of SmartNest, a retirement planning computer software company. The technology offered by SmartNest was developed by Robert C. Merton, who left the company's board after the purchase to become Resident Scientist. The firm sells through financial advisors, as their products are unavailable to the general consumer who may now be aware of the company's principals. Among those who are trained to advise clients, and provide the products are Capital Asset Management in London (www.capital.co.uk), MZ Capital in Washington, DC, CJM Fiscal in New York and Integrity Investment Advisors in Colorado, as well as others."

  "text" : "Damiani was founded in 1924 by Enrico Grassi Damiani, in Valenza, Italy. It became popular among affluent Italians. Damiani's son led the company from 1960-1990. It started selling products in the US market in 2001 and introduced a $2.5 million ad campaign the following year. Damiani experienced negative press after Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston filed a lawsuit. They said Damiani was selling reproductions of the ring custom-designed by Brad Pitt and made exclusively for their wedding in violation of their agreement with Damiani. Damiani said they never made that agreement and that the rings were merely chosen from a collection of wedding rings. A settlement was reached for $50 million in January 2002. As part of the settlement, Mr Pitt designed a ring for Damiani, which Aniston would model in its advertisements for it. The Sunday Mail said the settlement was \"bizarre\". It was one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry. By 2003 it had 25 stores which each sold a single brand of products, in Italy, Asia and the US. In 2007, Damiani announced an initial public offering, which valued the company at €150.8 million (USD$215.4 million) (in 2007 exchange rates). Rocca S.p.A., an Italian jewelry and watch retailer, was purchased by Damiani for €7 million (US$9.81 million) in 2008 In 2010, Damiani had a net loss of €18.2 million (USD$25.6 million). The company's estimated total sales (in 2010/2011) were €150 million. In 2010, Birks & Mayors agreed to distribute all Damiani Group's brands, for five years, in the United States. In 2012, Damiani entered into a partnership with MingFung/Hengdeli Group to distribute its watches and jewelry in China. Also, in 2012, Damiani received permission by the Government of India to invest in the Indian jewelry market. As of November 2012, Damiani had annual revenue of €151.6 million (USD$193.3 million). In fiscal year ending March 2013, Damiani S.P.A. had sales of €137.82 million (USD$185.75 million) Currently, Damiani is run by the third generation of the Damiani family, that has been on the board of directors since 1996. In 2012, the company became the first jeweler to obtain the authorization to hold a 51% controlling interest in an Indian-based entity, Damiani India. In November 2013, Damiani raised funds for the Italian Red Cross to support people affected by the storms in Sardinia by donating 20 percent of certain sales in Damiani’s flagship stores in Italy and watch retailer Rocca. The President Guido Damiani received the America Award of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2013."

  "text" : "Dee's Drive-In was a fast food hamburger drive-in restaurant chain based in Utah. The chain was founded by Dee Frederick Anderson, who got his start selling hamburgers operating the Ute Hamburger Shop near the University of Utah in the 1920s. Anderson opened the first Dee's Restaurant in 1932. Dee's would evolve into two separate but related restaurant chains: Dee's Family Restaurant and Dee's Drive-In. Noted for its family-friendly advertising and the colorful \"Dee's Clowns\" that adorned its restaurants, the franchise became a Utah cultural landmark in the 1960s. At its height, the family operated 53 restaurants with an annual revenue of $20 million per year. In the late 1970s, an altered business strategy led the Anderson family to sell all of its Dee's Drive-Ins to Hardee's; a dozen Dee's Family Restaurants remained in business. Half of them continue to operate across the Wasatch Front region of Utah."

  "text" : "Dibella's Old Fashioned Submarines shop is a restaurant chain based in Rochester, New York, United States. They have locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Connecticut, Michigan, and Indiana. DiBella's was founded in 1918. It first began as a family owned and operated delicatessen in the city of Rochester. Over the years, their prepared foods became more prominent at the expense of their grocery items. As recently as 1998, the company's operations consisted of a single sub shop in the Rochester suburb of Henrietta (pictured); that year, a second store was added in Greece. From there, DiBella's opened additional locations around the Rochester area, then expanded into nearby Buffalo. In the late 2000s, they started expanding out-of-state, first to the Pittsburgh area, then to parts of Ohio and eastern Michigan. Locations have also opened in Albany, and the company is expanding into Connecticut and Indiana. Wegmans has incorporated DiBella's style sub shops into their stores, with consultation from the DiBella family, but they are not actual DiBella's restaurants. Top New York food critic Derek Ellis has suggested the Wegmans sub may have even surpassed the original DiBella's sub, though this claim was met with criticism from New York Times food critic Matthew Krush. The restaurants are based on a 1930s/1940s theme. They have been voted \"Best Sub in Rochester\" for 8 years in a row by the readers of the Democrat & Chronicle and City Newspaper, two local papers. They claim that what makes DiBella's unique is that all ingredients are made fresh daily, and their bread making is based on old world techniques. On April 18, 2012, Dibella's expanded their coverage to New England, opening their first New England store in Milford, Connecticut."

  "text" : "Deeds and Kettering had previously worked together in several ventures. Deeds' DELCO produced automobile self-starters developed by Kettering. The two used DELCO's profits to form the Dayton Metal Products Company. Then they formed the Dayton Airplane Company in 1917, which was soon reorganized as the Dayton-Wright Company. When the war began, Deeds was commissioned and put in charge of procurement for the Aircraft Production Board. He divested himself of his financial interest in Dayton-Wright but awarded the company two contracts to produce more than 4,000 DH-4 and Standard SJ-1 aircraft. Given the company's inexperience, the size of its contract led to charges of favoritism. A United States Senate committee corroborated these allegations, and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson appointed a commission headed by future Supreme Court of the United States Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes to investigate. Although mismanagement and favoritism were documented, charges were not brought, and the company survived the scandal. It went on to produce the XPS-1, the first airplane held by the U.S. Army with retractable landing gear. In 1919, Dayton-Wright built a limousine version of the DH-4, the single-seat Messenger, and a three-seater. In 1920, Milton C. Baumann designed the RB racer, with solid balsa wood wing, enclosed cockpit, and retractable landing gear linked to rod-operated leading and trailing-edge camber-changing flaps. In 1923 the Dayton-Wright Company had just started producing side-by-side TW-3 aircraft, powered with World War I surplus Wright E engines (American-built 180 hp Hispano-Suiza) when it was closed down by the parent company General Motors, which had purchased it in 1919. Its design rights, chief designer (Colonel Virginius E. Clark), and the TW-3 contract, were acquired by the newly formed Consolidated Aircraft Corporation of Buffalo, New York in 1923. Subsequent TW-3 aircraft were delivered as Consolidated TW-3s."

  "text" : "In 1999, the government of Abu Dhabi established Dolphin Energy Limited to implement the Dolphin Gas Project and link Qatar, the UAE and Oman in a unique, strategic energy initiative. After several years planning, drilling, construction and engineering gas production started in July 2007 at the company’s onshore facilities in Ras Laffan, Qatar. Here, gas taken offshore, from the North Field, is processed before export via subsea pipeline to the UAE.In February 2008, the Project reached full throughput of 2 billion standard cubic feet per day, helping meet 30% of the UAE’s energy requirements. Supplies of natural gas to Oman started in October of the same year. The overall investment in wells, sea lines, processing plant, export pipeline, receiving facilities and distribution network has made the Dolphin Gas Project one of the largest energy-related ventures ever undertaken in the Middle East. Dolphin Energy’s overall objective is to create long-term economic wealth and new business opportunities for GCC citizens far into the future. By providing 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent every single the day the Project is supporting industrial growth, economic diversification and the transition to a low carbon future. The long term customers for Dolphin Energy’s gas from Qatar are ADWEC (Abu Dhabi Water & Electricity Company), DUSUP (Dubai Supply Authority) and OOC (Oman Oil Company). Each has signed a gas supply agreement with Dolphin Energy for 25 years. In addition, some additional volumes of gas are made available on an interruptible basis and supplied to SEWA (Sharjah Electricity & Water Authority), FEWA (the Federal Electricity & Water Authority) and RAKGAS (Ras Al Khaimah Natural Gas Commission). Since operations began in 2007, the company has produced more than 6 trillion standard cubic feet of natural gas and recorded 100% plant availability for the seventh consecutive year. The Project is a well established, reliable and safe provider of clean energy for the southern Gulf. Dolphin Energy Limited is owned 51 percent by Mubadala Development Company, on behalf of the Government of Abu Dhabi – and 24.5 percent each by Total of France and Occidental Petroleum of the USA."

Bob and Betty Campbell started Dakota Style on their family farm in 1985, as a way to add value to their potato crop by processing it into potato chips. The \"Industrial Strength\" kettle cooked chips were the product of Betty Campbell's kitchen experiments, based on textures and tastes that were variants of Hawaiian \"Maui Chips.\" The Campbells and their sons grew Dakota Style into a successful business before selling it in 1998. In 2006, Dakota Style focused on expanding distribution of sunflower seeds, and by 2012, seeds accounted for 70 percent of distribution. Dakota Style is a sponsor of Jared Allen's Pro Bull Team. On 21 February 2016, the Dakota Style potato chip production facility was destroyed by fire. In May 2016, Dakota Style recalled 6,930 cases of sunflower seeds packaged between February and April of 2016, sourced from SunOpta, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Later that month, the recall was extended to include 15,158 cases, packaged from February through May of 2016."

The company is headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, and its common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \"DXLG.\" It operates six chains under the trade names Destination XL, Rochester Big & Tall, Casual Male XL, BT Factory Direct, Shoes XL, and Living XL. The first three businesses do business both in stores and online, with Destination XL being the largest of the stores. The other three stores strictly conduct business online. All six stores once had their own websites, but recently Destination XL decided to consolidate the sites into Destination XL's website – therefore, all six online stores are subsections of destinationxl.com. DXLG is currently in the process of transitioning from Casual Male XL to focus primarily on the Destination XL concept. The Company expects to complete the process by the end of 2015, when it expects to have over 225 stores nationwide. DXLG also has deals with Sears Canada to provide the Sears Big & Tall clothing lines. It is the largest retailer of such clothing, with about 500 locations in the United States, England and Canada. National brands carried by the chain include Cubavera, Nautica Jeans, Geoffrey Beene, Calvin Klein, and Reebok. Its in-house brands include Harbor Bay, Oak Hill, Synrgy, True Nation, and CM Gold Series. In addition, the Destination XL and Rochester stores carry such brands as Polo Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers, Robert Graham, True Religion, Peter Millar, Cutter & Buck, Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste and Paul & Shark, and their in-house brands Rochester and Society of One."

  "text" : "Dharmacon was founded in 1995 by Stephen Scaringe as Dharmacon Research to develop and commercialize a new technology for RNA oligonucleotide synthesis. The original Dharmacon focus and vision was to develop 2'-ACE RNA technology as the standard for RNA synthesis and to advance RNA oligo-dependent applications and technologies. When RNA interference (RNAi) emerged in the late 1990s, Dharmacon was poised to provide RNAi-related products to the multitude of academic and industry researchers. Dharmacon has become an important resource for those investigating the mechanisms of siRNA (small interfering RNA)-induced gene knockdown and applying the specificity and potency of RNAi to human biotherapeutics. Dharmacon's expertise in bioinformatics, RNA biology, and synthesis chemistry has allowed it to develop a complete line of products for the RNAi researcher. In November 2002, Dharmacon Research, Inc. officially changed its name to Dharmacon, Inc., to reflect the increasing capabilities and future growth potential of the company, as it had advanced beyond research and development and into whole solutions for RNA oligo-dependent applications and technologies. In March 2004, Dharmacon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fisher Scientific International, Inc. In November 2006, Fisher Scientific International, Inc. merged with Thermo Electron Corporation to become Thermo Fisher Scientific. In October 2012 the websites for the companies formerly known as Dharmacon, Open Biosystems, Fermentas, Finnzymes, and ABgene were merged, creating the new Thermo Scientific Life Sciences Research eCommerce site. In April 2013, Thermo Fisher Scientific reached an agreement to buy Life Technologies Corporation. The acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation received conditional approval from the European Commission in November 2013. The conditional requirement was the divestment of Thermo Fisher Scientific's cell culture (sera and media), magnetic beads and Dharmacon gene modulation businesses for antitrust reasons. In early January 2014, GE Healthcare reached an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to acquire the cell culture, magnetic bead and Dharmacon gene modulation businesses for 1.05 billion USD. The acquisition of Dharmacon is viewed as complementary to GE Healthcare's drug discovery research technologies. In the fall of 2014, GE Healthcare announced it had reached a licensing agreement with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard granting access to CRISPR-Cas9 intellectual property. Under the agreement, GE Healthcare is able to incorporate the patented technologies, and develop and launch additional complementary gene editing reagents. Then, in October 2014, GE Healthcare Dharmacon launched its first CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering products under the “Edit-R” brand. In July 2015, GE Healthcare Dharmacon launched synthetic crRNA and lentiviral sgRNA pre-designed with a functionally validated algorithm against entire human, mouse and rat genomes."

  "text" : "David Clark Company, Inc. is an American manufacturer, best known for noise attenuating headsets with boom microphones. Located in Worcester, Massachusetts, the company was founded in 1935 by David M. Clark. It started in the textile business with the development of unique knitted materials for specialty undergarments and over time evolved to making aerospace and communications related products. David Clark Company (DCC) is housed in a four-story building containing approximately 215,000 square feet (20,000 m2) of working area. DCC designs and manufactures a wide variety of aerospace and industrial protective equipment, including pressure-space suit systems, anti-G suits, noise attenuating communication headset systems and several medical/safety products. DCC has been involved in the design and manufacture of air-space crew protective equipment since 1941, beginning with the design and development of the first standard anti-G suits and valves used by allied fighter pilots during World War II. DCC has designed and manufactured pressure/space suits. It developed partial pressure suits for NASA's Bell X-1 rocket-powered research aircraft in the 1940s, and full pressure suits for the D558-2 and North American X-15 research aircraft in the 1950s. DCC's X-15 suit design became the basis for all of its subsequent full pressure suits, including the space suits worn by astronauts for the first U.S. extravehicular activities (EVA) conducted during NASA's Project Gemini. Since 1946, DCC's continuous pressure suit research and development efforts, sponsored largely by the Department of Defense to support its USAF high altitude aircraft (Lockheed U-2 and SR-71) programs, resulted in the late 1980s development of a new generation pressure suit. The result was the S1034 Pilot's Protective Assembly (PPA). The S1034 PPA has since become the USAF and DoD standard pressure suit and served as the basis for NASA's S1035 Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES). This was adopted for the Space Shuttle program, replacing DCC's (partial pressure) S1032 Launch Entry Suit (LES). Both the S1034 PPA and S1035 ACES continue to be used by the USAF and NASA. Throughout the 1990s, DCC conducted Engineering Design and Development activities for the USAF Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) program. This included the design and analysis of advanced ATAGS/Combat Edge vest designs for F-22 Raptor. DCC designed and developed the Tactical Flyer's Ensemble (United States Patent 7,076,808). Research has also been conducted to develop the next generation of advanced pressure/space suit systems which will be required to satisfy emerging manned space exploration requirements. This included the development of the S1035-X (\"D-suit\") in the late 1990s and the follow-on Enhanced Mobility ACES circa 2005. In 2008 DCC, along with its subsidiary, Air-Lock, Inc. of Milford, Connecticut, partnered with Houston, Texas-based Oceaneering Space Systems to develop the Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) for use on the then-upcoming Constellation program. In 2010 they designed, developed and fabricated pressure suits utilized on the Red Bull Stratos project, with which Felix Baumgartner performed a record-breaking free fall from a high-altitude balloon on 14 October 2012."

  "text" : "Dunlop Sport (Australia) produced sports goods including shoes, apparel, equipment and accessories such as the iconic Dunlop Volley sandshoes, Dunlop KT-26 running shoes, tennis racquets and balls, squash equipment and golf clubs and balls. It was a division of Dunlop Australia which became Pacific Dunlop in 1986 and became a division of the Pacific Brands company when it was spun-off as a separate company in 2001. Dunlop Australia first manufactured sandshoes in 1924.In 1939 the company introduced the Dunlop Volley shoes which are still manufactured. Dunlop Australia acquired many other shoe businesses, including some in the US. As a result, the company introduced the Dunlop KT-26 running shoe, which originated as the Osaga KT-26 in the US and is now sold mainly in Australia and Papua New Guinea. From 1899, the Dunlop Australia company and Dunlop brands in Australia and New Zealand were not connected to the Dunlop brands in the rest of the world. In November 2014, Pacific Brands sold its Dunlop Sport (Australia) Dunlop and Slazenger brands to International Brand Management & Licensing (IBML), a division of Sports Direct International plc. based in the United Kingdom, which already owned the Dunlop and Slazenger brands in every other market except Australia and New Zealand. Pacific Brands moved its Volley and other shoe brands to its subsidiary, Brand Collective Pty Ltd, which was sold to private equity firm Anchorage Capital Partners in November 2014."

  "text" : "Dunlop Rubber was a British multinational involved in the manufacture of various rubber goods. Its business was founded in 1889 in conjunction with Harvey du Cros by John Boyd Dunlop who had developed the pneumatic tyre. It was one of the first multinationals, and under du Cros and, after him, under Eric Geddes grew to be one of the largest British industrial companies. The Dunlop name was not used for any part of the business until after J B Dunlop's retirement in 1895. Dunlop Rubber failed to adapt to evolving market conditions in the 1970s despite having recognised by the mid 1960s the potential drop in demand as the new much more durable tyres swept throughout the market. After taking on excessive debt Dunlop was acquired by the industrial conglomerate BTR in 1985. Since then, ownership of the Dunlop trade-names has been fragmented."

  "text" : "Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd (DSME) (Korean: 대우조선해양) is the fourth largest shipbuilder in the world and one of the \"Big Three\" shipbuilders of South Korea (including Hyundai and Samsung). On 21 February 2011, the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group (Maersk) ordered 10 large container ships from DSME, each with a capacity of 18,000 containers, surpassing the current record holder; the Mærsk E-class at 15,200 containers. The contract is worth $1.9bn. The first is to be delivered in 2014. In June 2011, Maersk ordered ten more, for another $1.9bn. The new class is called the Triple E class. On December 20, 2011 Daewoo Shipbuilding Marine Engineering won the largest single defense contract by a Korean firm; valued at $1.07 billion to build three Indonesian submarines. It also would mark the first exports of submarines from South Korea. On 22 February 2012, a £452 million order was placed with DSME for four 37,000 tonne double hulled 'MARS' fast fleet tankers by Britain's Ministry of Defence for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The ships will enter service in 2016. The South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection found 1.5 trillion won (approximately US$1.27 billion) of accounting fraud in DSME's books on 15 June 2016."

  "text" : "The Dolmen Press was founded by Liam and Josephine Miller in 1951. The Dolmen Press was a beacon in a dark time for Irish publishing and occupies a central position in the story of Irish poetry after W. B. Yeats. Liam had returned to Dublin after working as an architect for two years in London. He acquired an Adana Hand Press and with no previous experience to guide him printed 500 copies of ‘Travelling Tinkers’ a collection of four ballads by Sigerson Clifford and it was from this that the Dolmen Press was born. The Press operated in Dublin from 1951 until Liam Miller's death in 1987. The division took printing jobs from publishers as well as theatres, art galleries, businesses and individuals. Founded to provide a publishing outlet for Irish poetry, the Press also heavily featured the work of Irish artists. The scope of the press grew to include prose literature by Irish authors as well as a broad range of critical works about Irish literature and theatre. The life and works of W.B. Yeats is a recurring theme in a variety of works, including the Yeats Centenary Series. One highlight in the Press' history was the publication of The Táin in 1969. Thomas Kinsella's translation of the Irish epic poem took 15 years from concept to publication and represented a milestone in Irish publishing. By the 1980s the Press had created the Brogeen Books division for juvenile works, and many of the later publications were under this imprint. In 2001, a collection of essays, The Dolmen Press: a Celebration, was published by Lilliput Press."

The company specialised in good quality sidecars from 1926 and a Dunelt motorcycle was first to cross the desert from Cairo to Siwa and back in 1924. Dunelt also enjoyed racing success and won the Double Twelve Hour World Record at Brooklands with a Model K in 1928. Dunelt moved into commercial three-wheeled cars but these were not a success. A Dunelt moped was exhibited at the Earls Court show in 1956 but the company diversified into other areas of engineering in 1957."

  "text" : "DineEquity, Inc. (NYSE: DIN), formerly known as IHOP Corporation, is an American company that both franchises and operates IHOP (International House of Pancakes) and Applebee's restaurants. The company is headquartered in Glendale, California, and was founded in 1976 as IHOP until after it acquired Applebee's when it changed its corporate identity. International, Inc announced on July 16, 2007 that it intended to acquire the bar-and-grill chain Applebee's International, Inc. in an all-cash transaction that was valued at approximately US$2.1 billion. Under the deal, IHOP paid would pay $25.50 per share for Applebee's. IHOP stated it would franchise most of Applebee's 500 company-owned stores. In 2015, Applebee's had 2,033 restaurants overall worldwide, all operated by franchisees. Julia Stewart, who originally worked as a waitress at IHOP and worked her way up through the restaurant industry, became Chief Executive Officer of IHOP Corporation. She had previously been President of Applebee’s, but left after being overlooked for that company's CEO position. She became CEO of IHOP in 2001, and returned to manage her old company due to the acquisition. With a larger than 70% vote, Applebee's stockholders approved the takeover, which closed on November 29, 2007. The deal beat 26 other offers to purchase the economically slumping Applebee's. A number of executives from Applebee's voted against the offer. The chain's largest individual shareholder, Applebee's director Burton \"Skip\" Sack, believed the purchasing price was unfair to the shareholders and planned to take IHOP to court. As part of the purchase, a brand re-marketing scheme and revitalization of the Applebee's image was undertaken."

  "text" : "Denofa AS, established in 1912 as De Nordiske Fabriker A/S (De-No-Fa for short), is a Norwegian industrial company. It has produced oil, proteins and fatty acid (lecithin) for the food processing industry, the fodder industry and the pharmaceutical industry. Starting with whale oil as a basis for refinement, the use of soy later became more widespread. The company was established on 10 May 1912. The first board consisted of P. Bogen, Joh. Gmeiner, Hugo Wetlesen, Carl Dietrich Hildisch, Helge Offerdahl and Wilhelm Nicolaysen. The first production facility was located in Fredrikstad, planned and constructed by Carl Fredrik Holmboe. In 1923 Holmboe became chief executive officer. De-No-Fa launched a cooperation with the soap company Lilleborg in 1925, and eventually acquired it as a daughter company. Later, a 50% stake in the company was bought by Unilever (formerly Lever Brothers), where Carl Fredrik Holmboe was chief engineer prior to his period in De-No-Fa. Holmboe left the CEO position in 1946. In 1959 Unilever's stake was bought by Borregaard. In 1960 De-No-Fa and Lilleborg was merged to form DeNoFa Lilleborg. The company owned Stabburet from 1969 to 1985. The year after that, Borregaard was acquired by the Orkla Group. Lilleborg was demerged in 1996 to again form a separate company, but remained a part of the Orkla Group. In 2005, 40% of Denofa was bought by Unikorn. Orkla now owns 20%, while the remaining 40% are owned by the Brazilian company Inlogs. In addition, Denofa owns 60% of the Polish company Nagrol. Denofa has also been active in Russia, and opened a sales office in Romania in 1996. In addition to Fredrikstad, Denofa also owns a production facility in Leknes, acquired after buying 100% of the company Marine Lipids. In 2004 it was decided to close the fat refinery in Fredrikstad. At that time the plant employed 120 people, already downsized from 450 over a fifteen-year period. The extraction plant (nicknamed X-verket) with 70 employees, located adjacent to the fat refinery, was also threatened with closing. However, it was retained following the influx of fresh capital from Unikorn. The changes marked a stronger leaning towards soy. The soybeans are imported from Brazil; in addition grain from Norway is used. The company currently has 60 employees, and the current CEO is Bjarne Rask Thomsen"

The restaurant has its origins in the owners' original opening of a \"fine-dining\" establishment. The establishment was a failure, which resulted in bankruptcy. Rather than continue with the upscale restaurant motif, the owners retooled their efforts and decided to \"go sloppy\". The end result was a success, leading to the creation of six additional locations. In 1995, the company attempted to expand to Europe and opened a restaurant in London, but the effort was abandoned and the restaurant was sold in early 1996."

Demand Media was created in 2006 by a former private equity investor, Shawn Colo, and the former chairman of MySpace, Richard Rosenblatt. The company employs an algorithm that identifies topics with high advertising potential, based on search engine query data and bids on advertising auctions. These topics are typically in the advice and how-to field. It then commissions freelancers to produce corresponding text or video content. The content is posted on a variety of sites, including YouTube and the company's own sites such as eHow, Airliners.net, and LIVESTRONG.COM."

The brand aimed at marking Hilton's entry into the global lifestyle brand sector, and the new concept/brand was introduced on Tuesday, March 10, 2009 in Berlin, Germany. However, due to a current standing legal situation, Denizen's development has now been halted and the brand is considered \"dead\". In April, 2009 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide filed suit against Hilton and their Denizen brand, accusing two former Starwood executives including Ross Klein, the former president of Starwood Hotels of stealing and taking trade secrets to Hilton for the development of the new brand. Hilton suspended development of the Denizen brand and placed the team on paid administrative leave. On April 24, 2009 a US district judge enjoined Starwood and ordered Hilton to stop development of its brand pending further investigation of corporate espionage. In December 2010, Hilton Worldwide has agreed to settle the lawsuit with Starwood hotels. As part of the settlement, Hilton has agreed to make a $75 million cash payment. Starwood is also be entitled to another $75 million in hotel-management contracts. In addition, Hilton is subjected to an injunction that prohibits the hotel chain from introducing any lifestyle hotels for two years. And two court-appointed monitors will be required to supervise Hilton’s operations and ensure it complies with the injunction."

  "text" : "The Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works (founded in 1871), was a major late–19th-century American shipyard located on the Delaware River in Chester, Pennsylvania. It was founded by the industrialist John Roach and is often referred to by its parent company name of John Roach & Sons, or just known as the Roach shipyard. For the first fifteen years of its existence, the shipyard was by far the largest and most productive in the United States, building more tonnage of ships than its next two major competitors combined, in addition to being the U.S. Navy's largest contractor. The yard specialized in the production of large passenger freighters, but built every kind of vessel from warships to cargo ships, oil tankers, ferries, barges, tugs and yachts. Following a protracted dispute over a U.S. Navy contract for the USS Dolphin in the early 1880s, the company's founder John Roach placed John Roach & Sons into receivership in 1885. After settlement of the parent company's debts, the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works was reopened by Roach's sons and continued in operation until shortly after the death of Roach's eldest son John Baker Roach in 1908, at which point the Roach family retired from the shipbuilding business. Over the course of its 37-year history, the Roach shipyard had many notable achievements to its credit. In 1874 it built City of Peking and City of Tokio, the two largest gross-tonnage ships ever built in the United States to that date and the second largest in the world after the experimental British behemoth Great Eastern. In 1883 it constructed America's first steamer with a steel-plated hull,Alaskan. The yard played a key role in the so-called \"Birth of the New Navy\" when it built the four \"ABCD ships\"—the U.S. Navy's first steel ships. It also established a reputation for itself as a builder of lavishly outfitted \"night boats\" for the Long Island Sound trade, and in its last years, built the first three American ships to be powered by steam turbines. In total, the Delaware River Works built 179 ships between 1871 and 1908, including 10 warships for the U.S. Navy. Following the retirement of the Roach family in 1908, the shipyard remained idle for some years until being reopened as the Chester Shipbuilding Co. by a naval officer, C. P. M. Jack, in 1913. It was subsequently purchased in 1917 by W. Averell Harriman for building merchant ships during World War I, when it was renamed the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation. The yard closed permanently in 1923, and the location repurposed as the Ford Motor Company Chester Assembly factory until 1961."

Founded in 1996 by Hanno Beck, Mike O'Mara, and former libertarian Andrew Spark, the caucus is roughly analogous to the Republican Party's Republican Liberty Caucus, although the DFC's influence on its party may be more marginalized. Like the RLC, the DFC shares many principles with Libertarian Party, but believes that effective political change is more likely to come through a major party than a third party. The caucus maintains a platform, a list of principles, a guide for activists and includes 40 state chairs and regional representatives."

  "text" : "Dataproducts Corporation was an early manufacturer of computer peripheral equipment. Initially known as Data Products, the company was founded by Erwin Tomash in 1962 in order to take controlling interest of Telex's Data Systems Division. The division was behind on a contract to deliver disk files to General Electric. Dataproducts was able to complete the product and deliver to GE and later Ferranti, ICL and RCA. Sustained by the disk drive business and Informatics, Data Products began development of their first line printer. Introduced in 1963, the 3300 was a 300 line per minute drum printer that used a moving coil actuator for the print hammer. In 1966, core memory was added to the product line. With heightened sales and earnings, Data Products moved to a new site in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California in 1968. They started acquiring other businesses, including Staff Dynamics, a personnel agency and Uptime, a manufacturer of card readers. Graham Tyson replaced Tomash as CEO in 1971. The disk business was ailing in the face of increased competition and finally discontinued. Dataproducts switched from drum to band technology in the late 1970s and added dot matrix printers along with a series of thermal printers sourced from Olivetti. The telecommunications company Stelma was purchased and Data Card was formed to manufacture plastic card embossing equipment. Daisy wheel printers were added to the line with a purchase of the business from Plessey in 1978. A joint project with Exxon yielded a series of solid ink printers. Dataproducts used Toshiba engines for their first laser printers in 1989. Legal battles with Tektronix and Apple over the solid ink patents drained resources and ended with Apple discontinuing their product and Tektronix paying royalties. Jack C. Davis, 47, a former Harris Corporation senior vice president, replaced Graham Tyson as chairman and chief executive in May, 1986. By 1989, net income had dropped from a high of $27.7 million to $3.8 million, and Dataproducts fought off takeover attempts by a consortium. Dataproducts was purchased by Hitachi Koki Co. Ltd., a unit of Hitachi in 1990. Dataproducts later used Fuji Xerox engines for their Typhoon series of laser printers. The LZR1560/1580 was OEMed as the Apple LaserWriter Pro 810 in 1993. In 1998, the LZR 5200 continuous feed laser printer was announced. The Dataproducts brand name was used until it was formed into Hitachi Koki Imaging Systems in 1999."

Although DMZGlobal has grown significantly since the acquisition it ceased being a limited company in its own right in New Zealand and Australia when on 31 December 2006 it was absorbed back in Sytec Resources Ltd. Subsequently on 30 June 2007 Sytec was also de-registered and absorbed into TelstraClear. The DMZGlobal (Australia) Pty Ltd company was de-registered on the 10th of December 2008. TelstraClear's Large Enterprise division merged with Sytec to form TelstraClear Enterprise and Government and align the organisational structure with Australian parent Telstra. As a division of TelstraClear it was part of Vodafone purchase that was approved by the Commerce Commission and the Overseas Investment Office on 30 October 2012 DMZGlobal used to be famous for its Ford BA Falcons and sponsorship of a boat in the New Zealand Offshore powerboat racing series, in particular the 2002 championship winning team piloted by the company's original founder Grant Smith."

By 1870 the business had grown to incorporate seven of the surrounding stores, with one of the buildings being used as a mourning department. The company prided itself as being the supplier of goods to the upper class of Kensington. In 1920 John Barker & Co., the department store next door, acquired Derry & Toms. The firm already owned Pontings, which was adjacent to Derry & Toms on the other side. In 1919 Derry & Toms employed the services of poster artist F Gregory Brown to produce advertising. His advert The Daintiest of Legwear at Derry & Toms sold for £6,240 at Bonhams in 2007. In 1930 building work was started and the new, seven-storey building on Kensington High Street opened in 1933. The building was designed by Bernard George in an Art Deco style popular at the time, and featured metalwork by Walter Gilbert and panel reliefs, entitled Labour & Technology, by Charles Henry Mabey Jnr. The building is most famous for its Kensington Roof Gardens, which opened in 1938 and still exists today. The garden was designed by landscape architect Ralph Hancock after the Managing Director of Barkers, Trevor Bowen, visited Rockefeller Center in New York. The main restaurant, situated on the fifth floor, was called \"The Rainbow Room\" and became a venue for thousands of \"Dinner & Dances\" (banquets), for both private firms and government departments. In 1957 John Barker & Co was bought by House of Fraser, bringing Derry & Toms under their stewardship. The store was sold in 1971 to Biba. Derry & Toms continued to operate until 1973, when it finally closed. It was replaced in 1974 by Big Biba, which itself closed in 1975. British Land developed the site into offices and shops. The location is now used by Marks and Spencers, H&M, and Gap, and as offices for Sony Music UK and Warner Music Group. In 2012, the American luxury fitness chain Equinox opened its first UK location on the fifth floor. Since 1978 the roof garden has been listed as Grade II, and since 1981 the building has been a Grade II* Listed Building."

Reidel himself had been trained under an ex-Elsevier manager, M. D. Frank, who considered third generation Dutch publishers like Reidel to be the \"grandchildren\" of the German publishing company, Aka GmbH Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft (academic publishing company) of Leipzig, where Frank himself was trained.Aka itself was co-founded by Walter Jalowicz (who changed his name to Johnson and later worked for Academic Press in New York) and his son-in-law K.

  "text" : "Dionex Corporation is an American company based in Sunnyvale, California. It develops, manufactures, sells, and services chromatography, ion chromatography and extraction systems for separating, isolating, and identifying the components of chemical mixtures. Such equipment is used in medical research, environmental monitoring and food testing. Dionex developed the Chromeleon brand of chromatography software. The primary function of Chromeleon is to control and obtain data from Dionex analytical instruments although the software supports instruments from other vendors. Chromeleon 7 is the latest edition of the software. The technology made by Dionex includes the Rapid Separation LC (RSLC) and polymeric HPLC columns, a type of monolithic HPLC column. Unlike the inorganic silica columns, the polymer monoliths are made of an organic polymer base. Dionex, traditionally known for its ion chromatography capabilities, has led this side of the field. Dionex first acquired a license for the polymeric monolith technology in the 1990s. Dionex also acquired ESA Biosciences' HPLC assets in 2009, expanding its expertise in this area. In December 2010 Thermo Fisher Scientific announced its acquisition of Dionex for $2.1 billion."

  "text" : "Daytop, or Daytop Village, is a drug addiction treatment organization with facilities in New York City and New Jersey. It was founded in 1963 by Dr. Daniel Casriel M.D along with Monsignor William B. O'Brien, a Roman Catholic priest and founder and president of the World Federation of Therapeutic Communities. According to Dr. Casriel its name was originally an acronym for 'Drug Addicts Yield to Probation' as Daytop was originally a kind of \"halfway house\" for convicted addicts. Another account gives the name to be an acronym for \"Drug Addicts Yield to Persuasion\". A third account gives the name to be an acronym for \"Drug Addicts Yield to Others Persuasion.\" The Daytop program, one of the oldest drug-treatment programs in the United States, is based on the therapeutic community model and emphasizes the role of peer interaction in their modes of treatment. Considered one of the most successful programs of its kind, it is described as \"a supportive emotional community in which people feel secure but at the same time are held strictly accountable for their behavior\". It is estimated that 85 percent of those treated stay clean. It was during a 1980 visit to Dayton village that then first lady Nancy Reagan initially became aware of the drug epidemic in the United States and the toll it was taking on the nation's youth. This event is widely acknowledged at the genesis of her \"Just Say No\" program. In late 2015, Daytop Village merged with Samaritan Village, another 50+ year old health and human services nonprofit organization with a specialty in drug and alcohol treatment. The newly merged organization changed its name to Samaritan Daytop Village."

  "text" : "Denholm & McKay Co. was a department store located in Worcester, Massachusetts. The store was a dominant retailer in Central Massachusetts. The store was popularly known as Denholm's or the Boston Store. The company was founded by William Alexander Denholm in 1870. Denholm purchased the dry-goods business of Finley, Lawson, & Kennedy located on the corner of Main and Mechanic street in Worcester. He partnered with Bostonian William C. McKay, which proved to be very successful. In twelve years Denholm and McKay had grown into a retailing giant. That year, the company moved into a new huge quarters specially built for them. Denholm's held a reputation as the biggest store of its kind in New England outside Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. In 1954 the old victorian style facade from 1882 was replaced with a new ultra-modern one, which remains mostly the same today. In 1971 Denholm's opened its first and only branch at the Auburn Mall, just south of Worcester in Auburn, Massachusetts. In 1969 Gladdings Department Store of Providence merged with Denholm & Mckay. Both stores closed in 1973 due to bankruptcy. The store in downtown Worcester was converted into an office complex, but still bears the Denholm name. The store in the Auburn Mall was converted into a Forbes & Wallace of Springfield, Massachusetts."

  "text" : "Dockwise was formed in September 1993 by the merger of two complementary companies, Wijsmuller Transport (a division of Heerema) and Dock Express Shipping (a division of Royal Vopak), becoming the world's largest seagoing heavy transport shipping company. The combined company operated from a new headquarters in Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium. Wijsmuller brought a fleet of seven semi-submersible vessels (Mighty Servant 1, Mighty Servant 2 & Mighty Servant 3 and Super Servant 3, 4, 5, & 6) and four dock-type vessels (Dock Express 10, 11, 12, & 20). In 2001 Offshore Heavy Transport ASA (OHT) joined the company, adding two heavy transport vessels, MV Black Marlin and MV Blue Marlin. In November 2010, to service the emerging market for ultra-large transports, such as its Dockwise’s Type 0 heavy lift vessel, it appointed Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) of Korea as its shipbuilding yard. HHI was scheduled to deliver the vessel during the last quarter of 2012. Type 0 was renamed the Dockwise Vanguard."

Dmailer software products are bundled with SanDisk, Western Digital, Verbatim Corporation, Imation, LaCie, Lexar and other manufacturers’ portable storage products worldwide. Dmailer licensed its patent-pending synchronization engine technology to a number of companies. The company's flagship product, Dmailer Sync, was available in 19 languages and was sold in more than 130 countries worldwide with more than 50 million copies shipped to date. Dmailer’s data backup software supports both local and online backup. On March 23, 2010, Dmailer launched a free version of its backup software (Dmailer Backup v3). The software application allows users to perform live backup and online backup of any storage device, as well as to back up PC and Mac platforms locally, via USB drive, CD, mobile device or external hard drive. No software installation is needed to restore data. It included 2 GB of free storage online through Dmailer Online, an online storage service that backed up secure copies to a remote server for access from any computer. Dmailer Backup v3 restores data to its original location or elsewhere and also performs customized backup. All product customer support, the Dmailer Sync Product and Dmailer Online service are discontinued. Dmailer technical assets have been bought by Gemalto and are now included in the YuuWaa service."

  "text" : "The Dime Savings Bank of New York, originally the Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn, operated from 1859 to 2002. It should not be confused with the Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh, also headquartered in Brooklyn, New York City. The bank's former headquarters building at 9 DeKalb Avenue at Fleet Street in the Civic Center area of Brooklyn was built in 1906-08 and was designed by Mowbray & Uffinger in the Classical Revival style. It was significantly enlarged by Halsey, McCormack & Helmer in 1931-32. The interior of the building is \"remarkable\" and features large gilded Mercury-head dimes and twelve red marble columns supporting the rotunda; these were added in the 1931-32 expansion. The building was designated a New York City Landmark on July 19, 1994. Dime was acquired by Washington Mutual in 2002, which subsequently failed in 2008. Dime was included in the assets that were sold to JPMorgan Chase by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after Washington Mutual was seized and placed in receivership. In December 2015, developers Michael Stern and Joe Chetrit completed purchasing the building for $90 million, having entered contract talks with JPMorgan Chase the previous summer. They plan to incorporate the landmark building into a new supertall skyscraper, using the 300,000 square feet of air-rights that come with the Dime Savings Bank property."

Established in 1971, it has since grown into a global business with more than 64 production sites, research and development and sales centres in more than 40 countries worldwide. Daewoo Electronics Sales UK (DESUK) was established in November 1993. It is the third largest electronics firm of South Korea after Samsung and LG. The company manufactures a range of high value electronics and home appliances. The company went through a bankruptcy in 1999 after Asian financial crisis and is currently owned completely by a group of creditors. Beside its business of manufacturing consumer goods, it has been contracted by different parties to set up local manufacturing units producing air-conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines. In October 2010, it was announced that the creditor group owning the company is to sell it to an Iran-based electronic company. Entekhab Industrial Group of Iran would buy the firm for 529 million dollars in November 2010 from its creditors.Entekhab industrial Group competed with Electrolux of Sweden for the acquisition. In June 2011, it was reported that creditors of Daewoo decided to drop the deal with Entekhab group over funding uncertainties; Entekhab Group threatened to take legal actions in response. After years of trying, in Jan 2013, Dongbu Group agreed to take over Daewoo Electronics (270 million$) to attain synergies effect with Dongbu families (Especially Dongbu CNI, Dongbu Hiteck and Dongbu Steel). Daewoo Electronics became the family of Dongbu Group by ending its workout status."

In 1996, when the skateboarding became in vogue they saw an opportunity in making baggy pants especially for skaters. The pants were soon sold out and the founders called their brothers, Micky Zúñiga and Pablo Sayán, to manufacture additionally 300 pants which were also sold. They followed with t-shirts, jeans and then clothes for skaters and surfers. Until 2003, Dunkelvolk was a brand mostly for skaters. In 2003 the company expanded its product line and hosted the Peruvian surfer Javier Swayne. Today the Pride Corporation S.R.L.(Lima), owner of the brand Dunkelvolk, manufactures and markets in Peru, but also exports to other countries as United States, Spain, Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil, Austria and Australia."

Items that were produced by the company are known as \"Duncan glass\" or \"Duncan Miller glass.\" The company was founded in 1865 by George Duncan with his two sons and son-in-law in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By 1890, the company joined other glass companies to form the United States Glass Company, a powerful glass trust. In 1892, the factory was destroyed in a fire, and the company was relieved of its trust relationship with the US Glass Company. After the fire, the second generation of the Duncan family moved operations to Washington, Pennsylvania. In 1900, John Ernest Miller, the company's long-time designer, became a full shareholder along with members of the Duncan family. By 1955, economic pressures from machine-produced glass forced the company to sell off its assets to the US Glass Company, who continued to produce Duncan-style glass until 1980."

In 1973 Harold Eidem set up B&T Holdings Ltd to provide centralized services and act as the parent company to all of their business’ locations. In 1976, Harold Eidem died and the ownership of the company was transferred to his sons Brian and Earl Eidem and daughter Jo-Ann Thompson. In 1981, B&T Holdings changed its name to DynaVest Corp. to better indicate the new direction of the companies. In 2000, the Eidem family sold three major components of their holdings to Applied Industrial Technologies.  That same year the company would again change names, DynaVest became DynaVenture and the Eidem family have since increased their holdings in technology and engineering companies."

  "text" : "The Director of Public Transport (the Director or the DPT) was the head of the Public Transport Division (PTD) of the Victorian Department of Transport. PTD was the government agency responsible for promoting, providing, coordinating and regulating public transport in the State of Victoria, Australia between August 1999 and April 2012. The Director of Public Transport was created as a statutory office supported by staff of the Department of Transport. The key responsibilities of the Director centred on the entering into and management of franchising contracts with train, tram and bus companies to provide public transport services in Melbourne and Victoria. The Director also had oversight of the Victorian Taxi Directorate which regulates the taxi and hire car industry in Victoria. As part of its operational functions, the DPT also had responsibilities relating to public transport planning and projects as well as the accreditation of passenger transport companies for enforcement purposes and the appointment and management of authorised officers for enforcement activities across Victoria's public transport system. On 2 April 2012, the majority of the Director's functions were transferred to either the newly created Public Transport Victoria or the Secretary of the Department of Transport. The office of the Director of Public Transport was abolished on 1 July 2013."

  "text" : "DealCenter is a social media platform and online meeting management system used at trade shows and events for arranging face-to-face meetings. DealCenter, LLC was established January 2008 though the online meeting planner has been designed and in use by Jaymie Scotto & Associates as an event planning product since 2005, pre-dating today’s social networking communities. The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the list of attendees by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event. The DealCenter system is traditionally rolled out months before the show date, so attendees can pre-plan their meetings and attend the event with a scheduled timetable of targeted prospect, customer or partner meetings. To utilize the platform, attendees and exhibitors log on to the customized event website and are able to see the profiles of other participants who will be attending the event. The DealCenter manages the meeting schedules, accepts or declines invitations and allows users to send secure messages via the DealCenter to further expand the business opportunity pipeline. All the planning is done through the platform interface, enabling users to arrive with a roster of meetings already scheduled and confirmed. No contact information is shared or released unless the user voluntarily provides it. The confirmed meetings are assigned a table number and held on-site in a designated area, including, if desired, meeting rooms, bilateral tables, exhibit booths and/or a DealCenter Area. The DealCenter Concierge Service is a new development within the DealCenter technology. The Concierge Service automatically schedules meetings on a user's behalf based on the information provided when creating a profile."

The new company, David Hutcheson & Co. had three partners, David Hutcheson, Alexander Hutcheson and David MacBrayne. In 1878, the company passed to David MacBrayne, partner and nephew of Messrs. Burns. The Company rapidly became the main carrier on the West Highland routes, providing passenger and freight services to most islands. They initially operated from Glasgow down the Firth of Clyde through the Crinan Canal to Oban and Fort William, and on through the Caledonian Canal to Inverness. They added the mail run to Islay, Harris and North Uist from Skye and then the Outer Isles run from Oban to Barra and South Uist. As each opened, they added the railheads at Oban, Mallaig, Kyle of Lochalsh and Strome Ferry. MacBraynes remained in the hands of the family until 1928, when it was unable to support a bid for the renewal of the mail contract and effectively became bankrupt. No other operator was found for the contract and the company was reformed, with ownership divided between Coast Lines and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway."

  "text" : "Detour Gold Corp. is a Canadian intermediate gold mining company with a primary focus on the successful ramp up of its flagship asset - the Detour Lake Mine, located in the mining-friendly territory of northeastern Ontario. Most of the company's employees are from the Cochrane and Timmins, Ontario area. Detour has continued to strive to maximize local employment in the communities surrounding the mine operation and with their Aboriginal partner communities, offering both job opportunities and training. The Detour Lake project was purchased from Pelangio Mines Ltd. in 2007 (the option property from Goldcorp in 2008).Detour Gold's proven gold reserves of 15.6 million ounces is comparable to that of Canada's Osisko Mining, whose main property is also in the vicinity of the Abitibi gold belt. The company acquired the asset in 2006 from Pelangio Mines Ltd. for $75 million just before it went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange on January 31, 2007. Initially the mine was assessed as having an indicated mineral resource of 3.4 million ounces. In September 2009 a study suggested that the mine was capable of producing gold at a rate of 560,000 ounces per year (that was raised to 649,000 by mid-2010). The company's main asset has 2P reserves of 15.6 million ounces (up from 14.9M oz Jan 2011, up 36% since 2010) and ranks 4th among North America's gold deposits by size (up from 6, July 2010); further exploration could push that up to 20 million ounces. The mine is located in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt near the Abitibi gold belt of Quebec/Ontario. In February 2013, Detour Gold poured its first doré bars at Detour Lake, and has since continued to ramp up its project through the remainder of the year, achieving commercial production in August."

DNV GL is the world's largest classification society with 13,175 vessels and mobile offshore units (MOUs) amounting to 265.4 mill gt in its portfolio, which represents a global market share of 21%. The organization is also a reference in renewable, alternative and conventional energy.

Prior to this merger, both DNV and GL had acquired several companies such as Hélimax Energy (Canada), Garrad Hassan (UK), Windtest (Germany), and KEMA (Netherlands), which have contributed to expanding DNV GL's current capacity to offer its expertise across several industries, most notably in renewable energy, maritime, oil & gas, electrification, and business assurance. In addition to providing services, it also invests heavily in research and development. The company currently has 16,000 employees with headquarters close to Oslo, Norway, and operates with the vision \"Global Impact for a Safe and Sustainable Future\". Remi Eriksen took over as Group President and CEO of DNV GL on August 1, 2015, succeeding Henrik O. Madsen."

The brewery has also released an India Pale Ale style called \"The Corruption,\" a Belgian-style pale ale called \"The Citizen,\" and a pilsner called \"Brau Pils,\" as well as many limited releases. All of the brewery's waste is delivered to a family-owned farm in Haymarket, Virginia, where it is converted into animal feed and composting material. The brewery also plans to have the farm plant a crop of hops for a single batch brew, and have that be a limited annual release. DC Brau also supported a bill before the D.C. City Council that would allow on-site beer tasting at breweries within the city's limits. D.C. law previously only allowed on-site tastings at grocery stores and retailers that do not manufacture beer at the same location, prohibiting the brewery itself from opening a tasting room. DC Brau now offers tastings, pints, and growler fills, as well as free brewery tours."

  "text" : "DEJ Productions was an American film studio founded in 1998 by Dean Wilson, Ed Stead and John Antioco. The studio distributed 225 films in just eight years, including the Academy Award-winning Monster starring Charlize Theron and the multiple Academy Award-winning Crash which won Best Picture of the Year. DEJ was a film acquisition company which began in 1998, shortly after the introduction of the medium of DVD. The home video industry was undergoing a major economic change and DEJ was established to pick-up low-budget films primarily to get exclusive DVD releases for its parent company, Blockbuster Video. DEJ was named after the first initials of three top Blockbuster executives at the time, its Executive Vice President Dean Wilson, its General Counsel and Executive Vice President of Business Development Ed Stead, and its CEO John Antioco. The company released a few of its acquired films theatrically. A notable example was the U.S. rights to the Sylvester Stallone film D-Tox, which Universal Studios declined to distribute in the U.S. DEJ picked up the film and released it under the title Eye See You, a name it also used in the home video release. Based in Los Angeles, DEJ picked up around three dozen films annually. Its first film acquired was the home video distribution of Still Breathing, starring Brendan Fraser. It acquired the rights to the biopics of two mass murderers in Dahmer and Gacy. DEJ also picked up films such as Party Monster and Grand Theft Parsons at festivals including the Sundance Film Festival. In the case of a theatrical release such as 2004's My Date With Drew, Blockbuster stores would promote the film both in its store and on its website. Because DEJ was in the Blockbuster corporate umbrella during a period in which Viacom owned Blockbuster, DEJ could also sell the rights to Viacom's cable networks including Starz or Showtime while obtaining video rights to first run titles airing on the cable channels such as Whoopi Goldberg's made-for-Showtime film, Good Fences. In the media industry, this was considered a synergistic business model. One of the founding partners, Dean Wilson, explained DEJ's philosophy on convincing filmmakers of their business model in an interview in 2002. He said, \"A lot of filmmakers initially have this belief that they're not a success unless they end up in a theater...They all want to be Spielberg and all want to make tons of money eventually, but I think that in a lot of these early projects, they put everything into it, and I would love to see theatrical release. But I think they're now coming to terms with the fact theatrical release isn't available for everything. We offer up exposure to people, which, when it comes down to it, is really what they want.\" Because of some success in the home video marketplace with a few of the picked up films, DEJ ended its exclusive deal with Blockbuster to gain wider release of some of its breakout titles. An example was when DEJ picked up the home video rights to The Boondock Saints which had failed at the box office but proceeded to make almost $12 million in home video and spawning a sequel. DEJ began co-financing higher profile films for theatrical release including, Monster and Crash. DEJ’s first Oscar winner was Charlize Theron in Monster. The following year, the independent film Crash was the winner of several Academy Awards including Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Writing of an Original Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, as well as 41 other awards from various organizations. DEJ’s increasing notoriety led to more involvement in the production side, which was a change in its business model. The first result was that the company scaled back the number of productions it was involved with. The second was that the financial risk increased as the push for quality was raised. \"As a company that's looking to grow over time, the objective is to find projects that are bigger and better,\" said DEJ VP of acquisitions Andy Reimer. With the shift in business came both business practices and ownership change. First Look Studios combined sales forces with DEJ as First Look began to distribute some of DEJ’s home video product starting in 2001. Four years later, First Look Studios purchased DEJ from Blockbuster for $25 million in 2005. It received DEJ’s entire inventory of 225 films, as well, in exchange for home video revenue sharing with Blockbuster. DEJ's Dean Wilson moved over to First Look as its Chief Operating Officer. By 2010, First Look Studios fortunes had eroded and the company was disbanded following bankruptcy. While the DEJ nameplate was largely discontinued by 2006 just after the First Look buyout, its logo can still be seen in video releases as Millennium Entertainment acquired much of the DEJ and First Look film library in 2010. In 2011, the filmmakers who made Animal for DEJ received a favorable decision concerning the profits made in the 2005 direct-to-video release."

  "text" : "DigiNotar was a Dutch certificate authority owned by VASCO Data Security International. On September 3, 2011, after it had become clear that a security breach had resulted in the fraudulent issuing of certificates, the Dutch government took over operational management of DigiNotar's systems. That same month, the company was declared bankrupt. An investigation into the hacking by Dutch-government appointed Fox-IT consultancy identified 300,000 Iranian Gmail users as the main target of the hack (targeted subsequently using man-in-the-middle attacks), and suspected that the Iranian government was behind the hack. While nobody has been charged with the break-in and compromise of the certificates (as of 2013), cryptographer Bruce Schneier says the attack may have been \"either the work of the NSA, or exploited by the NSA.\" However, this has been disputed, with others saying the NSA had only detected a foreign intelligence service using the fake certificates. The hack has also been claimed by the so-called Comodohacker, allegedly a 21-year-old Iranian student, who also claimed to have hacked four other certificate authorities, including Comodo, a claim found plausible by F-Secure, although not fully explaining how it led to the subsequent \"widescale interception of Iranian citizens\". After more than 500 fake DigiNotar certificates were found, major web browser makers reacted by blacklisting all DigiNotar certificates. The scale of the incident was used by some organizations likeENISA and AccessNow.org to call for a deeper reform of HTTPS in order to remove the weakest link possibility that a single compromised CA can affect that many users."

A Sundance script ‘The Lunchbox’ was showcased at Cannes and The Dubai International Film Festival, amongst many others. It was bestowed with the Best Screenplay and Jury Grand Prize at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards 2013. Dar Motion Pictures is among the few mainstream Bollywood production houses that actively produce both Hindi and regional cinema. Opening with the hard hitting and riveting Lalbaug Parel (Marathi) & City of Gold (2010 film)(Hindi), DAR moved on to produce many Marathi and Hindi films including and Teecha Baap Tyacha Baap (Marathi), Haunted 3D, D-Day, Mickey Virus, Peddlers, Monsoon Shootout and The Lunchbox. Further through its distribution arm, ‘DAR Film Distributors’, it has been behind the distribution of two of the most successful Hollywood films in India namely, ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and ‘Fast & Furious 6’, and released Girish Malik’s ‘Jal’ which was the only Indian film in competition at the Busan International Film Festival 2013. Among other marathi films that DAR Film Distributors have distributed are Dhag, Postcard and Cappuccino. Continuing in the tradition creating fresh content beyond the language barrier, DAR, along with its partners, is soon to give Marathi cinema its first true superhero film ‘Baji’ starring. 2014 will also see some great projects rolling out of DAR, a few of them being Baji, Anurag Kashyap’s ‘—Ugly’, ‘Fattack’ with Bejoy Nambiar’s Getaway Films Pvt.

  "text" : "DreamWorks Pictures (also known DreamWorks SKG or DreamWorks Studios, commonly referred to as DreamWorks, trading as Storyteller Distribution Co., LLC) is an American film production label of Amblin Partners. It was formerly distributing its own and third-party films by itself. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each. As of October 2016, DreamWorks' films are marketed and distributed by Universal Pictures. DreamWorks began in 1994 as an attempt by media moguls Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen (together, SKG) to create a new Hollywood studio of which they owned 72%. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices at Universal Studios. In December 2005, the founders agreed to sell the studio to Viacom, parent of Paramount Pictures. The sale was completed in February 2006. In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and signed a $1.5 billion deal to produce films with India's Reliance ADA Group. Reliance provided $325M of equity to fund recreating DreamWorks SKG into DreamWorks Studios, an independent entity. Clark Hallren, former Managing Director of the Entertainment Industries group of J. P. Morgan Securities, and Alan J. Levine of J. P. Morgan Entertainment Advisors, led the Reliance team in restructuring the company. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement with Walt Disney Studios, wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through Touchstone Pictures; the deal continued until 2016. After the formation of Amblin Partners in 2015, the studio entered into a distribution agreement with Universal Pictures. DreamWorks' animation arm was spun off in 2004 into DreamWorks Animation SKG (DWA), which currently owns the DreamWorks trademarks, and as of August 2016 is a subsidiary of NBCUniversal. Spielberg's company continues to use the DreamWorks trademarks under license from DWA."

Through the 1960s, the Dilmaghani family was still designing, manufacturing and importing Persian carpets from Iran to the United States. Dilmaghani is seen as an important connection of 19th and 20th century Persian rug and carpet production in and around the cities of Tabriz and Kermān. Dilmaghani remains among the best known names of branded 19th, 20th and 21st century hand knotted carpets."

  "text" : "GHI Media, LLC, doing business as Devolver Digital, is an American video game publisher and film distributor based in Austin, Texas, which is primarily associated with the Serious Sam and Hotline Miami series. The company was founded in 2009 by former Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group executives, Mike Wilson, Harry A. Miller IV, and Rick Stults. After partnering with developer Croteam for the Serious Sam series, their first published game was Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter in 2009, which was followed by Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter in 2010. Devolver Digital continued publishing Serious Sam related video games, but also started shifting their focus to smaller independent developers. Their first major indie success was Hotline Miami by Dennaton Games in 2012. Alongside the release of Hotline Miami, Devolver Digital opened a second office in London, England, led by Graeme Struthers and Andrew Parsons, to more easily be able to reach out to developers based in Europe, and to keep track of their public relations in Europe. In 2013, the company opened their film distribution arm, Devolver Digital Films, which aims at helping independent filmmakers by digitally distributing and promoting their work."

  "text" : "Digital Broadcasting Corporation Hong Kong Limited (DBC) (Chinese: 香港數碼廣播有限公司), former known as Wave Media Limited (Chinese: 雄濤廣播有限公司), is a licensed independent digital audio broadcasting (DAB+) operator with most number of channels in Hong Kong. DBC was granted license by the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority in March 2011. There are currently four operators providing digital audio broadcasting services with a total of 18 channels. Being the largest digital broadcaster in the territory, DBC operates 7 channels. Major shareholder of DBC is Bill Wong. Board of directors are Arthur Li, Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong and Loh Chan. In summer 2012,DBC underwent a period of corporate dispute, leading the station to closure. Albert Cheng said shareholder Bill Wong had refused to invest more funds after receiving instructions from an unnamed official at the Central Government's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The radio station announced its closure on 10 October 2012. On 19 October 2012, activists and radio hosts began a three-day sit-in protest in front of the government headquarters in Admiralty. On 20 December 2013, DBC held its grand re-launch. Calling an end to the previous corporate dispute was the restructuring of board of directors. Albert Cheng is no longer a shareholder of nor a host in DBC. DBC decided to close and return its operating licence to the government with effect from 7 September 2016 affecting 113 staff, because the digital audio broadcasting was not popular, and it did not receive enough advertisement to support the revenue."

The company gained worldwide fame in 2001 with the controversial game Hooligans: Storm Over Europe, a strategy game with the objective to become the most popular group of soccer hooligans in Europe. Despite the controversy, much media attention and a bestseller status in the Netherlands and Belgium, the game was not a huge success worldwide. DarXarbre didn't even manage to find a big game publisher for Hooligans: Storm Over Europe in all the countries it was released. In 2011 DarXabre - still led by Garber – made a brief and unsuccessful comeback as a developer of apps for the iPhone and iPad. In 2011 it released two app games for iOS: Banana Banzai (a colorful platform game) and Das Haus Anubis - Die Rache der Spinx (based on the children's series House of Anubis and developed for MTV Networks Germany)."

The company pioneered the use of pyroxylin plastic in hair combs, toilet articles, and a number of different products. In 1914, the Viscoloid Company began marketing pyroxylin plastic toys. The toy industry quickly became the company’s most profitable, and the Viscoloid was soon the leading pyroxylin plastic toy manufacturer in America. By 1923, Bernard Doyle had taken over the company and “The Viscoloid” spanned 106 buildings and was the largest employer in Leominster. In 1925, the company was sold to the Dupont Company of Leominster and was renamed the Dupont Viscoloid Company, Inc. The company would continually be a giant in the plastics industry until closing in November 1977."

  "text" : "De Marchi is a premium Italian sportswear manufacturer and one of the oldest known cycling clothing brands. Its date of founding goes back to a few months after the end of World War II in 1946. Its founder, Emilio De Marchi (1906–1992) was an athlete and manager for Bottecchia, a major professional cycling team of his time named after the great Italian cyclist Ottavio Bottecchia. De Marchi became instantly famous in the cycling world for the superior quality of the wool (Merino) used to produce cycling jerseys and cycling shorts. It was also among the first cycling clothing manufacturers to introduce circular knitting construction technique that allowed the creation of more comfortable jerseys, and buckskin leather (obtained from softer chamois leather), to make cycling short’s pads as opposed to sheep, that was more commonly used before.More recently, in 1991, De Marchi has been the first brand to patent and sell a high-technology cycling pad. Made completely in microfiber fabric, anatomical heat-formed shaped, with air cooling silicone gel filling, “Soft-Gel” laid the basis for a more comfortable cycling ride to both professional and recreational athletes.In 2000 De Marchi patented an innovative bikepad that acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle which drastically reduced irritation and quickly became a standard in high quality cycling wear. De Marchi has been uninterruptedly run by the same family since it was founded."

The company was founded in 2008 at Stanford University and was the first company funded by StartX (then Stanford Student Enterprises), Stanford's on-campus venture capital fund. The company has gained interest from its application of computer vision technology to web pages, wherein it visually parses a web page for important elements and returns them in a structured format. In 2015 Diffbot announced it was working on its version of an automated \"Knowledge Graph\" by crawling the web and using its automatic web page extraction to build a large database of structured web data. The company's products allow software developers to analyze web home pages and article pages, and extract the \"important information\" while ignoring elements deemed not core to the primary content. In August 2012 the company released its Page Classifier API, which automatically categorizes web pages into specific \"page types\". As part of this, Diffbot analyzed 750,000 web pages shared on the social media service Twitter and revealed that photos, followed by articles and videos, are the predominant web media shared on the social network. The company raised $2 million in funding in May 2012 from investors including Andy Bechtolsheim and Sky Dayton. Diffbot's customers include Adobe, AOL, Cisco, DuckDuckGo, eBay, Instapaper, Microsoft, Onswipe and Springpad."

The Grommet’s mission is rooted in the philosophy of Citizen Commerce, a movement that enables product purchases that express powerful contemporary values around sustainability, quality, technology, and social enterprise. With makers from across the world selling on The Grommet, it focuses on products that are crowdfunded, technology gadgets, products using new materials and manufacturing techniques, handcrafted, made in the USA, natural & eco, and social enterprises. The Grommet challenges the traditional retail model, changing the way people buy products online by helping them find products that align with their own values or retail setting. The Grommet (then The Daily Grommet) was launched in 2008 by Jules Pieri, Co-Founder and CEO, and Joanne Domeniconi, Co-Founder and Chief Discovery Officer. The Grommet is headquartered in Somerville, Massachusetts. The Grommet has launched and helped establish such household brand names as Alex and Ani, BabyCakes, Bananagrams, BluApple, Cuppow, Fitbit, GoldieBlox, IdeaPaint, Mrs. Meyers Clean Day, Otterbox, Plumen, PocketMonkey, SodaStream, Sugru, and Yaktrax Traction Devices, among many others. As part of The Grommet Wholesale’s launch, Pieri and Domeniconi attended The White House to represent The Grommet's role in the Maker Movement on June 18, 2014 as part of The White House’s first-ever Maker Faire. The Daily Grommet sees itself as a next step after crowdfunding success to help new businesses get launched. They also feature new products from major corporations, however, including Google."

  "text" : "D'Lites of America was an American fast food chain based in Norcross, Georgia. It was known for serving fast food with a higher emphasis on nutrition. It featured reduced-calorie dishes, including hamburgers made with lean beef, high-fiber buns, and low-calorie cheese. Additionally there were also popular items like a pita bread vegetarian sandwich, premium hot ham and cheese, frozen yogurt with choice of nutritious toppings, sparkling apple juice, and light beer are among some of the selections offered. If you chose to dine inside the restaurant, there was an enormous, freshly stocked salad bar at each location. It was founded in 1978 by Doug Sheley and Jeffrey Miller. The first franchises opened in 1983. By 1985, more than 100 stores were opened. The chain stopped franchising in 1986 and closed several stores. By year's end, it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 1987, ninety percent of the remaining company-owned stores were sold to Hardee's and were soon rebranded as Hardee's. A few D'Lites restaurants remain, but they are under new ownership and have been renamed to avoid infringement of the D'Lites name. According to FIU Hospitality Review, the chain's closure was due to other chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's beginning to offer healthier sides such as salads and baked potatoes, as well as D'Lites' buying back of several unsuccessful franchise locations."

Most of the barrel aged beers are unique to the tap room and are not usually available for growler or keg fills; Drake's first bottling of a barrel aged beer, Reunion Barley Wine Ale, occurred in 2013."

  "text" : "Datcroft Games is an European video game developer and publisher and successor of a russian video game developer Rusoftware. The company develops and publishes stand-alone large online games as well as mobile games for midcore and hardcore gamers. As for 2013, flagship product of Datcroft Games has been Fragoria, a fantasy browser based MMORPG with a long lifetime. Before and after its launch, Fragoria has been in development for several years and new versions are still being planned and released. Currently the game is available in Flash and Unity. The game can be played directly in browser or through the downloadable client. Fragoria is a real-time Flash game and some claim it represents the next generation in browser games. For almost two years (as for October 2013) the company has been developing also a new cross platform game title with a usual for Datcroft approach of deep storyline, massive game world and state of the art graphics. Unlike Fragoria with its hardcore long gameplay, the new game should be aiming the midcore audience. The games of Datcroft are featured and distributed by leading media companies around the world, such as Mail.ru in Russia, ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Covus (Browsergames.de), Bigpoint Games (license expired) in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France, Suba Games, Wildtangent, Aeria Games in English language, Onet.pl, Wirtualna Polska, Axel Springer AG, Gadu-Gadu in Poland, Antenna TV in Greece, Minijuegos and OCI Group in Spain, Draugas in Lithuania. In addition to its headquarters in London, UK, Datcroft Games maintains offices in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Voronezh, Barnaul, Bar and Balearic Islands (company's European creative hub)."

  "text" : "Day-Elder Motors Corporation (1918-1937, also known as D.E.) was a manufacturer of trucks in Irvington, New Jersey. Production began in 1918. The company originated from the earlier National Motors Manufacturing Company, also of Irvington. The vehicles used proprietary engines, transmissions, and rear axles. The brand used a worm-gear final drive, leading to a smooth drive - this was considered enough of a selling argument that a worm gear was adopted as the brand's logo and heavily used in the brand's advertising. Day-Elder also had a steady market in fire trucks, and chassis were sold to be used as taxicabs in New York City. Some sources state that the brand was applied to trucks at least as early as 1916, although this seems unlikely as the company was only incorporated on December 26, 1916."

It was purchased in 1928 by Dal Negro family. For decades it had several locations in the town of Treviso, before arriving in the new location. In 2003, it bought rival Masenghini but has kept the brands separate. The following year, it acquired Milan-based NTP, which produces plastic playing cards. In recent years the company has increased the production of Tarot decks, which also include a deck made by the Nobel Prize for Literature, Dario Fo."

  "text" : "The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) (هيئة كهرباء ومياه دبي) is a public service infrastructure company that was founded on 1 January 1992 by Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. It arose from the merger of the Dubai Electricity Company and the Dubai Water Department that had been operating independently until then. These organizations were established in 1959 by sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, former ruler of Dubai. The objective of the state-run company is making available to the people of Dubai an adequate and reliable supply of electricity and water. DEWA employs a workforce of over 9,000 employees and provides over 600,000 customers with electricity and over 500,000 customers with water. In April 2015, DEWA had an installed capacity of 9,656 MW of electricity and 470 million imperial gallons of desalinated water per day, with plans to increase this to over 10,000 MW of capacity by 2018. After using conventional gas-fired power plants for most of its history, DEWA has recently started to add solar power to its energy mix. After installing an initial 13 MW (DC) solar plant at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in 2013, a further 200 MW (AC) were contracted from developer ACWA Power in January 2015. The latest addition to DEWA's solar portfolio will be an 800 MW solar power plant, which was in the fall of 2015 and should be completed by 2020."

DSSP's first flight was aboard the NRL SPINSAT, launched as a secondary payload on SpaceX CRS-4 and deployed from the Kibo module airlock on 28 November 2014. NASA safety experts approved the mission because the satellite's 12 thruster-clusters burn an inert solid fuel, that only ignite when an electric charge is passed across it. In July 2012, DSSP won second place in the 2012 NewSpace Business Plan Competition in Silicon Valley, sponsored by the Space Frontier Foundation."

  "text" : "Dan Gernatt Farms is a dairy farming, and horse breeding and racing enterprise, located in the Western New York town of Collins. Daniel R. Gernatt, Sr. and Flavia C. (Schmitz) Gernatt co-owned and established Dan Gernatt Farms in 1938. They built up their farming business, being recognized in the 1950s as having the largest milking dairy herd in Erie County. In the 1960s, the Gernatt's transitioned their dairy farming business to one of breeding and racing Standardbred horses with the purchase of Lieutenant Gray. Many of the Gernatt's harness racing horses had the last name, 'Collins,' reflecting the locale in which they were born. Among some of the Gernatt's top money-winning horses were Gallo Blue Chip, Bye Tsem (formerly Holden S. Collins), Vernon Blue Chip, Roz T. Collins, Adios Bob, Sir Taurus, Lotto S. Collins, and Elitist. The Gernatt's established themselves in horse breeding and harness racing throughout a period of three decades, and wound down their horse business in the mid-1990s."

  "text" : "Drakes Bay Oyster Company was an oyster farm and former restaurant located at Drakes Estero in the Point Reyes National Seashore in Northern California. The farm was originally slated to close on July 31, 2012, as its permit to operate had expired and the National Park Service has been directed to restore the area to its natural state. It was one of the largest shellfish operations in California, producing upwards of 8 million oysters a year. On July 31, the retail and restaurant operations at the company closed. Due to an injunction filed by regional restaurants, the company could continue to harvest oysters for commercial sales, until the National Park Service gave a 30-day notice for permanent closure of all operations. In early December 2014, the legal case by the restaurants and other interests was dropped, and the company terminated the oyster operation completely by the end of 2014. Environmentalists hailed the outcome, which, pending final cleanup work, will effectively return Drake's Estero to its original condition and establish the waters as a permanent wildlife sanctuary."

The Academy runs numerous medical and dental educational training programmes managed by the Doctors Academy Education and Editorial Board. The cost involved to develop and run these educational programmes is generated from the professional activities carried out by the permanent members of the Doctors Academy Group. All profit generated is then fed back into projects to reduce the cost of materials available to students and medical professionals, along with funding the academies innovative projects that are purposed to further global health. In addition, Doctors Academy offers a number of educational grants and bursaries to widen access to its courses each year. Educational activities are undertaken both independently and in conjunction with a number of organisations including the UK Royal Colleges, Universities in the United Kingdom, Hospitals and a variety of other charities and institutions. In particular courses are run with centres of excellence such as The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust  and The Royal College of Surgeons. Educational programmes have been consistently reviewed in a positive manner by numerous medical organisations and institutions based in the UK, including articles published by the BMJ, The Association of Surgeons in Training, and The Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh. Doctors, Dentists and Scientists from any part of the world are eligible for affiliate membership with the academy, subject to verification of their academic qualification or professional registration with the respective board/council. Likewise, medical and dental students may be eligible for student membership, subject to verification of their registration with a recognised university or medical/dental school."

DPT was the first company to design, manufacture and sell microprocessor-based intelligent caching disk controllers to the OEM computer market. Prior to DPT, disk caching technology had been implemented in proprietary hardware in mainframe computing to improve the speed of disk access. DPT's products popularized the use of disk caching in the 1980s. According to Bill Brothers, Unix product manager at the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), a computer operating system vendor out of California, \"The kind of performance those guys (DPT) produce is phenomenal. It's unlike any other product on the market.\" DPT was founded by Steve Goldman who served as the President and Chief Executive Officer until DPT was acquired in January 2000."

In 2012 Jane's Information Group reported the company then had ten employees, plus seven international dealers. The company builds two microlight aircraft designs, the two-seat, low-wing Alto and the two-seat, strut-braced, high-wing ArGO, which was added to the line in 2011. The Alto has been accepted by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a light-sport aircraft. The company first exhibited in the United States at the Sun 'n Fun in Lakeland, Florida, in April 2010. The company has been noted for its short wait times for aircraft ordered. By January 2015 the company had exported at least two aircraft to the U.S. since there were two Altos registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration as light-sport aircraft."

  "text" : "Davis Industries was a firearms manufacturer established in 1982 by Jim Davis. Davis produced a series of inexpensive handguns, which were sold primarily through pawn shops and marketed towards people with low income. The guns were constructed of injection-molded Zamak, a zinc alloy. Jim Davis had previously been the office manager at Raven Arms, established by George Jennings, and was also Jennings' son-in-law. As one of the companies connected to Raven Arms, and a maker of Saturday night specials, Davis was described by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as one of the Ring of Fire companies (a series of companies established around Los Angeles, California, all of which manufactured inexpensive handguns of similar design and all of which were connected to Raven Arms. Davis primarily manufactured and sold pocket pistols and derringers, in .22 LR, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP, however they also marketed some larger handguns in 9mm parabellum and .45 ACP. In 1999, Davis filed for bankruptcy and went out of business as a result of a large number of lawsuits being filed by cities and municipalities."
