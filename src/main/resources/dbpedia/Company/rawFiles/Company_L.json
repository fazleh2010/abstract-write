  "text" : "Lionhead Studios Ltd. was a British video game developer, formerly led by Peter Molyneux. It was acquired by Microsoft Studios in April 2006. Lionhead started as a breakaway from developer Bullfrog Productions, which was also founded by Molyneux. Lionhead's first game was Black & White, a god game with elements of artificial life and strategy games. Black & White was published by Electronic Arts in 2001. Lionhead Studios is named after Mark Webley's hamster, which died not long after the naming of the studio. Black and White was followed up with the release of an expansion pack named Black & White: Creature Isle. Lionhead then released the popular Fable, from satellite developer Big Blue Box. In 2005, Lionhead released The Movies and Black & White 2. On 6 April 2006, it was announced that Lionhead Studios was to be purchased by Microsoft. Their most recent game to be released is the HD remake of Fable, Fable Anniversary, which was released on 4 February 2014. Milo and Kate was being developed for Kinect, though speculation arose concerning whether it was actually a game or a tech demo. Production has since been halted. On 7 March 2016, Microsoft announced that it had proposed closing Lionhead Studios and that the planned game Fable Legends would be cancelled. On 29 April 2016, Lionhead Studios officially closed down."

LucasArts is best known for its graphic adventure games, as well as games based on the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises. Its headquarters are located in San Francisco, California. It was founded in May 1982 by George Lucas as Lucasfilm Games, the video game development group of his film company, Lucasfilm. Lucas initially served as the company's chairman. During a 1990 reorganization of Lucas companies, the Lucasfilm Games division was renamed LucasArts. LucasArts was acquired by The Walt Disney Company through the acquisition of its parent company Lucasfilm in 2012. On April 3, 2013, Disney halted all internal development at LucasArts and laid off most of its staff. However, LucasArts remained open so that it could retain its function as a licensor. Development of games based on the Star Wars license will be performed by Electronic Arts, through an exclusive license, for the core gaming market. Disney Interactive Studios retained the ability to develop, and LucasArts retained the ability to license the franchise for the casual gaming market. Development of video games based upon other Lucasfilm properties will now be assumed by Disney Interactive Studios or licensed to third parties."

  "text" : "Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian: [lamborˈɡiːni] ) is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi. Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent. Lamborghini produces sports cars and V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán."

  "text" : "Lexus (レクサス Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Toyota. The Lexus marque is marketed in over 70 countries and territories worldwide, has become Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars, and has ranked among the ten largest Japanese global brands in market value. Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and the U.S. in Torrance, California. Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible, and SUV models. Until 2005 Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989-2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted, and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. In 2007, Lexus launched its own F marque performance division with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009. From the start of production, Lexus vehicles have been produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka, Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus built outside the country, the Ontario, Canada–produced RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus operates its own design, engineering, and manufacturing centers. Since the 2000s (decade), Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market, the United States. The division inaugurated dealerships in Japan's domestic market in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin. The brand was introduced in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, and other regions. The division's lineup also reflects regional differences for model and powertrain configurations."

The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998 among 16 financial institutions — which included Bankers Trust, Barclays, Bear Stearns, Chase Manhattan Bank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Paribas, Salomon Smith Barney, Societe Generale, and UBS — for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. LTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a \"new method to determine the value of derivatives\". Initially successful with annualized return of over 21% (after fees) in its first year, 43% in the second year and 41% in the third year, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months following the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 1998 Russian financial crisis requiring financial intervention by the Federal Reserve, with the fund liquidating and dissolving in early 2000."

It developed into a brand encompassing a range of four-wheel-drive models, including the Defender, Discovery, Freelander, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque. Land Rovers are currently assembled in the company's Halewood and Solihull plants, with research and development taking place at the Gaydon and Whitley engineering centres. Land Rover sold 194,000 vehicles worldwide in 2009. In September 2013 Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to open a 100 million GBP (160 million USD) research and development centre in the University of Warwick, Coventry to create a next generation of vehicle technologies. The carmaker said around 1,000 academics and engineers would work there and that construction would start in 2014."

  "text" : "Lloyd's of London, generally known simply as Lloyd's, is an insurance market located in London's primary financial district, the City of London. Unlike most of its competitors in the industry, it is not an insurance company. It is a corporate body governed by the Lloyd's Act of 1871 and subsequent Acts of Parliament. It is a partially mutualised marketplace within which multiple financial backers, grouped in syndicates, come together to pool and spread risk. These underwriters, or \"members\", are a collection of both corporations and private individuals, the latter being traditionally known as \"Names\". The insurance business underwritten at Lloyd's is predominantly general insurance and reinsurance, although a small number of syndicates write term life assurance. The market has its roots in marine insurance and was founded by Edward Lloyd at his coffee house on Tower Street in around 1688. Today, it has a dedicated building on Lime Street, opened in 1986. Its motto is Fidentia, Latin for \"confidence\", and it is closely associated with the Latin phrase uberrima fides, or \"utmost good faith\". In 2015, there were 84 syndicates that wrote £26.69 billion of gross premiums on business placed by 242 Lloyd's brokers. Insurance lines comprised 68% of the business written, mainly property and casualty (liability), while reinsurance represented 32%. Collectively the market reported a pre-tax profit of £2.12 billion, down from £3.16 billion in 2014."

  "text" : "The London Company (also called the Charter of the Virginia Company of London) was an English joint stock company established in 1606 by royal charter by King James I with the purpose of establishing colonial settlements in North America. The territory granted to the London Company included the coast of North America from the 34th parallel (Cape Fear) north to the 41st parallel (in Long Island Sound). As part of the Virginia Company and Colony, the London Company \"owned\" a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. The company was permitted by its charter to establish a 100-square-mile (260 km2) settlement within this area. The portion of the company's territory north of the 38th parallel was shared with the Plymouth Company, with the stipulation that neither company found a colony within 100 miles (161 km) of each other. The London Company made landfall on April 26, 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, which they named Cape Henry, near present-day Virginia Beach. Deciding to move the encampment, on May 4, 1607, they established the Jamestown Settlement on the James River about 40 miles (64 km) upstream from its mouth at the Chesapeake Bay. Later in 1607, the Plymouth Company established its Popham Colony in present-day Maine, but it was abandoned after about a year. By 1609, the Plymouth Company had dissolved. As a result, the charter for the London Company was adjusted with a new grant that extended from \"sea to sea\" of the previously-shared area between the 38th and 40th parallel. It was amended in 1612 to include the new territory of the Somers Isles (or Bermuda). The London Company struggled financially, especially with labor shortages in its Virginia colony. Its profits improved after sweeter strains of tobacco than the native variety were cultivated and successfully exported from Virginia as a cash crop beginning in 1612. By 1619 a system of indentured service was fully developed in the colony; the same year the home government passed a law that prohibited the commercial growing of tobacco in England. In 1624, the company lost its charter, and Virginia became a royal colony. (Its spin-off, The London Company of The Somers Isles, operated until 1684)."

The company manufactured affordable, small steam cars until 1903, then production switched entirely to internal combustion-powered luxury automobiles. Locomobile was taken over in 1922 by Durant Motors and eventually went out of business in 1929. All cars ever produced by the original company were always sold under the brand name Locomobile."

  "text" : "Lift Engineering, more commonly known as Yan Lifts, was a major ski lift manufacturer in North America. Founded in 1965 and based in Carson City, Nevada, the firm came under scrutiny by state safety officials after a fatal accident in 1985, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 1996. The company built at least 200 fixed-grip chairlifts, as well as 31 high-speed quads, while becoming one of the most successful yet controversial lift firms in the ski industry. The company's high speed quads have been involved in the deaths of five people and the injury of 70, the worst record of any ski-lift maker operating in North America. Yan fixed-grip chairlifts however, continue to have an excellent reputation. After a series of accidents, Yan Lifts were outlawed in certain states including California and Colorado. The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996. Eventually, Yan Lifts manufactured new track and cables for the Angels Flight funicular, but the company, now called YanTrak, went out of business in 2001 after a major accident."

Kughn forming Lionel Trains, Inc. in 1986. The Martin Davis Investment Group (Wellspring) bought Lionel Trains, Inc. in 1995 and renamed it Lionel LLC. Although Lionel, LLC now owns all of the trademarks and most of the product rights associated with Lionel Corporation, the original producer of Lionel trains founded in 1900, there is no direct connection between the two companies. According to its reorganization papers filed as part of its bankruptcy plan on May 21, 2007, about 95% of the company's sales come from O gauge trains. The plan estimated that about US$70 million worth of O gauge trains are sold each year, and that Lionel accounts for about 60% of that market, making it the largest manufacturer of O gauge trains."

  "text" : "Legend Entertainment was an American developer of computer games, best known for their complex, distinctive adventure titles throughout the 1990s. The company was founded in 1989 by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu after the end of Infocom. Their goal was to design interactive fiction in the Infocom tradition. Legend's first products were all illustrated text adventures, some of them designed by Infocom veteran Steve Meretzky. Starting in 1993, they switched to a new development system for graphic-only adventures. Several of their adventure games were based on book licenses, including Frederik Pohl's Gateway, Terry Brooks' Shannara, Spider Robinson's Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, Piers Anthony's Xanth, and Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's The Death Gate Cycle. The company was acquired by GT Interactive in 1998 and began changing their focus to action games. They developed a first-person shooter based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time and finished the development of the second part in the Unreal series in 2002. Late in 2003, they released a free expansion for Unreal II: The Awakening, known as XMP (eXpanded MultiPlayer). In 1999, GT Interactive was purchased outright by Infogrames, who later acquired and rebranded themselves as Atari. On Friday, January 16, 2004, Legend Entertainment was shut down. A brief press release from Atari cites that it was \"purely a business decision\", and that \"Legend had recently completed its only current project and had no new projects in the pipeline.\""

Sloan created LaSalle as a companion marque for Cadillac. LaSalle automobiles were manufactured by Cadillac, but were priced lower than Cadillac-branded automobiles and were marketed as the second-most prestigious marque in the General Motors portfolio. Like Cadillac, the LaSalle brand name was based on that of a French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle."

  "text" : "The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is a Crown corporation that retails and distributes alcoholic beverages throughout the province of Ontario, Canada. It is accountable to the Ontario Ministry of Finance. It was established in 1927 on the advice of Ontario Premier Howard Ferguson, to sell liquor, wine, and beer. Such sales had been banned outright in 1916; thus, the creation of the LCBO marked an easing of the province's temperance regime (see Prohibition in Canada). The LCBO maintains a \"quasi-monopoly\" on alcoholic beverage sales in Ontario — Canada's most populous province with over 13 million people, or almost 40% of the nation's population — and as a result is one of the world's largest purchasers of alcoholic beverages. LCBO stores are the only retail outlets licensed to sell alcohol in Ontario, with a few notable exceptions: beer is also sold by The Beer Store (which has a monopoly on retailing 12- and 24-bottle cases of beer), and a number of local wine, beer and alcohol producers are licensed to sell their own brands outside the purview of LCBO stores. Many of these outlets are located at the wineries, breweries or distilleries themselves; others are located within grocery stores. The LCBO has plans to also open its own outlets within some grocery stores. The LCBO is also the chief supplier of alcoholic beverages to bars and restaurants in Ontario, which are generally required by law to purchase their alcoholic products through the LCBO, The Beer Store, or directly from Ontario wineries and breweries. Beverages sold at bars and restaurants must be consumed on the establishments' premises. As of July 11, 2016, LCBO accepts Apple Pay in each of their 651 stores in the province, allowing contactless payment for all purchases of liquor."

  "text" : "Lola Cars International Ltd. was a racing car engineering company founded in 1958 by Eric Broadley and based in Huntingdon, England. Enduring more than fifty years, it was one of the oldest and largest manufacturers of racing cars in the world. Lola Cars started by building small front-engined sports cars, and branched out into Formula Junior cars before diversifying into a wider range of sporting vehicles. Lola was acquired by Martin Birrane in 1998 after the unsuccessful MasterCard Lola attempt at Formula One. Lola Cars was a brand of the Lola Group, which combined former rowing boat manufacturer Lola Aylings and Lola Composites, that specialized in carbon fibre production. After a period in bankruptcy administration, Lola Cars International ceased trading on 5 October 2012. Many of Lola's assets were subsequently purchased by a partnership composed of Multimatic Engineering and the Carl A. Haas Automotive company."

  "text" : "Lloyds Bank plc is a British retail and commercial bank with branches across England and Wales. It has traditionally been considered one of the \"Big Four\" clearing banks. Originally founded in Birmingham in 1765, the bank expanded during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and took over a number of smaller banking companies. In 1995 it merged with the Trustee Savings Bank and traded as \"Lloyds TSB Bank plc\" between 1999 and 2013. The bank is the principal subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group, which was formed in January 2009 by the acquisition of HBOS by the then-Lloyds TSB Group. That year, following the UK bank rescue package, the British Government took a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. As a condition imposed by the European Commission regarding state aid, the group later announced that it would create a new standalone retail banking business, made up of a number of Lloyds TSB branches and those of Cheltenham & Gloucester. The new business began operations on 9 September 2013 under the TSB brand. Lloyds TSB was subsequently renamed Lloyds Bank on 23 September 2013. Lloyds Bank is the largest retail bank in Britain, and has an extensive network of branches and ATM in England and Wales (as well as an arrangement for its customers to be serviced by Bank of Scotland branches in Scotland, Halifax branches in Northern Ireland and vice versa) and offers 24-hour telephone and online banking services. As of 2012 it has 16 million personal customers and small business accounts. Lloyds Bank came 10th out of 12 in the British Bank Awards 2016 It has its operational Headquarters in London with other offices in Wales and Scotland. It also operates a number of office complex, brand headquarters and data centres in Yorkshire including Leeds, Sheffield and Halifax."

  "text" : "Linn Products is an engineering company that manufactures hi-fi and audio equipment. Founded by Ivor Tiefenbrun in Glasgow, Scotland in 1973, the company is best known as the manufacturer of the iconic Linn Sondek LP12 turntable. From 2007 Linn was one of the first audio manufacturers to introduce digital music streaming using the home network and internet. This has become the focus of the company’s strategy leading to audio systems to support digital music playback of 24bit/192 kHz studio master quality recordings using a digital stream over a home network. Linn Records was the first to sell DRM-free 24-bit Studio Master quality tracks downloaded over the internet. This network approach was extended in 2013 with the introduction of the Linn Exakt technology to retain the 24-bit lossless signal in the digital domain to the active crossover. In late 2014 Linn announced the integration of TIDAL’s lossless music streaming service (Tidal (service)) into Linn DS digital players enabling access to over 25 million audio tracks at CD-quality over the Internet. Originally based in the eponymous suburb of Linn, south Glasgow, and opposite Linn Park, it is now based just outside the city, between Waterfoot and Eaglesham, East Renfrewshire."

Lionel trains, produced from 1900 to 1969, drew admiration from model railroaders around the world for the solidity of their construction and the authenticity of their detail. During its peak years in the 1950s, the company sold $25 million worth of trains per year. In 2006, Lionel's electric train, along with the Easy-Bake Oven, became the first electric toy inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. Lionel remains the most enduring brand name associated with model trains in the United States, its products prized by collectors. Today, Lionel, LLC owns all of the trademarks and most of the product rights associated with the Lionel Corporation; there is, however, no direct connection between the two companies."

  "text" : "Leaf is a Japanese visual novel studio under the publisher Aquaplus, and has offices in Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, and Tokyo. It and its competitor Key (to which it is often compared) are two of the most popular and successful dedicated visual novel studios operating today. It was launched out of obscurity by its early release To Heart. Leaf used the XviD video codec in several games: Aruru to Asobo!!, Tears to Tiara, Kusari, and ToHeart2 X Rated. Since XviD is free software, released under the GPL, Leaf was forced to release the source code to those games under the same license. One still required the game data to actually play the games with the source code. In addition, a free software engine called xlvns was developed soon after Leaf released its first three visual novels. Characters from Utawarerumono, Tears to Tiara, To Heart, and Kizuato are playable in Aquapazza: Aquaplus Dream Match, a fighting game developed by Aquaplus featuring characters from various Leaf games."

  "text" : "LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, better known as LVMH, is a European multinational luxury goods conglomerate, native of France and headquartered in Paris. The company was formed by the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with Moet Hennessy, a company formed after the 1971 merger between the champagne producer Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, the cognac manufacturer. It controls around 60 subsidiaries that each manage a small number of prestigious brands. The subsidiaries are often managed independently. The oldest of the LVMH brands is wine producer Château d'Yquem, which dates its origins back to 1593. Christian Dior, the luxury goods group, is the main holding company of LVMH, owning 40.9% of its shares, and 59.01% of its voting rights. Bernard Arnault, majority shareholder of Dior, is Chairman of both companies and CEO of LVMH. Arnault's successful integration of various famous aspirational brands into the group has inspired other luxury companies into doing the same. Thus, the French conglomerate Kering (formerly named PPR) and the Swiss-based Richemont have also created extended portfolios of luxury brands. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index."

  "text" : "Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (former NYSE ticker symbol LEH) /ˈliːmən/ was a global financial services firm. Before declaring bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), doing business in investment banking, equity and fixed-income sales and trading (especially U.S. Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008. On September 15, 2008, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the massive exodus of most of its clients, drastic losses in its stock, and devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies, largely sparked by Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent allegations of negligence and malfeasance. Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the late-2000s global financial crisis. The following day, Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions along with its New York headquarters building. On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck. The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. The deal became effective on October 13, 2008."

  "text" : "Lloyd's Register Group Limited (LR) is a technical and business services organisation and a maritime classification society, wholly owned by the Lloyd’s Register Foundation, a UK charity dedicated to research and education in science and engineering. The organisation dates back to 1760. Its stated aims are to enhance the safety of life, property, and the environment, by helping its clients (including by validation, certification and accreditation) to ensure the quality construction, and operation, of critical infrastructure. Historically, as Lloyd's Register of Shipping, it was a specifically maritime organisation. During the late 20th century, it diversified into other industries including oil and gas, process industries, nuclear, and rail. Through its 100% subsidiary Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance Ltd (LRQA), it is also a major vendor of independent assessment services, including management systems certification for quality certification to ISO9001, ISO14001 and OSHAS18001. Lloyd's Register is unaffiliated with Lloyd's of London. In July 2012, the organisation converted from an industrial and provident society to a company limited by shares, named Lloyd’s Register Group Limited, with the new Lloyd’s Register Foundation as the sole shareholder. At the same time the organisation gifted to the Foundation a substantial bond and equity portfolio to assist it with its charitable purposes and it will benefit from continued funding from the group’s operating arm, Lloyd’s Register Group Limited."

  "text" : "Lenzing AG is a company based in Lenzing, Austria, whose main business is textile and nonwovens cellulose fibers (such as modal and lyocell) and also makes some polymer plastics. Lenzing Group is an international group of companies with its headquarters in Austria, and production sites in all major markets. The company initially focused solely on fiber production, but it needed plastic wrappings for its fiber bales, so Lenzing Plastics was founded to produce them. The plastics division is still active, making 11.7% of total sales in 2009. The company's history goes back to 1892 when Emil Hamburger, an industrialist, operated a paper mill in Lenzing, Austria. In 1938 Zellwolle Lenzing AG was founded, starting pulp and viscose fiber production and in 1962 the company's name was changed to Chemiefaser Lenzing AG. The old calcium bisulphite method was used for fiber production until 1963, when the new more eco-friendly magnesium bisulphite method was introduced. In 1975 the company established a department responsible for the environment and introduced a more \"green\" bleaching process for pulp in 1977. In 1984 the company name changed to Lenzing AG and its shares were listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in 1986. Lenzing Group has international branch offices in the United States and Asia (China, India, Indonesia). Its production facilities are located mainly within the European Union, with the fibers being produced in Austria, United Kingdom, the US, China, and Indonesia, while its plastics factories are located in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and the US. The pulp is produced in the Czech Republic and the engineering research is done in Lenzing, Austria which is also the largest integrated pulp and viscose fiber production site worldwide. Total 2009 sales were EUR 1.25 billion, with a workforce of 6,021. The main fiber markets of Lenzing are Asia (52%) and Europe (39%). The majority owner of Lenzing, with 90.15% of voting rights, is B & C Industrieholding GmbH along with its subsidiaries. As of 2007, the corporate group has an annual production of over 500,000 tons of fibers, over 27,000 tons of plastics, and over 80,000 tons of paper. The paper division was sold out in 2008. In April 2015, Lenzing sold its German subsidiary Dolan, along with Kelheim and a 91-percent stake in European Carbon Fiber GmbH to WHEB Partners' Growth Fund 2 and Jan Verdenhalven. The sale price remains confidential."

Loompanics was in business for nearly 30 years. The publisher and editor was Michael Hoy. Mike Hoy started Loompanics Unlimited in East Lansing, Michigan, in 1975. He later moved the business to Port Townsend, Washington, where his friend and fellow publisher R.W. Bradford had earlier located. In January 2006, Loompanics announced that it was going out of business, and that it was selling off its inventory. In the spring of 2006, Paladin Press announced that it acquired the rights to 40 titles previously published or sold by Loompanics, including the works of Claire Wolfe, Eddie the Wire, and other popular Loompanics authors."

  "text" : "Lunn Poly was, at one time, the largest chain of travel agents in the United Kingdom. The company originated from two successful travel agencies established in the 1890s: The Polytechnic Touring Association and Sir Henry Lunn Travel. Both firms were acquired in the 1950s by the British Eagle airline group, and combined into Lunn Poly during 1965. It became a nationalised industry as part of the Transport Holding Company (THC). In June 1971, Sunair bought Lunn Poly from the THC for £175,000. The next year, the company became part of Thomson Travel Group, along the way it acquired ten John Camkin Travel shops in the Midlands – which increased the number of shops from less than 30 to nearly 500 by 1990. It is now owned by TUI Northern Europe, a subsidiary of the German conglomerate TUI AG. When TUI UK rebranded Britannia Airways as Thomsonfly in November 2003, the company insisted that there were no plans to rebrand Lunn Poly. On 2 November 2004, however, the announcement was made that Lunn Poly was to be rebranded as Thomson in order to create a \"powerbrand\". TUI UK announced that all 780 Lunn Poly shops in the United Kingdom would be renamed to Thomson before the peak holiday booking period started on 26 December 2004. Lunn Poly was famous for a long-running advertising campaign on television. These commercials featured people looking into what holidays the company offered. Another person would then say to them in disbelief \"Lunn Poly? Get away!\", at which point the person would disappear into thin air and end up at a vacation spot."

Established in 1999, Lion Air has seen tremendous growth in the past several years, having acquired over 100 aircraft with nearly 500 more on order. The airline has repeatedly broken records for largest aircraft orders, such as its $24 billion order for 234 Airbus A320 jets, as well as its $22.4 billion order for 230 competing aircraft from Boeing. It had once been criticized for poor operational management in areas such as scheduling and safety, although steps have been taken to improve its safety: on June 16, 2016, the European Union lifted the ban it had placed on Lion Air from flying into European airspace. Lion Air operates over 100 Boeing 737-800/900ER aircraft. The airline has been characterised by its rapid expansion and the success of its low-cost business model. The airline holds minority shareholdings in associate companies based in Thailand (Thai Lion Air) and Malaysia (Malindo Air)."

  "text" : "LIVE365 was an Internet radio broadcasting and listening network where users were able to create their own online radio stations, or choose to listen to thousands of human curated stations created by people from around the globe. LIVE365 was unique in that online radio stations on the LIVE365 network were created and managed by music and talk enthusiasts, including both hobbyists and professional broadcasters. LIVE365 also had many well established AM and FM stations that utilized the LIVE365 broadcasting platform to simulcast their terrestrial radio streams via the Live365 distribution network. The Live365 network also featured radio stations from well-known artists such as Johnny Cash, David Byrne, Pat Metheny, Jethro Tull, Frank Zappa, and more. LIVE365 was created in 1999, and remained one of the longest running internet radio websites for listeners and broadcasters. With the pending expiration of the lower royalty rate allowed for small broadcasters, investors removed their support of the company. In late December, 2015, LIVE365 laid off most of its employees and vacated its office, and the few remaining employees were working from home. On January 31, 2016 LIVE365 ceased webcasting. LIVE365's website now redirects listeners and users to a list of competing services. The shutdown of LIVE365 also affected terrestrial AM and FM stations that used LIVE365, causing them to disperse to other live streams."

  "text" : "Land Bank of the Philippines (Filipino: Bangko sa Lupa ng Pilipinas, Spanish: Banco Hipotecario de Filipinas), stylized as LANDBANK or also known by its initials, LBP, is a universal bank in the Philippines owned by the Philippine government with a special focus on serving the needs of farmers and fishermen. While it provides the services of a universal bank, it is officially classified as a \"specialized government bank\" with a universal banking license. Landbank is the third largest bank in the Philippines in terms of assets and is the largest government-owned bank. It is also one of the biggest government owned and controlled corporations in the Philippines. Unlike most Philippine banks, Land Bank has an extensive rural branch network with 347 branches and 1328 ATMs. It services many rural sector clients in areas where banking is either limited to rural banks or is non-existent. In 2015, it was planned to merged with DBP but it had not pushed through. One year later, on February 4, 2016, President Benigno Aquino III approved the Executive Order #198 on the merger between Land Bank and the DBP, with the former as the surviving entity."

  "text" : "The Lake Champlain Transportation Company (LCTC or just LCT) provides car and passenger ferry service at three points on Lake Champlain in the United States. From 1976 to 2003, it was owned by Burlington, Vermont, businessman Raymond C. Pecor, Jr. who is Chairman of the company's board. In 2003, he sold the company to his son, Raymond Pecor III. Lake Champlain is the thirteenth-largest lake in the United States, reaching a maximum width of 12 miles (19 km) and depths of more than 300 feet (91 m). As such, there is no bridging of the \"broad lake\" north of Crown Point, New York, and south of the Rouses Point-Alburg-Swanton crossing near the Canada border, though bridging of the lake near Plattsburgh has been proposed. The ferry service allows convenient transport across the lake between New York and Vermont. Approximately one million passengers cross the lake by ferry each year."

  "text" : "The Lake Torpedo Boat Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut was an early builder of submarines for the United States Navy. Founded by Simon Lake in 1912, the firm competed with the Electric Boat Company until financial difficulties led to the company's demise in 1924. The Navy ceased awarding contracts to Lake shortly before that time, partly because USS S-2 (SS-106), the company's entry in the S-class submarine design competition, was not selected for further production. Only five S-boats were built by Lake. Also, the yard was not physically able to build the large submarine cruisers then envisioned, such as USS Argonaut (SM-1). The Washington Naval Treaty's limits on submarines were also a major factor. At the time, the Navy wished to concentrate submarine construction at Navy Yards, particularly Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. The company completed 26 submarines for the US Navy, designed two US Navy submarines that were built in other yards, and built several other submarines for civilian use or that were not accepted by the Navy. Some of the submarines built by Lake for the Navy included several G-class, L-class, O-class, and R-class submarines. The company designed the Imperial Russian Navy's Osetr-class submarines, the first of which was Lake's Protector. The Kaiman-class submarines were also designed for Russia."

  "text" : "Logic Programming Associates (LPA) is a company specializing in logic programming and artificial intelligence software. LPA was founded in 1980 and is widely known for its range of Prolog compilers and more recently for VisiRule. LPA was established to exploit research at Imperial College, London into logic programming carried out under the supervision of Prof Robert Kowalski. One of the first implementations made available by LPA was micro-PROLOG which ran on popular 8-bit home computers such as the Sinclair Spectrum and Apple II. This was followed by micro-PROLOG Professional one of the first Prolog implementations for MS-DOS. As well as continue with Prolog compiler technology development, LPA has a track record of creating innovative associated tools and products to address specific challenges and opportunities. In 1989, LPA developed the Flex expert system toolkit, which incorporated frame-based reasoning with inheritance, rule-based programming and data-driven procedures. Flex has its own English-like Knowledge Specification Language (KSL) which means that knowledge and rules are defined in an easy-to-read and understand way. In 1992, LPA helped set up the Prolog Vendors Group, a not-for-profit organization whose aim was to help promote Prolog by making people aware of its usage in industry. In 2000, LPA helped set up Business Integrity, now a leading supplier of document assembly and contract creation software solutons for the legal market. LPA's core product is LPA Prolog for Windows, a compiler and development system for the Microsoft Windows platform. The current LPA software range comprises an integrated AI toolset which covers various aspects of Artificial Intelligence including Logic Programming, Expert Systems, Knowledge-based Systems, Data Mining, Agents and Case-based reasoning etc. In 2004, LPA launched VisiRule  a graphical tool for developing knowledge-based and decision support systems. VisiRule has been used in various sectors, to build legal expert systems, machine diagnostic programs, medical and financial advice systems, etc."

  "text" : "Long Island Power Authority, commonly abbreviated as LIPA (\"lie-pah\"), is a municipal subdivision of the State of New York that oversees PSEG Long Island, the electricity service provider for most of Long Island. LIPA was originally created under the Long Island Power Act of 1985 to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)'s assets and securities after the cancellation of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant. A second Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), a wholly owned subsidiary of the first, acquired LILCO's transmission and distribution system in May 1998. LIPA currently is responsible for the oversight and ownership of the former LILCO electric grid on Long Island now branded, operated and managed by a division of PSEG since January 1, 2014. Before that point, LIPA had played a significant role in day-to-day operations and the system was run under its brand name, though National Grid USA (previously Keyspan Energy) maintained its transmission and distribution system under a management services agreement that expired on December 31, 2013. LIPA's Long Island retail electric system provides electric service to over 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. PSEG and LIPA do not own or operate any electric generation or retail natural gas assets on Long Island. LIPA's Long Island transmission voltages are 345,000, 138,000 and 69,000 volts, subtransmission voltages are 33,000 and 23,000 volts, and distribution voltages are 13,200 and 4,160 volts. On January 24, 2007, then-Governor Eliot Spitzer announced that Kevin Law would replace Richard Kessel as Chairman of LIPA until the fall when a new Chairman would be named and Law would become Chief Executive Officer of LIPA. On October 8, 2007, Law took over as President and CEO. Kevin Law stepped down on September 1, 2010 in order to become the new President of the Long Island Association. Chief Operating Officer Michael Hervey assumed the responsibilities until a new CEO and President is selected by the LIPA Board of Trustees. David M. Daly is the current President and COO of PSEG Long Island, while Ralph V. Suozzi is the chairman of LIPA's Board of Trustees. LIPA and National Grid caught much media criticism in their response to Hurricane Sandy. As a result of criticism in the response to Sandy, numerous key people at LIPA have resigned. Michael Hervey, COO of LIPA, resigned on November 13, 2012 for this very reason. Though it has not been officially confirmed whether these resignations were caused by the response to Sandy, Bruce Germano (VP of Customer Service) and X. Cristofer Damianos (Member of the Board of Trustees) resigned on November 27, 2012, and most importantly, LIPA chairman Howard Steinberg also resigned on November 30, 2012."

Previously a swamp area, it was opened in 1993 and is today a benchmark for Indonesia's \"other\" urban developments. PT. Lippo Karawaci Tbk. was first established as PT. Tunggal Reksakencana in 1990, as a subsidiary of Lippo Group, to build the Lippo Village (then Lippo Karawaci) township in Tangerang. As well as Lippo Karawaci, the Lippo Group has also developed the Lippo Cikarang township in Cikarang, east of Jakarta. Known for its clean environment and excellent infrastructure, Lippo Karawaci consist of three main residential areas and a commercial district. Supermal Karawaci (previously Lippo Supermal), located at the heart of the commercial district, was the largest shopping centre in west of Jakarta when it opened in 1996. The township itself has a direct highway exit and scheduled in-town (and inter-town) buses. Next to Supermal Karawaci, is the area of Benton Junction. This area of sidewalk restaurants, coffee shops, small boutiques and tree-lined streets has a feel reminiscent of a European Village. Across from Benton Junction is a large Times Bookstore, one of Indonesia's largest English-language bookstores. Sekolah Pelita Harapan (SPH), Sekolah Dian Harapan (SDH) and University of Pelita Harapan (UPH), all part of Yayasan Pelita Harapan were founded (and are located) in Lippo Karawaci. The township also hosts Siloam Hospital (previously Siloam Gleneagles Hospital), a four star Imperial Aryaduta Hotel and a championship Imperial Golf Club. The apartment complex Amartapura, which is located in the township, consist of a 50 story and 40 story tower. Most Lippo companies are headquartered in Lippo Karawaci including AIG Life, Matahari Department Store and Supermarket, Multipolar Corporation, Lippo Bank, Kabelvision and Lippo General Insurance. The area is also home to many businesses run by Korean expatriates in Indonesia. The temporary Jakarta Street Circuit in Karawaci was confirmed to host the fifth round of the 2008-09 A1 Grand Prix season, set for the weekend of 8 February 2009 to showcase the village and the surrounding businesses. The track designed by Hermann Tilke and part of the University of Pelita Harapan’s planned extensions will be utilized to double the pit lane capacity during the A1GP races."

  "text" : "L. S. Ayres and Company was an Indianapolis, Indiana, department store founded in 1872 by Lyman S. Ayres. Over the years its Indianapolis flagship store, which opened in 1905 and was later enlarged, became known for its women’s fashions, the Tea Room, holiday events and displays, and the basement budget store. As urban populations shifted to the suburbs, Ayres established branch stores in new shopping centers in several Indiana cities. Ayres also acquired retail subsidiaries in Springfield, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Louisville, Kentucky. Ayr-Way, the Ayres discount store subsidiary, became one of the first discount store divisions launched by a traditional store. By the end of the 1960s Ayres had become a diversified merchandising business with retail department stores, a chain of discount stores, specialty clothing stores, a home furnishings showroom, and a real estate holding company. A long-time Ayres slogan, \"That Ayres Look\", promoted the company as a fashion leader and by 1972 it had become the oldest continuous retail slogan in the United States. Associated Dry Goods acquired Ayres in 1972. After The May Company acquired Associated Dry Goods in 1986, several Ayres stores were closed. The flagship store in Indianapolis was closed in the spring of 1992 as the remaining Ayres operation merged with May's Famous-Barr division. Federated Department Stores, owner of rival Macy's, acquired The May Company on August 30, 2005. On February 1, 2006, L. S. Ayres was dissolved and folded into the newly-formed Macy's Midwest division. On September 9, 2006, the L. S. Ayres name was retired as most stores were converted to Macy's. The former downtown Indianapolis flagship location today houses a Carson's store."

Acquired by Amazon.com in 2011, the service had reached 2 million subscribers. It also claimed over 70,000 titles, and over 4 million DVD, Blu-ray or game rentals per month in five countries. Through a series of acquisitions, Lovefilm quickly became the leading online DVD rental and streaming outlet in the UK and Europe. The company offered a download service alongside postal delivery but this ceased on 23 February 2009. The company has started a \"watch online\" service which offers over 4,700 films available to watch as part of a subscription. This online viewing is available free for subscribers who have opted for one of their unlimited monthly rental plans or the unlimited streaming-only account. In February 2014, Amazon announced that it would fold Lovefilm's streaming service into its Instant Video service on 26 February 2014. Lovefilm's DVD rental service continues to be available in both Germany and the United Kingdom under the Lovefilm brand from Amazon's local websites."

Its winged hourglass logo is the oldest registered trademark for a watchmaker. Longines is known for its \"Aviators\" range of watches. A company director was a friend of Charles Lindbergh; after his transatlantic flight, Lindbergh designed a pilot watch to help with air navigation. Built to his specifications, it is still produced today. Longines provided timers used at the first modern Olympics in 1896. In 1899, a Longines watch went to the North Pole with Arctic explorer Luigi Amedeo of Savoy. It was the first to use automatic timekeeping for the Federal Gymnastics at Basel in 1912. Today, Longines sells sport watches and chronographs."

Several stores in the chain were bought in 1991 by the company Owen Owen and continued to operate under the Lewis's brand name for several years, but after the closure of the Manchester store in 2002, only the original Liverpool store continued to trade under the Lewis's name. This store was sold in 2007 to the Vergo Retail Ltd and closed in 2010."

Services were provided up to ten times per day. However, slow speeds caused by curvy infrastructure in Norway, combined with competition from low-cost airlines, caused the company to lose money, and eventually grounded operations. The services were taken over by NSB and SJ. Linx. The main rolling stock were eleven X2 electric multiple units, although it used Rc-hauled trains on the Gothenburg–Oslo service.

Lexar was created by Petro Estakhri and Mike Assar. In 2005, Lexar was awarded $380 million in a lawsuit against Toshiba who copied Lexar's flash memory technology. Lexar was acquired by Micron Technology in 2006, and subsequently merged with Crucial Technology under the name Lexar Media, a subsidiary of Micron. In September 2007, Lexar extended its agreement with Eastman Kodak Company to develop and market Kodak-branded flash memory products worldwide. The Lexar JumpDrive trademark was often used synonymously with the term USB flash drives when the technology was first adopted."

LRT has provided regular radio service since 1926 and television broadcasting since 1957. LRT currently employs about 650 people. LRT was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on 1 January 1993. The Lithuanian Radio and Television Council oversees the operations of LRT according to the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public and the Lithuanian Radio and Television Law. LRT is funded by the state budget (about 75%) and television commercials. A television licence fee or tax that every television purchaser would have to pay is being discussed since 1996 as the future source of income for LRT. In May 2007 LRT started a project of converting all of its films, including some five thousand hours of cinefilm and some 30,000 hours of video tapes to digital. The oldest entry dates back to 1895. On 23 December 2013 Seimas banned commercials on LRT TV channels and radio stations starting from 2015."

  "text" : "Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids or potential artificial life as living. Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. The definition of life is controversial. The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. However, many other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are also some borderline cases, such as viruses. Biophysicists have also proposed some definitions, many being based on chemical systems. There are also some living systems theories, such as the Gaia hypothesis, the idea that the Earth is alive; the former first developed by James Grier Miller. Another one is that life is the property of ecological systems, and yet another is the complex systems biology, a branch or subfield of mathematical biology. Some other systemic definitions includes the theory involving the darwinian dynamic, and the operator theory. However, throughout history, there have been many other theories and definitions about life such as materialism, the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it; hylomorphism, the belief that all things are a combination of matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its soul; spontaneous generation, the belief that life repeatedly emerge from non-life; and vitalism, a discredited scientific hypothesis that living organisms possess a \"life force\" or \"vital spark\". Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Life on Earth arose 3.8–4.1 billion years ago. It is widely accepted that current life on Earth descended from an RNA world, but RNA based life may not have been the first. The mechanism by which life began on Earth is unknown, although many hypotheses have been formulated, most based on the Miller–Urey experiment. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth. Since appearing, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale. To survive in most ecosystems, life can adapt and thrive in a wide range of conditions. Some organisms, called extremophiles, can thrive in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. Properties common to all organisms are the need for certain core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning. Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms. Later, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. Fungi was later classified as its own kingdom. Eventually new groups of life were revealed, such as cells and microorganisms, and even non-cellular reproducing agents, such as viruses and viroids. Cells are the smallest units of life, often called the \"building blocks of life\". There are two kind of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell division in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Though only known on Earth, many believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life. Artificial life is a computer simulation of any aspect of life, which is used to examine systems related to life. Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. Extinction is the process by which a group of taxa, normally a species, dies out. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms."

  "text" : "Brussels is considered the “chocolate capital of the world” because it is home to more chocolate factories than any other city on earth. The well-known chocolate makers of Brussels have worked at their trade for over a century. Cocoa beans first entered Europe in the late 16th century when Spanish explorers brought them back from Mexico; it took a century for them to reach Belgium. Belgian chocolate started building its impressive reputation in the late 1800s when King Leopold II harvested cocoa crops in the colonized African Congo. In 1920, Cappadocian Greek American confectioner Leonidas Kestelides (or Kestekidis) founded the Leonidas chocolate brand after marrying Joanna Teerlinck, a young lady from Brussels. He first came to Belgium to attend the Brussels Universal Exhibition at the Brussels World Fair of 1910 as a member of the Greek delegation from the United States. He presented his chocolate at the fair and won a bronze medal. In 1913, he opened a tea room in Ghent. In 1924, Leonidas opened Pâtisserie Centrale, a tea-room on Rue Paul Delvaux in Brussels. His successor Basilio opened his own workshop at 58 Boulevard Anspach; Leonidas’ business was growing rapidly in size and popularity. In 1935, Basilio turned his workshop into a shop after being accused by the police of street trading. An exponential growth period began in 1950 while Basilio opened a \"Laboratoroire de Pralines” (Laboratory of Chocolates) at 20 Vieux Marché aux Grains. He also opened a tea-room in Blankenberge. The first store outside Belgium opened in Lille, France in 1969. The brand eventually goes international selling in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Holland, at Harrods in London and even in Athens. The New York store opened in 1991."

  "text" : "Lauterbach GmbH is a German electronic design automation firm specializing in in-circuit emulators and logic analyzers used for debugging embedded systems. The firm was founded in 1979 by Lothar Lauterbach. In 2009 the firm was renamed from Lauterbach Datentechnik GmbH to Lauterbach GmbH. The company serves a niche-market of in-circuit emulators, especially on systems using JTAG, which it sells under the brand name TRACE32. It is the global market leader in the area of hardware assisted debug tools for embedded systems, with over 80000 development seats sold. They have delivered 65000 debug licenses for the popular ARM microprocessor alone, and they support all available ARM cores. This exclusivity has enabled them to grow strongly in sales in recent years (over 90 million USD in 2011, 83 million USD in 2007 before the financial crisis). Many embedded developers would like to see a higher level of standardization of the on-chip debug and trace logic as well as a reduction in pin count without any performance loss. In order to take an active role in the development of innovative debug and trace technologies, Lauterbach has been participating in the following international committees over the past years: Nexus (standard), MIPI Debug Working Group, SPRINT Forum and Power.org. Lauterbach has local subsidiaries in United Kingdom, United States, Japan, France, Italy, China and Tunisia. The company is privately held by the founding family, with the two brothers Lothar and Stephan Lauterbach as its directors."

  "text" : "Lucky Stores is an American supermarket chain founded in San Leandro, California in 1935. Lucky is currently operated by Save Mart Supermarkets in Northern California. In 1998, Lucky's parent company, American Stores, was taken over by Albertsons, and by 1999 the Lucky brand had disappeared. On January 23, 2006, SuperValu, CVS Pharmacy and an investment group led by Cerberus Capital Management announced they had agreed to acquire Albertsons for $17.4 billion. Existing Albertsons stores were divided between Supervalu and the Cerberus-led group; the Cerberus-acquired stores became Albertsons, which then sold its Northern California and Northern Nevada stores to Save Mart Supermarkets. In 2006, both SuperValu and Save Mart began re-branding some Albertsons locations as Lucky stores, using the old logo. However, the same year, Grocery Outlet, an unrelated Northern California retailer, also began branding some of its stores as Lucky, claiming that Albertsons had given up rights to the Lucky trademark when it had retired the brand in 1999. In January 2009 a federal judge ruled against Grocery Outlet, finding that Albertsons had continued to use the name Lucky even after the re-branding of its stores. SuperValu positioned Lucky as \"'true neighborhood stores,' meaning they meet the unique needs of communities by providing the right products and assortment at the right price.\""

  "text" : "Lima S.p.A (Lima Models) was a brand of railway models made in Vicenza, Italy, for almost 50 years, from the early 1950s until the company ceased trading in 2004. Lima was a popular, affordable brand of 00 gauge and N gauge model railway material in the UK, more detailed H0 and N gauge models in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States as well as South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia. Lima also produced a small range of 0 gauge models. Lima partnered with various distributors and manufacturers, selling under brands such as A.H.M., Model Power, and Minitrain. Market pressures from superior Far Eastern produce in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with Rivarossi, Arnold, and Jouef. Ultimately, these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004. Hornby Railways offered €8 million to acquire Lima's assets (including tooling, inventory, and the various brand names) in March of the same year, the Italian bankruptcy court of Brescia (town near Milan, last headquarters of Lima) approving the offer later that year. In December 2004, Hornby Railways formally announced the acquisition along with the Rivarossi (H0 North American and Italian prototypes), Arnold (N scale European prototypes), Jouef (H0 scale French prototypes), and Pocher (die-cast metal automobile kits) ranges. As of mid-2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and sprung buffers and sockets for DCC (Digital Command Control) decoders."

  "text" : "Live Nation is a live-events company based in Beverly Hills, California, focused on concert promotions. Live Nation formed in 2005 as a spin-off from Clear Channel Communications, which then merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 to become Live Nation Entertainment. Live Nation \"signs\" artists as a \"record label\", but predominantly takes the role of a promoter, rather than \"music owner\". The deal with U2 and Madonna, for example, does not include funding of the artists' future recordings. The 2007 deal signed with Jay-Z does, but he still retains full-ownership of his recordings and Live Nation funded Roc Nation. Live Nation signed Colombian singer Shakira, Canadian band Nickelback and Mexican singer Luis Miguel."

When electric lighting started to be more widely accepted, the name was changed to Lightolier, a contraction of the words light and chandelier. In 2007, Philips Royal Electronics announced that it would acquire the Genlyte Group which would make Lightolier a part of Philips. In its early years, the company specialized in fancy decorative chandeliers then made a shift to high-end design and architectural in the 1920s. In the 1960s, Lightolier introduced the first track lighting system, designed by the late Anthony C. Donato (a vertically integrated track, unlike the horizontal tracks of today). Also notable is the success of the Lytegem series, designed by Michael Lax, that has a place in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Lightolier is also known for its advanced reflector designs, and was the first lighting company to introduce digital lighting systems in the early 1990s. The company is also Sustaining Member of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, a founding member of the American Lighting Association, an ally of the EPA Green Lights program, and a Partner of the Lighting Research Center.

The label of one of their products caused an international uproar and a lawsuit claiming damages from the imagery was ruled in favor of the brewery under First Amendment rights of free speech.

  "text" : "Leap Wireless International, Inc. was a telecommunications operator that provided wireless services to approximately 4.6 million subscribers, the 5th largest, through its subsidiary, Cricket Communications, Inc. It was headquartered in San Diego, California. Leap was founded in 1999 and was built on the premise of unlimited services with no contracts and no credit checks, providing access to wireless services to customers who couldn’t otherwise afford it, didn't want the long-term commitment of a one- or two-year contract, or had a moral or religious objection to a credit check. A credit check is normally required for contract plans offered by telecommunications companies. Leap has all-digital CDMA 1X, EV-DO and LTE networks that have expanded significantly in the past few years. On July 12, 2013, AT&T agreed to buy Leap Wireless for $1.2 billion. On March 13, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission approved the merger between AT&T and Leap Wireless. On the same day Leap announced the completion of the acquisition by AT&T."

During that time it produced approximately 80 issues or collections, such as LS-Magazine, LS-Island, LS-Land, LS-Dreams, LS-Stars, LS-Barbie, LS-Flash, LS-Girls, LS-Fantasy, etc., and had thousands of members worldwide. Subscription was done entirely online, and members paid for the service with credit cards. While early collections often featured nude girls in natural poses, later collections also contained many images of girls in sexually suggestive poses. No actual sexual acts were portrayed but there were implied sexual acts. Many later collections also featured the girls wearing custom-tailored costumes. The backgrounds appeared to be custom-built, similar to stage-play sets. Approximately 1500 children, ages eight to 16, were recruited as models in Kiev, Kharkov and Simferopol in Ukraine. Various nude photos were taken and uploaded to servers in the United States and Canada. Quality and quantity of material from that studio was unmatched, and soon it became the most popular child erotica website in the world. The site brought in several hundred thousand dollars in profit during the three years it was in service. It has since been shut down."

  "text" : "Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII) is a intercontinental company. Through its subsidiaries, it is a provider of climate control products for the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration markets around the world. The Company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads. He designed and patented a riveted steel coal-fired furnace, which led to numerous advancements in heating, cooling and climate control solutions. Today the company is focused on three core businesses: Residential Heating and Cooling, Commercial Heating and Cooling, and Refrigeration. The company headquarters are in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas. In 1971 the small, nonprofitable (low pressure) gas cylinder business of Lennox Industries was sold to Worthington Industries, marking its first diversification step."

They primarily offer fully managed network solutions and hosted products to SMEs. Lumison was founded in Leith as edNET in 1996, where its head office remains. It rebranded to the name Lumison in August 2004, and opened a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) dedicated datacentre on a greenfield site in Newbridge, Edinburgh in October 2004 and added a 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) London Datacentre in Croydon, South London in 2008. This has enabled Lumison to provide additional rackspace for managed hosting, dedicated servers, virtualised servers and colocation (colo). In October 2010, a majority stake in Lumison was acquired by Bridgepoint Development Capital in order to fuel growth from its existing position as a Managed IT Services provider into a significant player as a mid-market IT services firm in the UK. Further growth came through the acquisition of Colocation services company, BlueSquare Data Services, and DediPower Managed Hosting Services in 2011. The business has since rebranded under the name of Pulsant. The company now has a turnover of approximately £30m with 130 staff across 5 UK locations. There are 8 data centres in UK and sites in United States, Amsterdam, and Hong Kong."

Much like \"seeing-eye dogs\" from The Seeing Eye, Leader Dogs's trained canines are called \"leader dogs.\" Leader Dogs is a nonprofit organization. All expenses, including room and board, airfare, and the dog itself, are offered free of charge. An Applicant, after being accepted into the program, travels to Leader Dogs headquarters and must spend from nineteen to twenty-six days of training with his or her new dog, after which the dog belongs to the applicant officially. Leader Dogs employs a breeding program to supply dogs, consisting mostly of pure bred Labrador and Golden Retrievers and German Shepherd Dogs. Dogs donated from the general public and animal shelters, who are of fitting physical and mental character, are also sometimes accepted. Additionally, through a partnership with service and hearing dog organization Paws With A Cause, dogs unsuited for the work of their respective programs may be \"career changed\" to another program."

Lion Oil was later sold by Monsanto to Tosco. In 1985, Lion was struggling and on the verge of shutting down and was sold by Tosco to a partnership of Ergon Refining of Jackson, Mississippi, and a group of local investors. This is how it acquired the oil refinery in El Dorado, Arkansas. In March 2011, Delek US Holdings, Inc. of Brentwood, Tennessee acquired Ergon’s 53.7% majority equity interest; total equity ownership by Delek increased to 88.3%; on April 29, 2011 Delek US became the new operator of Lion Oil. In October 2011, Delek US Holdings, Inc. acquired the remaining 11.7% interest to increase its equity interest in Lion Oil to 100%.

Sony Computer Entertainment acquired Guerrilla Games in 2005. The logo of Lost Boys was a white cactus on a red diamond-shaped background. Lost Boys first made name with the creation of the website for Big Brother - a television show by John de Mol, that was first broadcast in The Netherlands. It also created Big Brother: The Game, that was no more than a Pac-Man clone. Lost Boys Games also had a separate handhelds-division called Formula. Under this label it would release four titles, two each for Nintendo's Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance handheld gaming consoles. However, the first game that showed the 'Formula game development' logo was The Lost Ride, released for Philips CD-i in 1998. In the same year also Dodgem Arena, \"the first Dutch PS1 title on the shelves\", was released under the Formula label. The logo of Formula was the same as of Lost Boys Games, only the diamond-shaped background was green instead of red."

  "text" : "Lumon Inc. Is a private Finnish company which specializes in glass and aluminum construction. Pohjois-Karjalan Lasipalvelu limited partnership was established in 1978 at Outokumpu, Finland. In 1981 the company changed its name to Ikkunanikkarit Inc. and moved operations to Kouvola. During 1989 the company became a Public Limited Company and the innovation of inward-opening balcony glass panes without vertical frames was invented. During that particular year Parvekenikkarit Inc. was founded to conduct sales and installation in western and northern Finland, in addition to the Helsinki area. In the beginning of the nineties production was separated from sales and installation operations. As a result, Lumon Oy was established in 1991. In the course of 1996 the company launched new 21st century balcony glazing system and commenced the production of aluminum balustrades, glass terraces and additional panes for existing windows. At that time Lumon Inc. also inaugurated a new balcony glazing plant. The new plant enabled the company to start its own glass processing line: cutting, grinding, drilling, tempering. Since 2001, the company started to manufacture glass facades and aluminum doors and windows. To clarify corporation's organizational structure the group restructured in January 2005: Parvekenikkarit Oy was divided into Lumon Etelä-Suomi (Southern Finland) and Lumon Länsi-Suomi (Western Finland). Lumon products are manufactured by Lumon Oy. In Finland, the products are sold and installed by Lumon Etelä-Suomi (Southern Finland), Länsi-Suomi (Western Finland) and Itä-Suomi (Eastern Finland). However, in the beginning of the year 2010 the domestic sales organization was once more clarified and at the moment the sales are conducted by Lumon Suomi Oy (whole Finland).

  "text" : "Loris Azzaro (9 February 1933 – 20 November 2003) was a French-Italian fashion designer. He was born in Tunisia of Sicilian parents and went to Paris to set up his cloth and perfume lines in 1962. By 1968 his business was a huge success. He was well known for making glamorous party dresses for the elite of French society. Often his creations featured ornate beading and daring cut outs. He was also known to use brightly colored chains woven onto shirts to make intricate chainmail dresses and tops. Over the course of his long career he dressed numerous celebrities including Dalida, Sophia Loren, Raquel Welch, Marisa Berenson, Claudia Cardinale, Isabelle Adjani, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard and Nicole Kidman. Azzaro's collections are always named alphabetically by season. The first season's collection featured clothing all given names starting with an A, the next with B names and so on. Azzaro admitted that he would sometimes skip a letter like Q, X or Z because it was too hard to find names for those letters. Azzaro released a wide range of products including women's and men's clothing lines and accessories as well as a wide range of fragrances. in 1975 he created his first fragrance for women, \"Couture\", which became his signature scent. Over time Azzaro became known for his fragrances as much as his clothing. His favourite colour was blue as he quoted: \"The blue colour is the colour that suits me\". His inspirations came from the surroundings of his country of birth, Tunisia: \"I let myself get carried by the atmosphere of the country of my childhood with its spiced odors, its colors, its flowers and its perfumes. It is the country where I really become myself, the country where my preferred color is everywhere, azure of the sea and the sky.” Loris Azzaro died at the age of 70 in Paris France in November 2003. In November 2003, French designer Vanessa Seward took over as head designer of the Azzaro label until 2011. In October 2006, a new chapter of the renaissance opens up when the Andorran group Reig makes the acquisition of the company Azzaro. The Reig group is an essential actor of the economy of the Principality of Andorra, assets in seven countries, in the areas of de luxe hotel business, estate, tobacco, bank and fashion. Arnaud Maillard and Alvaro Castejon took over from Vanessa Seward as artistic directors of the house, and presented their first collection in June 2013."

The bank also has similarity with other traditional overseas Chinese bank in the United States of its era in that it concentrated on serving the local Chinese communities, but its clients were rather upper middle class in comparison to its counterparts, and while it did not have as many offices as its counterparts in California, it did have a representative offices in Flushing, Queens for its rather a unique way of expansion. In May 2013, the bank was acquired by Royal Business Bank for an undisclosed amount."

  "text" : "Libyana (Arabic: ليبيانا‎‎) was a Libyan mobile phone company established in 2004. It was one of two mobile phone operators owned by the General Posts and Telecommunications Company (GPTC). Muhammad Gaddafi, the eldest son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, was the chairman. Libyana entered the Libyan market with low-cost services to compete with the existing Almadar Mobile Provider, which was also later bought by GPTC. As part of the Libyan Civil War, part of the Libyana network has been disconnected to create a rebel owned cell network, called Free Libyana."

  "text" : "Libya Telecom & Technology (LTT) (Arabic: ليبيا للاتصالات والتقنية‎‎) was established in 1997 as a private company by Ahmed A. Al-Mosbahi. LTT remains a state owned monopoly which continues to dominate the Libyan ISP sector. LTT is Libya's most-used service provider, and much of the country's 5.6% (380,000 user) Internet penetration is attributable to its DSL and WiMAX services. Ahmed A. Al-Mosbahi was the Chairman of LTT and all telecom companies in Libya. After the Libyan Civil War and the subsequent collapse of the Gaddafi regime, LTT is trying to revamp its network and services. However, due to internal conflict and rising strain on services, many popular provisions have been plagued by network congestion and poor reception. In March 2012, Saad Ksheer was appointed CEO of the company, following his previous posts with Microsoft and NCR in the USA and UAE. Later Saad was sacked and replaced. If a consumer poll were to be released on how well LTT supplies its networking service, it would ( speculatively ) receive one of the worlds lowest internet providers ranking with much needed room for improvement.LTT has informed its consumers that the slow speeds are due to poor reception, however this does not appear to be the case, as it seems that speeds are either capped or the network is simply not working to its full potential as advertised and sold. Libya is in dire need of up to standard 'Internationally accepted' Internet networking service speeds ( 2015 ), all of which are yet to be supplied by companies interested in investing in the young and extremely potential market with little competition in Libya."

In November 2006, Lyrtech released a small form factor software defined radio development platform in partnership with Texas Instruments and Xilinx. Its Innovator division, acquired in 2006, for nearly $3M, was sold back for roughly $300,000 in late 2007 as part of a restructuring plan designed to save the company. Lyrtech was ranked 43 in the 2007 Canadian Technology Fast 50 by Deloitte. In November 2011, the company's assets were taken as repayment by one of the main creditors, Finex Corp. Following this move, Lyrtech was left without assets and operations and has been delisted from TSX-V. Last trades were at 0.005 (1/2 cent) per share, giving the company valuation at about $200,000."

  "text" : "Lowry Digital is a digital film restoration company based in Burbank, California. It is part of India's Reliance Big Entertainment, which is part of the Reliance ADA Group. John D. Lowry gained industry recognition in 1971 for his computer-based proprietary algorithms used in the restoration of the NASA Apollo missions 16 and 17 films. As of December 15, 2006, Lowry Digital has 700 Apple Power Mac G5s, a server bay with 700 terabytes of storage and two $300,000 digital motion picture film scanners. The company is becoming increasingly involved in work on digital 3-D films, such as U2 3D and Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D. Reliance MediaWorks (formerly known as Lowry Digital) was instrumental in adapting existing technology and developing new image processing techniques that set a new standard for 3-D in the landmark film Avatar. The Burbank, California subsidiary was lauded in helping Avatar — the highest-grossing film in history — to earn its Academy Awards for technical achievement. Lowry describes the restoration process as overcoming three obstacles: wear and tear, age, and multiple generations of optical copies. Each frame is scanned into a high-resolution digital format, where the computer first checks for standard problems like size alterations or jitter. Then the files go through the lab's render farm for speck removal, which is then eye-checked frame-by-frame. The system works natively in 32-bit floating point, can process any format like HD and 4K, and outputs to a pristine digital master. Lowry Digital’s advanced digital image processing is also used to minimize grain in image quality without losing any quality, even in modern major motion-picture releases like Miami Vice and Zodiac. On 16 July 2009, in time for the 40th anniversary of the moon landing, NASA tasked Lowry Digital to restore original video footage of the missing Apollo moon landing tapes. At a cost of $230,000 the refurbishing effort is only three weeks into a months-long project, with about 40 percent of the work completed. Lowry president Mike Inchalik commented that the video \"is by far and away the lowest quality,\" the company has dealt with."

The company was founded by Antoine Roset in 1860 in Montagnieu, France as a small business manufacturing bentwood walking sticks. In 1936, the company started manufacturing upholstered furniture and presently they design and manufacture household furniture, lighting, accessories, and textiles from a team of 50 European designers. Among Ligne Roset's most recognized pieces is the Togo line of seating, designed by Michel Ducaroy in 1973. It features ergonomic designs with 5 densities of foam combined to make the frame. The foam construction and quilted covers make each piece both visually attractive and very comfortable. Known for its artful collaborations with both established and up-and-coming talents in contemporary design, Ligne Roset offers consumers an entire lifestyle in which to live both boldly and beautifully via its furniture collections and complimentary decorative accessories, lighting, rugs, textiles and occasional items.In-house manufacturing allows Ligne Roset to closely supervise the entire product creation process and uphold the highest production standards.Matching its deeply held belief in design with investment and technical innovation, Ligne Roset has grown from a small business to a multinational company with factories and headquarters in France and more than 200 exclusive Ligne Roset stores and 1,000 retail distributors worldwide. All the while, the company has been family-run since its inception in 1860."

  "text" : "The Leeds and Selby Railway was an early British railway company and first mainline railway within Yorkshire. It was opened in 1834. As built, the line ran west/east between two termini, Marsh Lane station, Leeds and Selby railway station. The company was leased and then acquired by the York and North Midland Railway in 1840 and 1844; the line remained in use through the subsequent NER, LNER, BR and post-privatisation periods. Use of the line was expanded through junction connections to new railways, most built in the late 19th century; a junction with the York and North Midland Railway in 1839; an end on junction at Selby to Hull (Hull and Selby Railway, 1840); a through route into Leeds and westward (Leeds viaduct extension, 1869); a shortened route to York (Micklefield to Church Fenton, 1869); a line to Wetherby (Cross Gates to Wetherby Line, 1876, closed 1964); a line to Castleford (Garforth to Castleford Line, 1878, closed 1969) and a line avoiding Selby for Goole (Selby to Goole Line, 1910, closed 1964) as well as a number of minor and industrial lines and sidings. The Selby Diversion of the East Coast Main Line (1983) also made junctions with the Leeds and Selby. As of 2014, the line is still in mainline use and use for services operated by First TransPennine Express and Northern Rail for services from Leeds to Selby, Hull, York and beyond."

  "text" : "Lex Autolease was created in 2009 from the merger of HBOS owned Lex Vehicle Leasing with Lloyds TSB Autolease and is the United Kingdom's largest vehicle leasing business with a fleet of about 270,000 vehicles. One in every thirty new cars sold in the UK is through Lex Autolease. Lex Vehicle Leasing was owned by HBOS between 2006 and 2009, part owned with Aviva in 2006 when it was part of their RAC plc company only the year before. Following the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB Group, which owned Autolease since 2000, the new Lloyds Banking Group merged the two operations into the new Lex Autolease. At the time of the merge, Lex was carrying a debt of GB£2.4 billion. The company can trace its origins back to 1959 when both Lex and Autolease were established. Lex was established in the 1920s, but in 1959 it acquired British Colonial Motors which allowed it to enter the contract hire business. Autolease was established in the same year by Britax, which also owned Bristol Street Motors. Lex has been successful in the last few years, taking on a number of large 'white label' contracts such as HSBC Vehicle Finance and Ford Business Partner."

Lincraft was founded in 1938 by Leo Ross as a stall shop in Melbourne. In 2005, Lincraft was in receivership due to a slump in Christmas sales. In 2010, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) reported that Lincraft had sold imported bathrobes which failed to meet safety and labelling standards, but that they accepted Lincraft's efforts to prevent similar occurrences in the future."

  "text" : "Lifestyle Pets, formerly Allerca, is a Delaware-based biotechnology company that claims to have bred hypoallergenic cats through a selective breeding process. The company was originally incorporated in California. According to company literature, the company's cats have significantly reduced levels of a particular protein that humans suffer allergic reactions to. The journal Nature reported in September 2006 that in an Allerca-funded study, Sheldon Spector, a clinical allergy expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, found the company's cats to be less allergy-inducing than the control. However, neither the study nor its underlying data have been published, and Spector himself advises caution as regards his study's interpretation as he used an experimental setup that is generally regarded as less than reliable. A July 2006 article in the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that no details about the cats have been released, nor have there been any peer-reviewed studies published about the company's work. Cat experts also questioned whether the company's breeding model - stated at the time to be up to 10,000 cats by 2009 - was viable. Time named the company's cats among its list of Best Inventions for 2006. Allerca refuses to provide its kittens to clients whose allergy test results \"indicate a level that includes HIGH\". A cat based on the Domestic shorthair cost US$6,950 while ones based on the Siamese and Ashera cost $16,900 and $26,950 respectively. In February 2006, Allerca was evicted from its San Diego headquarters, an address that doubled as the founder Simon Brodie's home. Brodie's previous businesses have \"left behind unhappy clients, unpaid employees, debts, lawsuits, court judgments and liens....\" The company Transgenic Pets sued Allerca and Brodie for theft of trade secrets and business plans. Allerca settled. The settlement agreed that Allerca would not re-enter the genetically engineered allergen free cat market until May 31, 2006. For a while, Allerca offered a franchising program, possibly in violation of California law. Reports from Allerca indicate that they accepted at least partial payment from potential franchisees. The company announced that on January 1, 2010 they will cease their breeding activities. However, their website remains active, and recent online complaints suggest that they are still in business. A report by ABC news in July 2013  confirms that the cats sold by Lifestyle Pets are no more hypoallergenic than any other cat."

  "text" : "La Poste is a postal service company in France, operating in Metropolitan France as well as in the five French overseas departments and the overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Because of bilateral agreements, La Poste also has the responsibility of mail services in Monaco through La Poste Monaco and in Andorra alongside the Spanish company Correos. The company was created in 1991 following the split of the French PTT, a government department responsible for mail, telegraph and telephone services in France. The PTT, founded in 1879, were then divided between La Poste, which became responsible for postal service, and France Télécom (nowadays Orange) for the telecommunication services. France Télécom was immediately privatised but La Poste has remained a public company. However, because of EU directives requiring member states to introduce competition in their postal service, the French government allowed private postal service companies in 2005 and transformed La Poste into a public-owned company limited by shares in 2010. Following the examples of Royal Mail in the United Kingdom or Poste italiane in Italy, the French government might sell its shares and float them on the stock exchange in the near future. La Poste is a parent company of the Groupe La Poste, which also comprises a bank and insurance company (La Banque postale), a logistics service company (Geopost) and a mobile network operator (La Poste Mobile). Although its postal activities are declining because of the development of the Internet, they still represented half of the company's income. Other activities, such as parcel delivery and banking, are on the rise. The two represented respectively a quarter of the company's income in 2014."

  "text" : "Lone Star Comics was a chain of comic book stores located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in north central Texas. The chain's offerings included comic books, action figures, gaming supplies, videos, and many other pop culture items. Originally established as a quaint mail order company in 1961 by area fanzine publisher and entrepreneur Jake \"Buddy\" Saunders, Lone Star opened its first brick-and-mortar store in 1977, eventually operating a chain of nine retail outlets in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. While still maintaining business locally, the company returned to its mail order roots in the early 2000s, this time as an online subscription and back-issue service. With the contraction of the overall economy beginning in 2008, the store sold off their various locations, closing the final one in the fall of 2013. The online store is called mycomicshop.com."

The company was founded by Ross Cascio, who sold the company on January 20, 1981. The firm became controversial in the late 1960s and 1970s, with Chicago Daily News columnist Mike Royko publishing several articles on Cascio's alleged strong-arm tactics, Aldermanic candidate Dick Simpson making the firm a campaign issue, and folk singer Steve Goodman writing a song about the firm, calling them the \"Lincoln Park Pirates.\" The company describes itself as relocators who protect property owners from illegal parkers on parking lots with contracts for the company's services. Its business is parking enforcement, and the company does not provide roadside assistance. The company, its relocators and its dispatchers are regulated and licensed by the Illinois Commerce Commission."

  "text" : "L. Strauss & Co. was a distinctly upscale department store chain headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The store was founded in 1853 and declared bankruptcy 140 years later in 1993. The store originally was named the Eagle Clothing Company. Eagle Clothing became one of the city's retailing leaders and reportedly pioneered in the use of fixed prices for customers. In 1879, Leopold Strauss acquired the store and later changed the name to L. Strauss and Company. The main store for many years was located on the southeast corner of Washington Street at Illinois (formerly the Occidental Building). In 1969, Genesco—a conglomerate based in Nashville, Tennessee, and owner of such stores as Bonwit Teller—acquired L. Strauss and hired Thad Larson as president. Seeking to keep the store under local control, Larson purchased the store from Genesco in 1979. The Washington Street store was torn down in the 1980s in order to make way for Circle Centre Mall. In the bankruptcy filing, one of the reasons listed for the bankruptcy was delays in opening of Circle Centre. The downtown store moved across the street to Claypool Court, atop which sits the Indianapolis Embassy Suites Downtown Hotel. L. Strauss's main competitors were L. S. Ayres, William H. Block Co. and H. P. Wasson and Company. During the store's existence, winners of the Indianapolis 500 were presented, in addition to the Borg-Warner Trophy, the L. Strauss & Co. Trophy."

  "text" : "Longchamp is a French luxury leather goods company, founded in Paris in 1948 by Jean Cassegrain. Jean Cassegrain produced the world's first luxury leather-covered pipes, then expanded into small leather goods, such as wallets, passport covers... Longchamp launched its first women handbag in 1971 and became one of France's leading leather goods makers. The company's real breakthrough came with the use of nylon. In the 1970s, Longchamp created a leather and nylon fabric luggage collection. For the first time, luggage were light, contrary to the overweight suitcases usually sold at that time. This innovation led the company to design a women's handbag known throughout the world: Le Pliage, few decades later. The company's most iconic product is its innovative \"Le Pliage\" women's foldable handbag. The handbag was an instant hit and continues to be the company's best selling product. Le Pliage's signature design, which originated in nylon, has been re-envisioned and re-invented in countless shapes, patterns, colors and fabrics. The company today designs and manufactures a wide range of luxury goods including leather and canvas handbags, luggage, shoes, travel items, fashion accessories, and a line of \"ready-to-wear\" women's designer clothing. The company serves clients worldwide in 80 countries through around 1,500 retail outlets, including more than 300 upscale luxury boutiques on famous streets and beautiful avenues. The house is still privately owned and managed by the Cassegrain founding family."

It also does oncology testing, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping and phenotyping. LabCorp also operates the National Genetics Institute, Inc. (NGI) in Los Angeles, California which develops PCR testing methods. LabCorp's ViroMed facility, originally in Minnetonka, Minnesota until closing this site in 2013, is now housed in Burlington, NC and performs real-time PCR microbial testing using laboratory-developed assays. LabCorp also provides testing in Puerto Rico and, outside the United States, in three Canadian provinces. LabCorp Utilizes 7 PA-31-350's and 1 PC-12 aircraft on nightly runs from Burlington, NC for use on the east coast.

  "text" : "Leeann Chin is a Bloomington, Minnesota-based Asian quick service restaurant chain, with about 50 locations, mostly in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. The chain was founded by its namesake, Leeann Chin, funded by Carl Pohlad (banker and former owner of the Minnesota Twins) and actor Sean Connery. The concept received Best Chinese Food and Best Takeout Food as well as being voted No. 80 in a list of the country’s top 100 by fast casual restaurant industry website FastCasual.com in 2011. It is currently owned by Los Angeles-based financier, West Coast Capital principal and former investment banker Lorne Goldberg, who also owns the popular Asian chains Pick Up Stix and Mandarin Express. The chain offers chicken entrees, in addition to beef and shrimp options, prepared in Mongolian, Hunan, and Szechuan styles from mild to spicy. The restaurant recently added low calorie options and has its own proprietary frozen yogurt named Red Cherry. The concept was founded by Leeann Chin, a Chinese immigrant who moved to Minnesota in 1957. She opened her first location in Minnetonka, Minnesota in 1980 and another in St. Paul in 1984. General Mills bought the name to her restaurants and the restaurants in 1984 with plans to expand the chain nationally. However, locations opened in Chicago faltered and General Mills put an end to the opening new restaurants. The restaurants and name were bought back from General Mills by Leeann Chin Inc. in 1988, by Chin with the help of Capital Dimensions Venture Fund. Lorne Goldberg bought the chain in 2007. Goldberg invested about $8 million in the chain and quickly revitalized the decor of the restaurants and improved its menu, introducing new items that were initially developed for Mandarin Express’ restaurants. The new items and location remodels quickly accounted for an increase of about 20 percent of sales. Goldberg also moved away from operating takeout counters within Lunds and Byerly’s grocery stores. In 2011, Leeann Chin Inc. began to expand outside of its base in Minnesota’s Twin Cities with opening of its Fargo, North Dakota restaurant and later opened a location in Duluth, Minnesota. In 2013, the chain launched its AsiaFit menu, a selection of low calorie (400 calories) stir-fry dishes, following a trend among casual-dining restaurants for lighter, healthier meals. Goldberg told the press that he is interested in being an owner and building the Leeann Chin brand over many years to come."

On Dec 26, 2006, the service was chosen as a website of the year (2006) by the biggest newspaper in Israel (Ynetnews),. The Western Wall, which was a part of the Holy Temple, was open to visiting gentiles. When King Solomon built the Temple, he asked God to heed all the prayers of those who come to the Temple (Kings I 8:41-43). The prophets refer to the Temple as a \"House for all nations\" (Isaiah 56.7)."

Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015. Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation."

  "text" : "The Lubrizol Corporation is a provider of specialty chemicals for the transportation, industrial, and consumer markets. These products include additives for engine oils and other transportation-related fluids, additives for industrial lubricants, and additives for gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Lubrizol makes ingredients and additives for personal care products and pharmaceuticals, specialty materials, including plastics technology, and coatings in the form of specialty resins and additives. In 2007, the company was listed as 512 on the Fortune 1000. It has since moved up to 453 on the 2010 list. On the basis of 2010 profitability metrics, total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share growth, Lubrizol was the top performing company among the 16 chemical companies that are on the Fortune 500. As of May 2011, the company was ranked at 1220 in the Forbes Global 2000 list, based on a combination of revenues, net income, assets and market value. On March 14, 2011, Berkshire Hathaway announced an agreement to purchase Lubrizol for US$9.7 billion. This happened just weeks after a top Berkshire executive, David Sokol, made a major bet on the stock price with his own money. On April 3, 2014, Lubrizol announced the setting-up of a US$ 50 million compound manufacturing unit in Dahej, Gujarat, which will be Buffett's first investment in India. On November 17, 2015, a fire occurred at Lubrizol's Oilfield Chemistry Leetsdale, Pennsylvania facility, formally owned by Weatherford International. The fire started in a manufacturing facility during the process of adding chemicals to a production tank that blends products used in oilfield applications, such as hydraulic fracturing. Chemicals housed in the facility included ammonium persulfate and sodium chlorite. During the fire, local authorities directed nearby businesses and residents on safety procedures, including evacuations and/or sheltering in place. Eight people reported injuries due to the fire. All were treated and released. As of December 2015, the cause of the fire is not yet known."

It is the first company on the market with a product that monolithically incorporates active optics for data communications manufactured with low-cost silicon-based chip processing. This class of technology (also being aggressively developed by large companies such as Intel and IBM) is widely predicted to displace large portions of the existing photonics industry that rely on discrete assemblies of electronic and photonic devices. Luxtera's partners include Freescale Semiconductor (fabricates Luxtera's chips). Luxtera is a Caltech spin-out with funding from venture capital, its business partners, and DARPA. It was founded by a number of members of Prof. Axel Scherer's lab group, including Cary (Lawrence) Gunn, Michael Hochberg, Tom Baehr-Jones, and also Axel Scherer. Other co-founders include Prof. Eli Yablonovitch and John Oxaal. In 2010, Luxtera was selected as one of MIT Technology Review's 50 Most Innovative Companies."

Laverda formed a partnership with Fiat in 1981, and would be a part of that company for some 20 years. The Morra family's holding company, ARGO SpA, bought Laverda in 2000 as Fiat was merging its New Holland Agriculture group with Case IH to form CNH Global. In 2007, ARGO sold 50% of the Laverda business to AGCO, the remaining 50% of the joint venture was eventually sold in 2011 and the Breganze plant became AGCO's European center of excellence for harvesting."

  "text" : "The company traces its origins to the 19th century, when the Theodor Riegert company was one of the largest confectioners in the Baltic Provinces of the Russian Empire. Despite the loss of Russian markets, the company maintained its major market position domestically following Latvia's independence in 1918. The current company name was adopted in 1925 after a merger with two brothers Eliyahu and Leonid Fromenchenko (also spelled Fromchenko). In 1933, after the two Russian Jews sold the company, Eliyahu Fromchenko founded Elite in Israel at Ramat Gan. During both the 1930s and Soviet period in Latvia, Laima was the main chocolatier in Latvia, with L.W. Goegginger (later renamed Uzvara by the Soviets) being the main producer of hard candies. After Latvia regained its independence in the 1990s, Laima amalgamated with both Uzvara and cookie, wafer, and cake manufacturer Staburadze to become a single company under the Laima name. Unlike similar regional producers of cherished national brands, such as Lithuania's Karūna, Sweden's Marabou, and Norway's Freia, Laima managed to avoid being bought out by an international player like Kraft Foods. Ownership of Laima is controlled by Nordic Food, owned by local businessman Daumants Vītols. After introducing Laima shares to the Riga Stock Exchange in December 2006, the controlling owners decided to once again make the company private, taking it off the market on 13 July 2007. The parent company of Laima was acquired by Orkla Group in August 2014."

This product was based on ideas that Winer had been developing for a few years since University.Winer ported the application to run on IBM PC compatible computers and after seeing a demo of Apple's near-release Macintosh, Winer hired his brother Peter Winer to develop a version of ThinkTank for the Macintosh, which by April 1985 had sold 30,000 copies, or to about 10% of all Mac owners. Doug Baron was also hired to work on the Macintosh version of ThinkTank. Work began on another outliner application at the end of 1984 called MORE, which expanded on the graphical concepts that they had started to add to ThinkTank, for example letting users easily convert outlines into bullet charts to be used in presentations. By 1986, the company grew to 50 people.The company underwent temporary financial difficulties, which were resolved upon the release of MORE in 1986. Before merging with Symantec, Winer first met with Bill Gates, the co-founder and then-President, CEO, and chair of Microsoft, in February 1987.Gates wrote a letter of intent to purchase the company in return for shares of Microsoft.However, the deal fell through and Microsoft instead purchased Living Videotext's competitor, Forethought, Inc., makers of Powerpoint, in a $14-million deal. Powerpoint went on to achieve widespread popularity as part of the Microsoft Office suite. After receiving a number of other offers, Living Videotext merged with Symantec in September 1987. Many of its most popular products were, with Symantec's support, later released for free as \"antique versions\"."

  "text" : "Lucas Entertainment is a New York-based gay pornographic studio started by porn star Michael Lucas. It is one of the largest such studios in the world. The studio is known for lavish, big-budget movies, and it contends that its 2006 film Michael Lucas' La Dolce Vita is the most expensive gay porn ever made. The film won 14 GayVN awards in 2007, the current record. To expand its direction, the studio hired mr. Pam Doré, gay adult film's only female videographer, as creative director of film and production in August 2008. Doré, who began her career at Falcon Video in 1996, was nominated for best director and cinematography at the GayVN Awards for the studio's 2008 Return to Fire Island. In May 2009, Lucas Entertainment announced that it was filming on location the first gay porn movie with only Israeli models, billing it as an effort to promote Israeli culture. The company subsequently launched its Men of Israel microsite introducing the actors and film concept. Lucas has called the film his most important, and journalists from The Atlantic, Out Magazine and Yediot Aharonot noted it as a landmark film as the first pornographic movie shot on location with an all-Israeli cast; while Tablet Magazine and the Los Angeles Times remarked on it being the first to feature an all-Jewish cast. In July, the studio announced on Lucas's blog that it will open a European headquarters in Paris, the site of its current production, Paris Playboys. In 2013 Lucas Entertainment went from being exclusively a condom-only studio to filming and releasing \"bareback\" sex content."

  "text" : "Lillehammer Olympiapark AS, trading as Olympiaparken, is a company established following the 1994 Winter Olympics to operate the Olympic venues in Lillehammer, Norway. Owned by Lillehammer Municipality, it operates five sports venues: Birkebeineren Ski Stadium, Håkons Hall, Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track, Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena and the ski jumping hill of Lysgårdsbakken. In addition to serving sports events, the company provides tourist and group activities at the venues as well as catering to larger events. In the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, the agreement between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility was taken over by Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into. A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality."

  "text" : "Lionel Kiddie City was an American Toy store under the ownership of Lionel Corp.. Kiddie City Toy Stores were started in the 1960s. By the early 1980s, Lionel operated 150 stores, under the names Lionel Kiddie City, Lionel Playworld, and Lionel Toy Warehouse. For a time it was the second-largest toy store chain in the United States. Lionel ran into financial trouble during the early 1980s recession and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 1982. After reducing itself in size to 55 stores, it emerged from bankruptcy in September 1985. By 1991, the chain grew to 100 stores and was the fourth-largest toy retailer in the country, but once again ran into trouble due to a combination of factors. In 1989 the Robert I. Toussie L.P., a partnership of several retail executives, attempted to buy the company. Lionel resisted, and the fight drained the company of cash. Meanwhile, non-specialty discount stores expanded their toy sections and undercut the prices of specialty toy chains. Additionally, Lionel found it difficult to compete on price with the larger Toys \"R\" Us, and the chain attempted to expand too rapidly in a weakened economy. After several successive unprofitable quarters, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 14, 1991. In 1992 Lionel attempted to reverse its fortunes by merging with the bankrupt Child World, the United States' #3 toy retailer, but was unable to secure financing. By February 1993 Lionel had closed all but 29 stores in six states, concentrating on the markets of Philadelphia, central New Jersey, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Ohio and south Florida. Unable to reach an agreement for reorganization with its creditors, on June 2, 1993, Lionel announced its intention to liquidate all of its stores and go out of business. The Lionel trademarks were purchased by Richard Kughn, a Detroit real estate magnate who had bought the Lionel product line from General Mills in 1986. See Lionel, LLC."

  "text" : "La Rinascente (derived from Rinascita - means \"rebirth\" in Italian) is a Thai owned Italian retailer operating upscale department stores in the area of clothing, household and beauty products, founded in Milan in 1917 by Senatore Borletti from the merger of the businesses \"Alle città d'Italia\" and \"Magazzini Vittoria\". On May 27, 2011 Central Retail bought a 100% stake of the 150-year-old store firm for 260 million euros. \"Our ultimate goal is to take it global and to be recognised all across Asia, be it in Thailand, China, Japan or Hong Kong,\" Chief Executive Officer Tos Chirathivat told reporters. Central Retail also planned new Rinascente stores in Italy and expected the takeover to break even within eight years. Currently La Rinascente owns a chain of 11 department stores located in Italian major cities: two in Rome and one in Milan, Genoa, Turin, Florence, Palermo, Catania, Cagliari, Padova and Monza.The flagship concept store is La Rinascente Milano Piazza Duomo, in Milan. Vittorio Radice joined the company in 2005 and is credited with its turnaround. The retail chain is known for its collaboration with contemporary designers and architects such as Fabio Novembre, Future Systems, Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and Vincent Van Duysen."

  "text" : "Little Chef is a chain of roadside restaurants in the United Kingdom, founded in 1958 by entrepreneur Sam Alper, and modelled on American diners. It specialises in the \"Olympic Breakfast\", its version of a full English, and \"Jubilee Pancakes\". The restaurants are mostly located on sites on A roads, often paired with a Travelodge motel and a petrol station. They used to be on motorways in Moto Services but were removed in 2009. The chain expanded rapidly throughout the 1970s and 1980s, largely organically, although in 1986 it acquired Happy Eater, its only major roadside competitor. It peaked in numbers in 1999 - 2000 with 439 restaurants, but restructuring has seen this reduced to 71. The Little Chef brand has been in decline for many years, largely due to a lack of investment, a tired menu, increased competition, and predominant use of motorways rather than A-roads for long-distance journeys. Little Chef has been owned by six different companies since its mid-1980s heyday. It was owned by Trusthouse Forte from the 1970s, who were taken over by Granada Hospitality, a division of Granada plc. then being 'spun out' into Compass, who themselves sold the chain to the private equity firm Permira. They subsequently divested the chain to The People's Restaurant Group, who in turn sold the chain to the business turnaround specialists RCapital. Planned and reactive investment in the fabric and infrastructure of the chain ended with the sale from Forte, which may explain why many of the interiors appear to date from this, early 1990s, era. In July 2013 RCapital sold LittleChef to the UK arm of Kuwaiti-owned Kout Food Group."

The Society is owned by over 250,000 members who hold Lincolnshire Co-op dividend cards, equal to approximately one quarter of the population of Greater Lincolnshire. The society also owns the Gadsby's bakery which is based in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. As a co-operative, it shares all its profits with members. Ways of doing this include paying dividend and a dividend bonus at the end of the year, investing in new and improved services and supporting community groups and charities. During the 2014-15 year a sum equivalent to 5% of pre-tax profits was distributed to community initiatives. Since Lincolnshire County Council closed a number of libraries across the county, the Linconshire Co-operative has operated five libraries within its food stores and pharmacies and offers library book deliveries in areas covered by its pharmacy delivery scheme. In the last full year of trading, 2014/15, Lincolnshire Co-op recorded sales of £293m and profit of £19.2m of which more than 50% of trade was with members. This figure included a like-for-like food sales increase of 1.4% and an increase of 7.4% at its Gadsby's bakery. The society was able to pay its members a total of £3.4m in dividend and dividend bonus during the year."

  "text" : "Lion's Choice is a Saint Louis-based quick service restaurant chain specializing in roast beef sandwiches. Lion’s Choice started with a vision to serve the best roast beef sandwich in the Midwest in a clean, quick and courteous manner. Lion’s Choice is famous for serving lean, butcher-shop-quality, top-round roast beef, slow-roasted daily on-site, shaved thin to order and served with a dash of secret seasoning on a toasted and steamed bun. Its long-standing devotion to quality, taste and nutrition, has earned the restaurant a loyal customer base. The first store was opened by a group of friends in Ballwin, Missouri in 1967. The concept was originally named Brittany Beef and quickly changed to Red Lion Beef House. The name \"Red Lion\" was already trademarked requiring the owners to find a new name. The search for a new name brought them back to their childhood days. Back in their day, if you were lucky enough to have the best of something - like field level baseball tickets for a big game - it was said that you had the \"lion's choice\". Since their restaurant set the standard for high quality food and great customer service, they renamed it Lion's Choice. In 2013, the original founders sold the company to Saint Louis-based private investors. There are 25 locations in Missouri, all of which are in or near Greater Saint Louis. The restaurant has sponsored a number of charities and teams, such as Shamrocks Against Dystrophy, the St. Louis County Library Reading Club, the MS 150 Bike Tour, and Trailnet. It was the Missouri state winner for the National Restaurant Association's Restaurant Neighbor Award in 2006. and was named Best Fast Food by the Riverfront Times. Because of its specialization in roast beef, Arby's is considered Lion's Choice's direct competition. The company has developed a cult-like following from some customers in the St. Louis market. Since the purchase of the chain by a small private-equity firm from the original founders, it has been involved in much litigation with its largest franchisee that has been reported by the St. Louis media."

Additionally, In 2011, CNN Money /Fortune Magazine ranked Lincolnshire Management as the 5th ranked private equity firm.

Prior to founding Lincolnshire, Wright had spent 31 years at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, where he ran the special finance division, which handled financing for leveraged buyouts in the early 1980s. After Wright's death in 1992, James Tozer was named president and chief executive and was succeeded in 1998 by T.J. Maloney. In 2005, Kumble left the firm to found Corinthian Capital. The firm has raised approximately $1.7 billion and completed more than 55 investments since inception across four private equity funds. Lincolnshire did not raise its first institutional private equity fund until 1994 when it raised $120 million of commitments. In 2008, Lincolnshire completed fundraising for its fourth private equity fund with $835 million of investor commitments, in excess of its original target and nearly twice the size of its $433 million third fund in 2005. Among the firm's most notable investments include Riddell, Prince Sports, and American Coach Lines. In August 2009 Lincolnshire invested in Wabash National Corporation, a manufacturer of flat-bed trailers, which had previously acquired Transcraft, a Lincolnshire portfolio company."

  "text" : "The Livescribe paper-based computing platform consists of a digital pen, digital paper, software applications, and developer tools. Central to the Livescribe platform is the smartpen, a ballpoint pen with an embedded computer and digital audio recorder. When used with Anoto digital paper, it records what it writes for later uploading to a computer, and synchronizes those notes with any audio it has recorded. This allows users to replay portions of a recording by tapping on the notes they were taking at the time the recording was made. It is also possible to select which portion of a recording to replay by clicking on the relevant portion of a page on-screen, once it has been synced to the Livescribe Desktop software. Jim Marggraff, inventor of the LeapFrog FLY Pentop computer and creator of the LeapPad Learning System, left Leapfrog in 2005 to form Livescribe. In November 2015, Livescribe announced its acquisition by Anoto for $15m."

  "text" : "Lotte Co., Ltd. (ロッテ, Hangul: 롯데) is a multinational conglomerate with headquarters in South Korea and Japan. Lotte was first established in June 1948 in Tokyo, by Shin Kyuk-ho(신격호) (also known as Takeo Shigemitsu). With the money he earned in Japan, Shin expanded to his home country, South Korea with the establishment of Lotte Confectionery in Seoul on April 3, 1967. Lotte eventually grew to become South Korea's eighth largest business conglomerate. Lotte Group consists of over 60 business units employing 60,000 people engaged in such diverse industries as candy manufacturing, beverages, hotels, fast food, retail, financial services, heavy chemicals, electronics, IT, construction, publishing, and entertainment. Lotte's major operations are overseen by Shin's family in Japan and South Korea, with additional businesses in China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, USA, UK, Russia, Philippines, Pakistan and Poland (Lotte bought Poland's largest candy company Wedel from Kraft Foods in June 2010). Today, Lotte is the largest confectionery manufacturer in South Korea, and is the third largest in Japan behind Meiji Seika and Ezaki Glico in terms of sales revenue when only the sales of Lotte's confectioneries are counted."

  "text" : "Little Tikes is an American-based manufacturer of children's toys, with headquarters and manufacturing located in Hudson, Ohio. The company also has other manufacturing and distribution facilities in Asia and Europe. Little Tikes' products are mostly low-tech molded plastic toys aimed primarily at infants and young children, for indoor and outdoor use, including its party kitchen and turtle sandbox. The company was established by Thomas G. Murdough Jr. in November 10, 1969 in Aurora, Ohio. The company was acquired by Rubbermaid in 1984. Murdough signed an employment agreement with Rubbermaid under which he would stay with the new parent company for a five-year period as president and general manager. In May 1989, Murdough announced that he would be leaving Little Tikes at the end of that year to pursue other interests. In 1991, Murdough established a new toy business called Step 2, now based in Streetsboro, Ohio, aimed at competing with and outselling Little Tikes. In 1999, Rubbermaid merged with Newell to form Newell Rubbermaid. The company was acquired by MGA Entertainment in September 2006 from Newell Rubbermaid for an undisclosed sum. As of 2006, the 500 employees at Little Tikes were generating approximately $250 million in revenue of Rubbermaid's $6.3 billion in annual sales, and the acquisition was projected to add $15 to $25 million to MGA Entertainment's bottom line. The purchase was said to allow a better fit with MGA Entertainment, a manufacturer of children's toys and entertainment products founded in 1979 whose products included the Bratz line of fashion dolls. The firm's red and yellow Cozy Coupe toy car reached 6 million units in sales by its 25th anniversary in 2004, and was called the \"world's best-selling car for much of this decade\" by The New York Times in 1998, outselling the Honda Accord and Ford Taurus. While the company had traditionally focused on durable plastic toys that allow children to use their imagination while at play, by 2004 it had introduced its Magicook Kitchen, which uses radio frequency devices to allow components to communicate with each other, such as having the stove respond when it recognizes that a piece of food is placed on it. On May 14th 2014, a Little Tikes \"Shady Jump n' Slide Bouncer\" went airborne due to a strong wind gust, injuring three children, two seriously."

  "text" : "Lefax was a company founded in 1910 by J. C. Parker in Philadelphia that produced a range of personal organisers. In its early days, the biggest customers were power plant engineers whose technical handbooks had grown too big to carry. In 1921, a London printer and stationery marketer, Norman & Hill Ltd., began importing the organizers, called Lefaxes. Several years later, they began to make the personal files under their Filofax brand. The Lefax trademark was registered 5 October 1926. Its use in the engineering industries was so pervasive that some journals were published in Lefax format. In the 1980s Lefax was bought out by London Wood Partners, a British firm, and in 1992 the company was acquired by its rival, Filofax. The original intention was that Lefax would be Filofax's top of the line range but the Lefax brand was eventually phased out."

The merger that gave rise to the company was not without opposition. The proposed merger initially received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey. The United States Justice Department approved the merger on January 25, 2010, with some conditions to which both parties agreed. However, in October 2009, the United Kingdom's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger. On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission reversed its decision and cleared the proposed merger."

Liberties Press received controversy in 2012 after it agreed to publish When We Dance by Melanie Verwoerd, after businessman Dave Kavanagh filed an injunction to keep the book from being released. Kavanagh alleged that he was defamed in the book, which covered Verwoerd's relationship with Irish radio and TV personality Gerry Ryan. The injunction was later withdrawn. In 2014 the publisher expanded its brick and mortar offices to include a bookstore that offers Liberties Press books and other sundries."

Lycatel, also a part of Lyca Group, serves its growing base of customers within expatriate and ethnic global niche segments that want to make high quality affordable international calls. Lycamobile sells international Pay-As-You-Go SIM cards to consumers wanting to make international telephone calls. An MVNO leases radio frequency from mobile phone network operators and it forms partnerships with the operators in each country it serves. Lycamobile has also developed distinct business structures such as MVNA arrangements in different countries. Lycamobile states that its focus remains quality and affordable international calling for its customers. It has often adopted an aggressive pricing strategy on entry to new markets in order to acquire early market share. In some instances, MNO partners of Lycamobile have been surprised by the actual growth rather than their own projected estimated growth of Lycamobile's products. In 2015 Lycamobile renewed a multi-year MVNO deal with O2 The Lycamobile brand concept was launched in 2005 with the first trading using the brand taking place in 2006. Its business structure is arranged to have local national private companies branded under licence as \"Lycamobile\" and operating exclusively in the particular country as either a MVNO provider or as the principal wholesaler of Lycamobile-branded products. Since its launch in the Netherlands in 2006, Lycamobile has more than 15 million Pay-As-You-Go customers worldwide."

All publications were put on indefinite hiatus until \"Animate\" acquired Biblos in the same year and renamed it \"Libre Publishing\".

Zero re-appeared in May 2008 under the name Kurofune Zero and the anthology B-Boy LUV became B-Boy Phoenix."

  "text" : "La Petite Boulangerie (\"The Little Bakery\") was an American bakery chain. Originally a two-store company owned by Food Resources Inc., it was purchased by PepsiCo in 1982 and franchised to various operators, including Food Resources in California and Arizona, and Calny, Inc. in the Seattle area. At its peak, La Petite Boulangerie had at least 140 locations, including Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, Sacramento, and a small number of bakeries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In August 1986, Food Resources sued PepsiCo, alleging that it was misled about La Petite Boulangerie's sales and profit potential of La Petite Boulangerie. Calny filed a similar lawsuit in March 1987. The Calny suit was resolved with PepsiCo's purchase of Calny in November 1987, which also gave it control of Calny's 142 west coast Taco Bell locations. The chain was purchased by Mrs. Fields Original Cookies, Inc. on March 31, 1987 for $15 million. The chain was then acquired by InterWest Partners in July 1993 with a goal of converting it to a chain of gourmet coffee-bakery cafes. The chain had 68 stores at this point, none of which were franchised. Java City purchased the chain from InterWest in May 1994. Cucina Holdings, Inc. acquired Java City in December 2000, but by the end of the month, La Petite Boulangerie was defunct."

  "text" : "Lucent Dossier Experience (whose name loosely translates to \"a collection of glowing light\") is a Los Angeles cirque style interactive, avant-garde circus, electronic rock band, performance troupe and entertainment company performing worldwide. The company's performances combine live original music and vocals with circus arts, dance, aerial arts and fire performance. The troupe has been described as a \"high-concept, steampunk-meets-neotribal performance ensemble\" and its immersive spectacles as a \"post-apocalyptic,\" \"exotic wonderland\". The company's headquarters are in the downtown fashion district of Los Angeles, California. Performers in Lucent's theatrical spectacles include singers, musicians, acrobats, aerial artists, stilt walkers, fire dancers, tribal belly dancers, a wide variety of other dancers (hip hop, burlesque, and Tahitian), spoken word poets, clowns, contortionists, elves, a bearded lady, a snake charmer/dancer, jugglers, and a sword swallower. Lucent Dossier's original music style creates a \"surreal soundtrack\" and has its base in electronica but uses live instruments to fill out the sound that include violins, sitars, guitars, drums, bass, hung, and more.Lucent Dossier Experience \"is recognized for their interactive, surrealistic performance that breaks barriers between them and the audience\". Over the years their original music has been produced by Dream Rockwell, Rick Alick and Super Tall Pall of Helios Jive, Chris Komashko, KRADDY, Atla Gadret, Metaphase, Nikita Sorkin, David Block, Stephan Jacobs, Maggie Lally, all under the collective Lucent Dossier Experience. Lucent's aerial performers use both traditional aerial apparatus such as trapeze, aerial silk, aerial hoop, span sets, aerial rope or Spanish web, as well as custom-made aerial apparatus unique to the group, including a large aerial moon, mechanical Lotus flower, bird cage, Star tetrahedron, spider web, straps (similar in effect to a straitjacket), and aerial carousel. Fire performers work with different styles of tools including fire staff, fire poi, fire fans, fire hoop, fire sword, fire knives, fire cups, fire rope, fire chains, aerial fire acts, and fire nunchaku. The interactive portions of Lucent's performances include oracle or tarot readings, rose water foot baths, gypsies offering herbal elixirs, a tribal temporary tattoo parlor, a \"Music Shack\" where songs are custom-written, Post Portal Post Office where lost letters are delivered from other dimensions and performed on the spot for guests, and a \"Transformation Station\" where audience members can receive fantasy hair and makeup applications. All the performers dress in fantastical costumes and makeup unique to Lucent Dossier. Their costuming often consists of recycled and found objects that might include the bones, wings, teeth and feathers of animals found dead either on the side of the road or in the forest. They are known for their custom body airbrush tattoo makeup, a look they originated in 2005. This tribal body art gives them their signature otherworldly, haute couture look."

  "text" : "LIME, an acronym for 'Landline, Internet, Mobile, Entertainment', was a communications provider owned by the British based Cable & Wireless Communications for its operations in Anguilla, Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines and Turks & Caicos in the Caribbean. The company formed from the integrated businesses of Cable & Wireless in the Caribbean which adopted the LIME name on 3 November 2008. LIME operates as the native incumbent telecommunications service providers in many of the islands where they reside. The company also operated mobile telecommunications under the bmobile brand from 2003 until rebranding them as LIME in 2008. Competitors include Digicel (largest mobile competitor). Cable & Wireless Communications, LIME's parent company also owns a 49% share in TSTT in Trinidad & Tobago and a 49% share in BaTelCo in The Bahamas. The company is the only authorized carrier licensed by Apple to sell iPhones under contract as well as being the only approved carrier for use (by Apple) in the English Speaking Caribbean. This was obtained in 2011 after Claro's exit from the Jamaican Market. In 2015, LIME's parent company, CWC acquired Columbus Communications and decided to adopt the brand name FLOW for its consumer-facing business. This meant that it would replace the name LIME. Currently, CWC no longer operates as LIME in any territory they used the brand in. The brand name, LIME, has been disused by CWC as of May 2016; heralding in the full branding of LIME to FLOW. The site now redirects to FLOW's page."

  "text" : "Lembrassa is a British lingerie and swimwear retailer founded in 2008 by Laura Cohen specifically to cater to women with larger breasts (D – J cup size). The debate over the \"size zero\" image and catwalk models has heated up recently with the announcement by Lynne Featherstone, the equalities minister, that she will convene a series of discussions in Autumn 2010 with the fashion industry, to discuss how to promote body confidence among young people. This has received much press coverage (e.g. Fashion industry faces airbrushing clampdown) and re-opened the debate about the treatment of \"real women\" and the hero worship of \"size zero\" catwalk models. Lembrassa founder, Laura Cohen, encountered the \"real women\" versus \"size zero\" issues before they became a popular movement and determined to do something about it. She started the company because in her own words \"I was fed up with the treatment I was getting when trying to buy larger cup size lingerie in store or even online. I felt frustrated with the high street retailers who were continually being 'out of stock' of my size.\" As well as founding Lembrassa, Laura has written a number of published articles on the issues facing larger-busted women including guidance on getting the right size bra when 80% of women have got it wrong. Lembrassa also follows its founder's belief in open marketplaces by having a single world-wide website and a single set of pricing. Customers from all over the world can purchase at the same sterling price. This approach is underlined by another of the founder’s articles \"The world is you local shop\". Lembrassa has attracted media interest for the difficulties small businesses face in getting start-up support \"Lembrassa aims for perfect fit\" and for its attention to customer service \"Frustration at Shop Ranges\"."

  "text" : "Lite Shipping Corporation, Danilo Lines, Sunline Shipping is a shipping line based in Cebu City, Philippines. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lirio Enterprises, Inc., a general trading firm doing business nationwide. It started as a shipping division of the mother company in the middle of 1988 when it bought two vessels - the MV Sto. Niño de Soledad, a 500-ton DWT capacity steel-hulled vessel and the MV Sto. Niño, a wooden hull 200-ton capacity vessel. Initially, the cargo loaded was mostly goods traded by Lirio Enterprises, Inc. like salt, rice, cement, fertilizers, sugar, etc. Sometimes they would accept other cargoes for backload when the occasion demands it. This shipping division was spun off as a separate shipping corporation in July 1989 when the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws of Lite Shipping Corporation. The Lite Shipping Corporation fleet consists of 15 roll-on/roll-off vessels, 12 passenger vessels and 3 cargo ships. In November 1991, the corporation acquired its third vessel, the MV St. Gabriel, a steel-hulled 30-ton capacity cargo boat due to the strong demand for the smaller cargo vessel in the trading operation of the mother company. In January 1992, the company expanded into the cargo/passenger shipping business with the purchase of a 175 gross tons roro car/truck carrier from the U.S. Navy, the LCT St. Mark. It has a capacity of four ten-wheeler cargo trucks, five cars and 50 to 70 passengers. It is the franchise holder for the Argao, Cebu to Loon, Bohol route as a daily car/truck ferry."

Notable vessels built by the company include the record-breaking Hudson River steamboat Chauncey Vibbard, the luxury Long Island Sound steamer Commonwealth, and the fast oceangoing steamships—later U.S. Navy gunboats—Bienville and De Soto. In addition to the domestic market, the company also built ships for service as far afield as South America and China. Lawrence & Foulks was one of the few New York shipyards to survive the post-Civil War slump, but was either unwilling or unable to make the postwar transition from wooden to iron shipbuilding, and closed its doors around the turn of the century."

Until the introduction of a logo in 1958, the corporation had relied on its coat of arms for official documentation and correspondence, although this crest rarely appeared onscreen. With the increased role of television for the BBC in the 1960s, particularly after the foundation of ITV, the corporation used its logo to increase viewer familiarity and to standardise their image and content. The logo has since been redesigned a number of times, most recently, in 1997, with the BBC blocks, a logo designed to work across media. From 1958, for this television network, there are five different logos. The first logo of network is used from 1958 to 1963, the second logo is used from 1963 to 1971, the third logo is used from 1971 to 1991, the fourth logo is used from 1988 to 1997, and the fifth and current logo is used from 1997."

The Agency Network developed quickly from its inception in 1811 and by the middle of the 19th century over three hundred Agents had been established worldwide. Today, the network comprises over 300 Lloyd’s Agents and a similar number of Sub Agents in every major port and commercial centre in the world. Their primary purpose is to provide a range of surveying and adjusting services to the global insurance market and its customers. To locate a Lloyd's Agent please visit the Lloyd's Agency Directory"

  "text" : "LIDAX is a space technology company, founded at the beginning of the year 2000. It designs and manufactures advanced mechanical equipments that form part of complex space flight systems and instruments for Earth observation (EarthCARE, Meteosat), planetary exploration (Exomars), astrophysics instrumentation (James Webb Space Telescope, BepiColombo, Plato, World Space Observatory) and telecom. The activities of the company encompass all aspects, from conceptual design, through integration and testing up to realization; both for satellite and on-ground instrumentation (OGSE & MGSE). Engineers and technicians represent practically the 90% of the company's personnel. LIDAX also owns a specialized laboratory called SMARTLAB for testing space mechanisms and subsystems. In the Smartlab, the performance of mechanisms can be measured under different environmental conditions, thus, measurement tests with optical metrology can be carried out under vacuum, cryogenic and high temperature environments. The company is headquartered in Paracuellos de Jarama, near Madrid-Barajas Airport, Spain. It operates next to the Spain's Space Agency Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA, English: National Institute of Aerospace Technology) and other known space industries such as EADS CASA Espacio. (part of Astrium) Since 2014, LIDAX forms part of SUMA Aerospace, a consortium set up with another three companies to become an internationally recognized organization for the design, manufacturing, commercialization and maintenance of electro-mechanical equipments for the aeronautic sector."

After the Second World War the factory was nationalised in the German Democratic Republic and produced electric locomotives for home use and for export, mainly to Communist Bloc countries under the name Lokomotivbau-Elektrotechnische Werke (LEW). After German reunification in 1990, the plant returned to AEG ownership, becoming AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH, and then passed through mergers of its parent companies to Adtranz (1996) and then Bombardier Transportation (2001). Under Adtranz's ownership production of locomotives ended, and the site now manufactures diesel and electric multiple units."

  "text" : "The Labourer's Friend Society was a society founded by Lord Shaftesbury in the United Kingdom in 1830 for the improvement of working class conditions. This included the promotion of allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the allotment movement, which the Society campaigned for after the Swing riots of 1830 as \"the most plausible remedy for the social problems of the countryside\". It published the Labourer's Friend Magazine, and in 1844 changed its title to the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes, becoming the first Model Dwellings Company in 1844. The Society received support from many influential figures of the time, including Montagu Burgoyne, Sir William Miles, Mary Ann Gilbert and Lord Ashley, who was the primary influence behind the transition of the Society into a more powerful body. The new Society had the patronage of Queen Victoria, the Prince Consort as president and Ashley as chairman. The company's architect was Henry Roberts, best known for Fishmongers' Hall in London. In 1959, the company became the 1830 Housing Society, which was taken over in 1965 by the Peabody Trust."

It operates under the Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Mission Directorate of NASA. Since 1990, NASA has purchased expendable launch vehicle (ELV) launch services directly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and applications missions. ELVs can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and altitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary missions. The Launch Services Program was established at Kennedy Space Center for NASA’s acquisition and program management of ELV missions. A NASA/contractor team is in place to meet the mission of the Launch Services Program, which exists to provide leadership, expertise and cost-effective services in the commercial arena to satisfy Agency wide space transportation requirements and maximize the opportunity for mission success. Primary launch sites are Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in California. Other launch locations are NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, Reagan Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska. In 2012, the program posted electronic copies of its brochure and poster."

On May 13, 2011, it was reported that they had demanded that a number of iOS application developers obtain licenses from them. Apple has written to Lodsys stating that Apple's licenses protect its app developers. However, Lodsys has decided to press on with their lawsuit and has sent a detailed legal response to Apple. According to the company website, Lodsys states that it is not a corporate subsidiary of patent holding company Intellectual Ventures, contrary to speculation from media sources."

Formed in Burscough in Lancashire in 2009, the company launched its educational portal at the annual BETT show at Olympia in London in January 2011. The company mission statement says it engages young learners by fusing education with existing interests in popular culture and video games. The Learnalot portal itself is continuously updated with new content of two different types – resources and games. In each resource the learner assumes the role of a character within a given scenario and is tasked with completing an overall objective that is broken down into three separate activities. Each activity focuses on different areas of the curriculum and each activity contributes to an overall score and grade for that resource. In order to achieve an A grade, the learner must master each of the three different activities and the skills that each demand. Both resources and games feature online leaderboards which encourage competition among users by periodically awarding prizes to those with the highest scores. Resource scenarios include saving mankind from extinction by establishing a colony on Mars, re-capturing convicts who have recently escaped from the local prison and ridding a haunted house of its unwelcome guests."

It also manufactures a variety of other alcoholic beverages including red wine and whiskey. Lotte soju is known by the brand name Chumchurum (hangul: 처음처럼).Chumchurum means \"like the first time\" (pure) in Korean. The symbol represents the name very well. The company added pictures of a Korean magpie and a bud. Korean magpie is known as a bird, who is bringing good news and bud refers to meaning of \"new\" and \"beginning\". Chumchurum is becoming popular to mostly women because it is softer than other alcohol. Chumchurum contains 19.5% of alcohol and it is made of alkali water, which makes soju become more distinct. Because of this, the company explains that it makes the soju taste better if you shake it well before drinking it – as in the commercial. Chumchurum is advertised by Korean famous singer Lee Hyori. From November 2012 the liquor is advertised by Hyuna, Hara & Hyorin. The company's current president is Jae Hyeok Lee."

  "text" : "Lucchini RS S.p.A. (formerly Lucchini Sidermeccanica S.p.A. and where the acronym \"RS\" stands for \"rolling stock\") is an Italian Company, fully owned by the Lucchini Family through a financial holding called Sinpar S.p.A. and divided from Gruppo Lucchini, which was under Russian control of Mr Mordashov and Severstal from 2005 till 2007. In 2008 the Lucchini's family took back the control of the company. Lucchini RS is specialized on high technology steel products such as railways products, steel casting, forgings, tool steels and forge ingots.The company operates according to ISO 9001-2008, International Railway Industry Standard IRIS and ISO 14001 certifications to guarantee to each customer the same standard of high quality. The company headquarters is in Brescia, but the main plant is located in Lovere (Bergamo) on the west shore of the Iseo Lake: the plant covers an area of 237,000 sqm including 147,000 sqm of factory buildings. Typical of this company is its ability to house on site all phases of production from the initial design to the finished products. The Lucchini RS Group is made of Lucchini RS SpA in Italy, the main plant, and four foreign subsidiaries: \n*  LUR (formerly known as Lucchini UK and JV between Lucchini RS and Unipart Rail) \n*  Lucchini Sweden \n*  Lucchini Poland \n*  Lucchini India \n*  Zhibo Lucchini (JV) \n*  Lucchini CE (Austria) \n*  LBX (Belgium) \n*  Lucchini CN (Beijing, China) In October 2007 Lucchini RS established a joint venture in China, Zhibo Lucchini Railway Equipment Ltd. This company is the Chinese market leader in the manufacturing of high speed railway wheels, axles and wheelsets. In 2010 the investment for a new railway rolling mill in Italy was completed and put into service. The expenditure was approximately €85 million. In 2013 Lucchini RS signed an agreement with Italcertifer – the certification company of FS Group (Ferrovie dello Stato Group) – that assign to Italcertifer the role of exclusive supplier in Italy of railway product test and certification. Moreover, thank to this agreement, Italcertifer became privileged supplier also for foreign countries, with the possibility of extending the collaboration with Lucchini RS European subsidiaries. On 27 June 2014, Lucchini RS acquired from the Tribunal of Liege a new company to manufacture railway products. The name of the new company is LBX SA. On 3 September 2014 Lucchini RS announced that it signed a preliminary agreement to acquire, by the end of 2014, 49% shareholding of Mamé Group, an important manufacturer of forged steel components based in Cividate Camuno (Brescia). Lucchini RS has a further option to acquire the majority of the group within 2017. From 2 February 2015 Lucchini RS and Unipart Rail create a new joint venture called LUR (Lucchini Unipart Rail Ltd). The new business will have an annual turnover of around £60m (about €75m) and employ over 300 people. Both production sites (Manchester and Doncaster) will remain. LUR focuses solely on the traction system of bogies, wheels and axels, wheelsets, gearboxes and final drivers. Lucchini RS holds 60% of LUR. On 10 June 2015 Antonio Mamè and Giuseppe Lucchini, respectively chairmen of Mamè Group SpA and Lucchini RS SpA, sign a definitive agreement with which Lucchini RS acquires 75% of a new company which will be composed by operative companies controlled by Mamè Group SpA. The company's name will be Lucchini Mamè Forge SpA. The chairman will be Antonio Mamè while the CEO will be Giuseppe Moschini (CEO of Mamè Group)."

  "text" : "Longchamps was a chain of several upscale restaurants centered in Manhattan that consisted of twenty or more locations at its peak, including the Showboat Restaurant located in the Empire State Building. The chain's first location was opened in 1919. Longchamps restaurants were known for their natty art deco furnishings and decorations by Winold Reiss, and a number of designs for elements of their physical surroundings were drawn up by New York architect Ely Jacques Kahn, originator of a colorful version of art deco architecture. In the early 1960s, Longchamps was the first – and perhaps the only – restaurant to introduce complementary Metrecal at luncheon, and was otherwise known for such specialties as Oxtail Ragout, Crabmeat a la Dewey, Nesselrode Pie, and \"21-Percent Butterfat Ice Cream\". A Longchamps in Washington D.C. was among the first tablecloth restaurants there to allow black customers. In 1959, restaurateur Jan Mitchell, the owner of Luchow's, became president and majority owner of the chain. In 1967, with a total of eight locations existing in Manhattan at that point, he sold a controlling stake to Murray and Irving Riese. Restaurateur Larry Ellman, owner of the Cattleman Restaurant, soon became partners with the Rieses and was named president of the chain. In 1971, the chain sold four of its remaining restaurants to the Riese Organization – also controlled by the Riese brothers – mostly removing it from the \"white tablecloth\" restaurant business, and a number of the old locations had been turned into steakhouse-themed outlets. In June 1975, the former parent company, Longchamps, Inc., filed for bankruptcy."

The alkali works was the first in England to make soda using the Leblanc process; the ironworks was the first to use Cleveland Ironstone, presaging the 1850s boom in ironmaking on Teesside. The so-called discoverer of Cleveland Ironstone, the mining engineer John Vaughan, ran a rolling mill for the company before leaving to found the major rival firm Bolckow Vaughan. The other key figure in the company was Lowthian Bell, son of Thomas Bell; he became perhaps the best known ironmaster in England. As Bell Brothers, the firm continued until 1931, when it was taken over by rival Dorman Long."

  "text" : "Los Angeles Pop Art (also known as LA Pop Art) is an American company, founded by Joseph Leibovic, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. The company creates text based artwork, entirely drawn by hand, also known as Micrography.By using entire movie scripts, complete song lyrics and manuscripts, Los Angeles Pop Art creates images out of the text that tell the story of that specific image. The portfolio of designs are used for the manufacture of a number of products, which include wall art, apparel, tote bags and aprons. These products are sold online in numerous stores as well as in traditional brick and mortar retailers. The portfolio is also licensed out to partner companies for the manufacture of a wide range of products that include everything from stickers to beach towels. In 1994 founder Joseph Leibovic was living in Israel when he stumbled upon the Micrography style of art while watching street artists, in the mystical town of Tzvat. The idea of Americanizing this style of art, by creating posters of classic films out of entire scripts, and music icons out of their legendary lyrics, was matured over the following 9 years. It wasn’t until Joseph moved back to Los Angeles, in 2004, that the idea was finally brought to life and Los Angeles Pop Art was founded. Los Angeles Pop Art has worked with some of the biggest names in music and film creating pieces for The Bob Marley Estate, Godfather, Rocky, Nirvana and many more A+ properties. The work developed at Los Angeles Pop Art has been featured in top magazines such as Playboy, Rolling Stone, Maxim and Stuff, as well as in top rated TV and films like Weeds, The Sopranos, The Girls Next Door, Workaholics and Battle: Los Angeles. Some of Los Angeles Pop Art’s original art is also included in major art collections and exhibits, such as The Ronald Reagan Presidential Art Collection and being included in The Amazing Collection at Ripley’s Believe it Or Not museums around the world."

  "text" : "La Mouette (English: Seagull) is a French aircraft manufacturer headquartered in Fontaine-lès-Dijon. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of hang gliders, paragliders and ultralight trikes. At one time they also produced paramotors. Founded in 1974 by brothers Gérard Thevenot and Jean-Marc Thevenot, the company was formed to produce versions of the American Seagull hang glider. Their glider was named La Mouette, after which the company was named. In 1979 they produced the La Mouette Atlas which remained in production through 2012 and of which there are over 8000 examples flying. In 1986 the company started building paramotors and in 1995 introduced the \"topless\" hang glider, deleting the kingpost and upper flying wires. In 2010-11 the company developed an electric aircraft, the Samson. The company also built a rigid wing hang glider, the Tsunami and a powered parachute, the Skydancer under the brand Helite. Helite is today a company that specializes in air bag designs."

The company was originally known as Coursekit, but changed its name to Lore in April 2012. The company rebranded in order to encompass adoption of the site by groups who learn and teach outside the traditional “course”. As of April 2012, the Lore network includes thousands of courses at over 600 colleges and universities, as well as classes created by student groups, bible study groups, and other organizations. Lore also employs over 100 college students to help encourage adoption of the site on their campuses. In March 2013 Lore announced it had been acquired by Noodle Education. Lore offers its learning platform for free, marketing it directly to professors. Lore’s main competitor is Blackboard, an online platform for courses that has dominated the Learning Management Systems market since the late 1990s. As of June 27th, 2016, Lore is no longer in operation."

They used a Continental 303.1 cubic inch inline six-cylinder engine. Some of the advanced features of the Power-Plus Six included a tilt and telescoping steering column, removable steering wheel (to be used as an anti-theft feature) and a directional signal/stop light box on the rear fender (with the control switch on the dashboard). Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Power-Plus Six was the pillarless \"California top\" that was a popular accessory for open touring cars in the 1920s. This top effectively made the car a \"hardtop,\" thirty years before the hardtop-convertible became a popular body style in the United States. Body styles included both two and four door models. Leach cars were high-priced for the day, and the company found itself in financial hot water by 1923. It closed its shutters in early 1924 after a grand total of about 250 cars (chassis with and without factory bodies) were produced."

  "text" : "Lazy 8 Studios is a small independent video game developer. It was founded by Rob Jagnow in 2008 and is based in San Francisco. Jagnow founded the company after spending some time in video game development on flight simulators. Jagnow soon brought aboard Brendan Mauro for art development and Luke Gilbert for sound and music. The company's first title was the 2009 Cogs, a steampunk-like puzzle game that Jagnow had envisioned for many years. The game was successful, nominated for several indie gaming awards and winning the 2010 \"Professional\" prize at the Indie Game Challenge. With the game's success, the team was invited by Valve Corporation to participate in the Potato Sack, an alternate reality game (ARG) that preceded the release of Valve's Portal 2. The challenge was to modify Cogs to meet the spirit of the game. Following Cogs, the company began work on a social game called Extrasolar, spurred by their participation in the Potato Sack ARG. Extrasolar plans to have players working with others to solve puzzles in an ARG-like environment, but without the real-time limitations required by most ARGs. Lazy 8 Studios was invited by Irrational Games to develop a browser-based tie-in puzzle game for their pending release of BioShock Infinite. It is titled BioShock Infinite: Industrial Revolution. Irrational had seen the studio's work on Cogs and felt the steampunk environment was a good match with the nature of their own game."

  "text" : "OAO Leningradslanets (Russian: ОАО «Ленинградсланец») was an oil-shale-mining company based in Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast, Russia. The main task of Leningradslanets was to supply oil shale for Zavod Slantsy. The company was established in 1934. At the same year, the Kirovskaya oil shale mine was opened. In 1941, during the World War II the company was evacuated to Kuibyshev Oblast (now: Samara Oblast) to process the Kashpirskoye and Savelyevskoye deposits. The company was transferred back to Slantsy in 1944. In 1947, the Mine No 1 was opened, followed by the Mine No 2 in 1949 and Mine No 3 in 1953. The Kirovskaya mine reopened in 1954. In 1970, mines No 1 and No 2 were merged to create the Leningradskaya Mine. In 1974, the Kashpirskaya oil shale mine near Syzran in the Volga region was merged into Leningradslanets. The Kirovskaya Mine was closed in 1988 and the Mine No3 was merged with the Leningradskaya Mine in 2003, which was closed in 2010. The company also planned to build a new Kirosvskaya Mine and Mezdureche open pit mine. In 2002, Leningradslanets produced 1.12 million tonnes of oil shale. After Zavod Slantsy stopped producing shale oil in 2003, oil shale was provided to Narva Power Plants until 2005. After supplies to Narva discontinued, Leningradslanets ceased its work until 2007 when the mining restarted. In 2009, it exported 40,000 tonnes of oil shale to VKG Oil. In 2006, it was announced that SK Group may buy the company; however, the deal was never agreed. In 2013, the company declared insolvency and was dissolved. At that time, more than 80% of shares of the company were controlled by Viktor Vekselberg's Renova Group."

  "text" : "The Liberia Cement Corporation, also known as Cemenco, is a major company in the economy of the Republic of Liberia. One of the oldest firms operating in the country in the early twenty-first century, it holds a monopoly on the sale of cement in the country. The firm's original factory was opened by President William V.S. Tubman in early January 1968. In the early 2010s, another firm announced its goal of entering the Liberian market, but by late 2012, no other companies were yet in the market. In response to this challenge, corporate officials announced in November 2012 their plans to erect a new manufacturing plant. Its previously existing facility is located on Bushrod Island in Monrovia, as is the site of the plant announced in November 2012; at that time, company bosses were planning to use a site formerly occupied by a manufacturing component of the defunct Mesurado Group of Companies. Historically, Cemenco has operated out of warehouses at the Freeport of Monrovia, but an ownership dispute over the warehouse property resulted in its conveyance to a Chinese firm in late 2012. In the mid-2000s, Cemenco was partially privately owned; its shares were divided among international firm Scancem, which owned 62% of the company; the Liberian government, with 29%; and other stockholders, who owned 9% of the company. Its monopoly status derives from a government decision in 1977, before the military coup that overthrew the country's government; at least one prominent Liberian has alleged that the monopoly status was a mechanism to enable political corruption by government officials who personally owned shares in the company. Liberia Cement has been the focus of environmental health complaints from those who live in nearby Monrovia neighborhoods, such as New Georgia and the Jamaica Road corridor. Residents have alleged that government officials have provided them no aid in fighting the company, which they say causes numerous childhood diseases because of the wide dissemination of the dust that its grinding process produces. In light of this difficulty, early plans for the plant announced in 2012 included the addition of pollution control equipment approved by the country's pollution control agency, and at the same time, observers noted reduced dust emissions from the existing plant. The firm's goals include achieving the ability to produce multiple types of cement, rather than continuing to import the product from other countries."

Billed by its organizers as the \"world's largest paint party\", the tour features performances by electronic musicians, joined by artistic performers and the tour's signature spraying of the audience with paint throughout the show. The company changed to its current name shortly after it was acquired by Robert F. X. Sillerman's SFX Entertainment in late 2012, with the original founders remaining as partners. Beginning in 2013, the promotion began to produce Life in Color Festival, a music festival with multiple stages and a larger lineup of performers. Life in Color's annual festival event in Miami is considered to be its flagship."

  "text" : "Linear Acoustic is an American company based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania that develops technology and manufacturers equipment used by television stations, cable television and satellite television services providers, post-production facilities and other content services providers to control, measure, manage and monitor multi-channel digital audio. The company has been especially active in areas related to automated upmixing and downmixing of multichannel broadcast audio, and with issues related to relative loudness of broadcast audio. The company was founded in 2002 by Tim Carroll, who had previously worked as Product Manager for the Professional Audio Division of Dolby Laboratories in San Francisco. While at Dolby, Carroll contributed to the development of Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby E encoding systems for DVD and high-definition television (HDTV) applications. Christina Carroll is the Vice President and Executive Director of Linear Acoustic and is responsible for managing day-to-day company operations. The company’s products can be broadly broken down into three categories: Loudness controllers designed to help television broadcasters maintain consistent audio levels; monitors and meters that measure digital audio levels, including loudness; and stand-alone encoding and transcoding products for handling the various data compression technologies commonly found in digital television plants. The subject of controlling loudness in television broadcasts has garnered considerable publicity since the FCC moved to implement enforcement of the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation or CALM Act on December 13, 2012. While consumer complaints about overly loud television commercials are almost as old as the medium itself, the CALM Act began as legislation was first sponsored by Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democratic congresswoman in California, in 2008. The law was passed in 2010 and went into full effect in 2011 and 2012. The Linear Acoustic AERO line of audio processors effectively measures and manages shifts in loudness and controls discrepancies between program and commercial audio without unnecessarily degrading the quality of the audio or significantly affecting the dynamic range that adds impact to digital television audio. When used in combination with a meter capable of measuring loudness by the ITU-R BS.1770 standard (or derivatives of this standard, such as EBU R128) U.S. broadcasters will be able to achieve CALM compliance by effectively managing and monitoring audio levels. Linear Acoustic also manufacturers the UPMAX 5.1-channel upmixer, which creates multi-channel surround sound audio from 2-channel (stereo) sources. NBC utilized this product during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and relied upon the company’s AERO.qc products during the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. In 2008, Linear Acoustic became part of The Telos Alliance, based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Telos Alliance comprises Telos Systems, Axia Audio, Omnia Audio, and 25-Seven Systems that manufacture broadcast telephone systems, consoles and audio over IP gear, audio processors, and audio time management hardware for radio stations. Frank Foti, founder of Omnia Audio, is The Telos Alliance CEO. At the 2012 NAB Show in Las Vegas, Linear Acoustic announced a co-branding agreement with Dolby Laboratories under which the company will manufacture stand-alone Dolby-centric professional products such as audio codecs and audio bitstream test tools."

  "text" : "Lulu (formerly Luluvise) is a mobile app available for iOS and Android that allows female users to make positive and negative evaluations of male users on the basis of their romantic, personal, and sexual appeal. The app allows only female users to access the evaluation system, and evaluations made through the app are attached publicly and anonymously. The New York Times described the service as a \"'Take Back the Internet' moment for young women who have come of age in an era of revenge porn and anonymous, possibly ominous suitors\". On 2015 the app moved away from Facebook, and currently only allows registration via mobile phone numbers, for both male and female users. Lulu describes itself as \"a private network for girls to express and share their opinions openly and honestly\" about the weaknesses and strengths of the manners, appearances, spending habits, and career ambitions of their male acquaintances. The company's expansion of its user base focuses heavily on recruiting undergraduate members of American all-female sororities, which commentators describe as reflected in the \"app's linguistic and visual design [which] is visibly influenced by US sorority culture.\" The app has been highly controversial, and the functionalities offered by the app are frequently described negatively in the popular press as \"sexist and objectifying\", \"nonconsensual\", and \"shallow and mean\". Although female users cannot write their own comments to avoid bullying, the company's harshest critics hold that the pre-selected terms used within the app for evaluations in the form of hashtags are instrumental in \"reinforcing completely horrible stereotypes\", accuse the site of tolerating a sexist double standard, and liken the \"candor\" for which the app aims to a form of public harassment. The company's founder, Alexandra Chong, refers to the app's functionalities as \"provocative\" and \"ground-breaking\" and the website holds that the multiple-choice nature of evaluations creates \"a safe and positive place for girls and guys\". The company has also been accused of inappropriate use of Facebook accounts' user data. Lulu does not query male Facebook users for their consent in integrating their profiles in the app, and at the time of its release the product caused notable social \"recoil\" and received significant negative coverage in the press for its violation of Facebook's policies on the use of user data. The company notes that its data collection policies are now in compliance with Facebook's Platform Policies. Also, it points out how users who have unwittingly been incorporated into Lulu's databases may contact their support center for the removal of their personal data. Lulu was sold to Badoo in 2016."

Lewis produced the Bronx leather jacket, one of the first products aimed directly at the post-war teenage fashion market, which was widely adopted by the Ton-up Boys and Rockers of the 1960s, becoming associated with the 59 Club and sponsoring leading motorcycle and TT racers of the day."

The site had over one million users when it was shut down by the United States government. Prosecutors argued that due to lax security, alleged criminal activity largely went undetected, which ultimately led to them seizing the service. In May 2013, Liberty Reserve was shut down by United States federal prosecutors under the Patriot Act after an investigation by authorities across 17 countries. The United States charged founder Arthur Budovsky and six others with money laundering and operating an unlicensed financial transaction company. Liberty Reserve is alleged to have been used to launder more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds during its history."

Its coffee is also available in other local coffee shops. There had previously been a location near PPG Place. It offers organic options and is fair trade certified. As of 2008, it had remained the only such coffee roaster in Pittsburgh. Owner Sam Patti opened La Prima on October 1, 1988. It also sells and repairs coffee equipment. In 2008, Patti opened Crêpes Napoleon and Josephine, a cafe with seating for 35, at 2107 Penn Avenue in the Strip District.

  "text" : "Lone Signal's message consists of two key components, a background hailing component and a more complex message component. The hailing component, designed by planetary scientist Michael W. Busch, uses a universal binary encoding system, which goes through an octal intermediary, representing numbers, mathematical operators, or other symbols. Each value corresponds to a single unique frequency. The offsets between those frequencies are set to be much larger than the bit rate (i.e. if transmitting at 100 Hz, the offsets between adjacent frequencies will be ~300 Hz). Using these code blocks, coherent mathematical statements about the laws of physics and Earth's location in the galaxy are produced. The hailing message repeats on average three times in order to allow the recipient to decode it at any time when observation begins, with some parts repeating more often than others. The hailing component was designed to be easily decoded by an extraterrestrial civilization, which was confirmed by a double-blind experiment. The hailing component is not an end in itself, but is designed to be a \"Rosetta Stone\" toward understanding the more complex message component, consisting of brief, 144-character statements by the general public. These messages, with widely varying languages and contents, are posted from the Lone Signal website. Individuals who have signed up to send messages with Lone Signal, collectively known as the \"beaming community\", are permitted to send one message for free, and thereafter are required to purchase \"message credits\" in order to fund the operation of the project. The content of messages sent via Lone Signal may be syndicated to the Twitter and Facebook accounts of beaming community members as desired. It is in this beaming community user space that an attempt is being made to extend the syntax used in the hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, is nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message."

In May 2013 it was part of a joint venture which won the EUR22bn contract to construct a third international airport in Istanbul. It had previously been part of a joint venture which in 2007 won a 20-year concession to operate Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, and in 2007, together with French firm Aéroport de Lyon, won the concession tender for Pristina International Airport. Other projects include the Yusufeli Dam. In July 2013 it was part of a joint venture which acquired the daily newspaper Akşam, together with TV channel Sky Turk 360 and radio station Alem FM, for TL60m. Limak was launched in 1976 by Sezai Bacaksız and Nihat Özdemir, with Özdemir focussing on cement and energy while Bacaksız focussed on airports and tourism. In December 2013 Nihat Özdemir was among the 41 suspects who were issued arrest orders in the second corruption probe. « Prosecutors also appear to be targeting construction companies involved in some of the government’s showpiece infrastructure projects. Those named in media reports included Nihat Ozdemir, head of Limak group, part of a consortium that won the €22bn tender to build Istanbul’s third airport ». In 2011 Özdemir and Bacaksız were listed as billionaires by Forbes."

At the height of the Cold War, L·Garde developed and manufactured inflatable targets and decoy systems for U.S. military defense, and countermeasure systems for the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars). After the Cold-War, the company used the technologies and manufacturing techniques it had developed to land a contract to design and build the inflatable antenna experiment and other thin-film inflatable space structures using its unique application of rigidizable tube technology.The company's unusual name is an acronym formed by the initials of the founding partners: Bill Larkin, Gayle Bilyeu, Alan Hirasuna, Rich Walstrom, Don Davis. The \"E\" comes from the Latin term \"et al\" (and others) as a tip to other partners and original employees of the company."

Music files used to construct remixes must be exact matches to the ones legally sold through Legitmix.

Libramatic officially launched in July 2012 at a startup event in Dublin. By utilising a correlation of multiple online data sources, it searches for information on that book using an undisclosed algorithm and stores it allowing librarians to circulate books based on an ISBN. The use of online library management systems has increased drastically since the rise of \"cloud\" technology. Many modern cloud-based solutions now allow automated cataloging by scanning a book's ISBN. This technology was pioneered by Libramatic, although it is currently in use by systems such as LibraryWorld."

  "text" : "LiftDNA is a display advertising Yield Optimization / Supply Side Platform (SSP) that was acquired by OpenX on February 26, 2012  for tens of millions. LiftDNA was the first SSP to build a RTB enabled yield optimization company that was directly integrated into Google's Doubleclick and OpenX (company)'s adservers, the two largest publisher adservers in the market. Its approach differed from existing SSP's (Rubicon Project, Admeld and Pubmatic) by leveraging Google and OpenX's adserver API. Instead of rebuilding an adserver from scratch, LiftDNA was able to leverage a publisher's existing platform and make accurate yield decisions with the added benefit of seeing all data and pricing within a publisher's adserver, rather than the partial view other SSP's had (only traffic redirected to SSP for optimization). The LiftDNA core technology solution enabled accurate impression and user level pricing for blind tag-based network demand which fed RTB / exchanges to bid accurately in the adserver. \"Predictive Pricing\" was a breakthrough that enabled publishers to host super auctions within their ad servers, with real-time bidders and traditional ad networks competing simultaneously for impressions the moment an ad call occurs. All of LiftDNA publisher clients came from existing SSP, where they subsequently saw revenue increases ranging from 50-150%. LiftDNA was founded by Vadim Telyatnikov (former Director of Yield Operations at myYearBook) and Kingchih Fan. LiftDNA grew to 30 employees across three offices with gross revenues exceeding $10 million in 2011 before being approached by OpenX, early 2012. LiftDNA no longer exists as a standalone product / service. It is now integrated into OpenX Market + SSP."

Her Chee Industrial Co Ltd is commonly known for the manufacturing of parts for brands like Can-Am and Arctic Cat. Like most companies in the market the manufacturing takes place in Taiwan. Final assembly is in the Netherlands. LandFighter offers different types of vehicles in the field of ATVs and Side by Sides, the vehicles are European approved and are allowed on the road within the European Union. LandFighter makes use of branded components such as 50 hp Subaru Fuji Heavy Industries engine and a 42.2 hp SYM engine, NGK spark plug and Maxxis tires. The vehicles are tested on surfaces covered in snow and mud. In December 2013 the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property had to judge on a brand infringement objection by Land Rover against LandFighter, asking for an examination whether there is too much similarity between the word LAND ROVER and Logo and brand name of LandFighter, both verbal and visual elements were included. The conclusion of the BOIP is that the brands have merely the descriptive word element 'Land' in common. The Benelux Office for Intellectual Property therefore announced that the differences between the mark and the sign, as the added visual elements and the use of colors and the differences between the dominant verbal elements were sufficient to neutralize. The similarities were too small and there was no risk of confusion. The opposition was rejected."

The service is integrated with multiple rail operators, including ATOC in the United Kingdom, SNCF in France, Deutsche Bahn in Germany, Renfe in Spain and both Italo and Trenitalia in Italy. The company sells fares for all major high-speed rail services in Europe, such as TGV, ICE, Eurostar, AVE, Thalys, Frecciarossa, and Italo. Founded in 2006, Loco2 is headquartered in London. The company's name is both an abbreviation of the phrase \"low CO2\" as well as a reference to locomotive travel. A 2014 Business Traveler article about Loco2 noted that booking rail tickets directly through Europe's rail operators often leads to inconsistent user experiences including credit card rejection issues, limited access to discount fares, and complicated navigation experiences. A similar TechCrunch article characterized the booking systems as \"fiendishly complex.\" Loco2 promotes train travel as a low carbon alternative to air travel, due to rail travel's ability to reduce a traveller's carbon footprint by up to 90 percent. The company's stated mission is to \"make booking a train as easy as booking a flight.\""

  "text" : "Lolly Wolly Doodle is an American company that manufactures women's and children's clothing for sale online. It was founded in 2008 by Brandi Temple in her hometown of Lexington, North Carolina, where it is headquartered. After investments by venture capitalists such as Revolution Growth, it has expanded to include production facilities in New York City; some business is outsourced to China and Latin America. While it is not its only channel, Lolly Wolly Doodle sells most of its products through its Facebook page. Temple claims the company is the largest business on that site. It is considered to have succeeded in using Facebook as a sales platform where many larger, established retailers had failed. The company takes a fast fashion approach to product development and production. Since it offers custom services like monogramming, it uses just-in-time production; its workers have been compared to short-order cooks. The network effects of distributing through a prominent social media site eliminate the need to spend money on marketing or advertising."

  "text" : "Let-Mont s.r.o. was a Czech aircraft manufacturer based in Vikýřovice. The company specialized in the design and manufacture of kit aircraft. The company's two designs, the Tulak and the Piper UL, were based upon 1940s and 1950s Piper Aircraft models. The company appears to have gone out of business in the mid-2000s period. Both aircraft models offered were designed to comply with the European Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category and were sold ready-to-fly. They were also marketed in the United States as kits for the US homebuilt category, although it seems that none were ever constructed or flown in the US."

This model factors short- and long-term potential income, degree, and job stability, in addition to standard underwriting criteria such as FICO scores."

  "text" : "Le Courrier de Floride is a free monthly French-speaking newspaper in Florida, on paper and on internet, founded in 2013 by Gwendal Gauthier. Hard copies of the newspaper are distributed in French stores, at consulates, and in schools, in Florida. The first issue of the journal included an exclusive interview with the Consul général de France à Miami, Gaël de Maisonneuve, who was just leaving. And it has included interviews of other French officials: the new consul of France in Miami, the consul of Canada in Miami, and the first interview of the new ambassador of France to the United States. An interview published at the French consul's website notes that it had been a long time since any French newspaper appeared at a local level in the United States, perhaps not since French-language newspapers in Louisiana ceased publishing in the early 1900s. L’Abeille de la Nouvelle-Orléans (The New Orleans Bee), which published from 1827 to 1923, has been reported to be the last French-language newspaper of New Orleans. The newspaper serves a large population (approximately three million) of French-speaking inhabitants and visitors in Florida, including expatriates and immigrants from Haiti and other countries, and numerous French-Canadian Snowbird visitors during the six cold months in Québec, with many of the snowbirds staying in Broward County communities of Hollywood, Hallandale, Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale. French is now the third most widely spoken language in Florida, after English and Spanish, with approximately 500,000 residents in the 2010 census speaking French or French Creole (mostly Haitian Creole) as their first language. Back in 2003, Florida became the state or province having the second-greatest number of French-speakers, behind only Quebec, passing Ontario. 36% of all French Creole speakers in the U.S., and 4% of all French speakers, lived in Miami in 2007."

Lorcin produced a series of very inexpensive handguns, which were sold primarily through pawn shops and marketed towards people with low income. As such, their guns were frequently referred to as saturday night specials, and Lorcin was noted by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as one of the Ring of Fire companies (a series of companies established around Los Angeles, California, all of which manufactured inexpensive handguns of similar design and all of which were connected to Raven Arms. Waldorf was a high school friend of Bruce Jennings, founder of Raven Arms. The guns were constructed of injection-molded Zamak, a zinc alloy. In 1993, Lorcin was the number one pistol manufacturer in the United States, producing 341,243 guns. However, in 1996, Lorcin filed for bankruptcy, with 18 pending product liability, personal injury, and wrongful death lawsuits. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1997, but went out of business permanently in 1998 with an additional 22 lawsuits having been filed."

LeadGenius is the first crowdsourcing company to set a minimum wage for its workers tied to the cost of living in the country they are working in. The company launched in Y Combinator’s Summer 2011 class under the name MobileWorks. It has since raised $6 million in venture funding from investors such as Sierra Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Alexis Ohanian, Mitch Kapor, Dave McClure, and Sam Altman."
