  "text" : "(For other uses, see Hudson's Bay (disambiguation).) The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC; French: Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson), commonly referred to as The Bay (La Baie in French), is a Canadian retail business group. A fur trading business for much of its existence, Hudson's Bay Company now owns and operates retail stores throughout Canada, Germany, Belgium and the United States with Galeria Kaufhof, Gilt, Hudson's Bay, Home Outfitters, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH. HBC's head office is in the Simpson Tower in Toronto, Ontario. The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"HBC\". The company was incorporated by English royal charter in 1670 as The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay and functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America before European states and later the United States laid claim to some of those territories. It was once the world's largest landowner, with the area of the Hudson Bay watershed, known as Rupert's Land, having 15% of North American acreage. From its long-time headquarters at York Factory on Hudson Bay, the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English and later British controlled North America for several centuries. Undertaking early exploration, its traders and trappers forged relationships with many groups of aboriginal peoples. Its network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States. In the late 19th century, with its signing of the Deed of Surrender, its vast territory became the largest portion of the newly formed Dominion of Canada, in which the company was the largest private landowner. By the mid-19th century, the company evolved into a mercantile business selling everything from furs to fine homeware. They \"quickly introduced a new type of client to the HBC – one that shopped for pleasure and not with skins\"; the retail era had begun as the HBC began establishing stores across the country. In July 2008 HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners, who also owns U.S. luxury department store Lord & Taylor. From 2008 to 2012, the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC, Hudson's Bay Trading Company, which was dissolved on 23 January 2012. Since 2012, the HBC directly oversees its Canadian subsidiaries Hudson's Bay (formerly The Bay) and Home Outfitters, in addition the operations of Lord & Taylor in the United States. On 29 July 2013, the HBC announced its takeover of Saks, Inc., operator of upmarket American department store operator Saks Fifth Avenue. The merger was completed on 3 November 2013. In September 2015, HBC acquired German department store chain Galeria Kaufhof and its Belgian subsidiary from Metro Group for $3.2 billion U.S. In May 2016, HBC announced it would expand to the Netherlands by taking over up to 20 former Vroom & Dreesmann sites by 2017. V&D was a historic Dutch department store chain that went bankrupt and shut down in early 2016. HBC said the expansion would cost CAD $340 million and create 2,500 jobs in the stores and another 2,500 temporary construction jobs. The Dutch stores would operate under the \"Hudson's Bay\" and \"Saks Off Fifth\" brands. In January 2016 HBC announced that it would also expand deeper in the digital space with its acquisition of online flash sales site, the Gilt Groupe, for U.S. $250 million."

  "text" : "GM Holden Ltd, generally known as Holden, is an Australian automobile manufacturer that operates in Australia and is headquartered in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The company was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer in South Australia. In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, before becoming a subsidiary of the United States-based General Motors (GM) in 1931. After becoming a subsidiary of GM, the company was named General Motors-Holden's Ltd, becoming Holden Ltd in 1998—the current name was adopted in 2005. Holden is responsible for GM vehicle operations in Australia, and on their behalf, held partial ownership of GM Daewoo in South Korea between 2002 and 2009. Holden has offered a broad range of locally produced vehicles, supplemented by imported GM models. Holden has offered the following badge engineered models in sharing arrangements: Chevrolet, Isuzu, Nissan, Opel, Suzuki, Toyota and Vauxhall Motors. As of 2013, the vehicle lineup consists of models from GM Korea, GM Thailand, GM in the US, and self-developed Commodore, Caprice, and Ute. Holden also distributed the European Opel brand in Australia in 2012 until the brand's Australian demise in mid-2013. All Australian-built Holden vehicles are manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, and engines are produced at the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland states of Australia, with GM's New Zealand subsidiary Holden New Zealand operating a plant until 1990. The consolidation of car production at Elizabeth was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until 1994. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia have led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. On 11 December 2013, Holden announced that it will cease vehicle and engine production by the end of 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing. In the last few years, Holden incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, with government grants being reduced in future. In May 2014 GM reversed their decision to abandon the Lang Lang Proving Ground and have decided to keep it as part of their engineering capability in Australia."

Honda has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959, as well as the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million internal combustion engines each year. Honda became the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001. Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world behind General Motors, Volkswagen Group, Toyota, Hyundai Motor Group, Ford, Nissan, and PSA Peugeot Citroën in 2011. Honda was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura, in 1986. Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft and power generators, and other products. Since 1986, Honda has been involved with artificial intelligence/robotics research and released their ASIMO robot in 2000. They have also ventured into aerospace with the establishment of GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004 and the Honda HA-420 HondaJet, which began production in 2012. Honda has three joint-ventures in China (Honda China, Dongfeng Honda, and Guangqi Honda). In 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues in research and development. Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter to the United States, exporting 108,705 Honda and Acura models, while importing only 88,357."

Noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style, Harley-Davidson traditionally marketed heavyweight, air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than 700 cm³ — and has broadened its offerings to include its more contemporary VRSC (2002) and middle-weight Street (2015) platforms. Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Manaus, Brazil; and Bawal, India — and markets its products worldwide. Besides motorcycles, the company licenses and markets merchandise under the Harley-Davidson brand, among them being apparel, home decor and ornaments, accessories, toys and scale figures of motorcycles, and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community."

The Heckler & Koch Group comprises Heckler & Koch GmbH, Heckler & Koch Defense, NSAF Ltd., and Heckler & Koch France SAS. The company motto is \"Keine Kompromisse!\" (No Compromise!). HK provides firearms for many military and paramilitary units, like the SAS, KMar, the US Navy Seals, Delta Force, HRT, the German KSK and GSG 9 and many other counter-terrorist and hostage rescue teams. Their products include the MP5 SMG, the G3 battle rifle, the HK33, G36, HK416 assault rifles, the Heckler & Koch HK21 general-purpose machine gun, the MP7 PDW, the UMP SMG, the USP series of handguns, and the high-precision PSG1 sniper rifle. All firearms made by HK are named by a prefix and the official designation, with suffixes used for variants. HK has a history of innovation in firearms, such as the use of polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern polygonal rifling, noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned G11 military rifle, which fired caseless high-velocity ammunition). In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and gas operation (via Short-stroke piston)."

  "text" : "Hummer was a brand of trucks and SUVs, first marketed in 1992 when AM General began selling a civilian version of the M998 Humvee. In 1998, General Motors (GM) purchased the brand name and marketed three vehicles: the original Hummer H1, based on the military Humvee, as well as the H2 and H3 models that were based on smaller, civilian-market GM platforms. By 2008, Hummer's viability in the economic downturn was being questioned, and it was placed under review by GM management. Rather than being transferred to Motors Liquidation Company as part of the GM bankruptcy in 2009, the brand was retained by GM, in order to investigate its sale. In 2009, a Chinese manufacturer, Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company, announced that it would acquire Hummer, pending government approvals, but later withdrew its bid. On February 24, 2010, Reuters reported that the Chinese ministry of commerce had prevented the deal, although a ministry spokesperson denied rejecting the application, which had been stalled for eight months. At the end of February, General Motors announced it would begin dismantling the Hummer brand. Although the automaker announced two days later that it had been approached with new offers, by April 2010, any sale became unlikely, as inventory was depleted and Hummer dealerships began shutting down. After filling a rental-car fleet order, the last Hummer H3 rolled off the line at Shreveport on May 24, 2010. The original maker of Hummer, AM General, lost their bid to build the HMMWV's replacement for the U.S. military in 2015."

  "text" : "Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc. (simply known as Hanna-Barbera and also referred to as H-B Enterprises, H-B Production Company and Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) was an American animation studio that dominated American television animation for three decades in the mid-to-late 20th century. It was founded in 1957 by former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (creators of Tom and Jerry) and live-action director George Sidney in partnership with Screen Gems, the television arm of Columbia Pictures. Sold to Taft Broadcasting in late 1966, it spent two decades as its subsidiary. Hanna-Barbera was known not only for its characters, but building upon and popularizing the concepts and uses of limited animation. Over 30 years, successful hit cartoons were produced, including The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, The Jetsons, Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo and The Smurfs. For their achievements, Hanna and Barbera together won seven Academy Awards, eight Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Hanna-Barbera's fortunes declined in the mid-1980s when the profitability of Saturday morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication. In late 1991, the studio was purchased from Taft (by then named Great American Broadcasting) by Turner Broadcasting System (Ted Turner's company), who used much of its back catalog to program its new TV channel, Cartoon Network. After Turner purchased the company, Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as creative consultants and mentors. Turner merged with Time Warner in 1996 and the studio became a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Animation, into which Hanna-Barbera was absorbed after Hanna died in 2001. Cartoon Network Studios continued the projects for the channel's output. Barbera went on to work for Warner Bros. Animation until his death in 2006. As of 2016, the studio exists as an in-name-only unit used to market properties and productions associated with the Hanna-Barbera library, specifically its \"classic\" works. In 2005, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences honored Hanna and Barbera with a bronze wall sculpture of themselves and their characters."

  "text" : "Hammer Films or Hammer Pictures is a British film production company based in London. Founded in 1934, the company is best known for a series of Gothic \"Hammer Horror\" films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s. Hammer also produced science fiction, thrillers, film noir and comedies — and, in later years, television series. During its most successful years, Hammer dominated the horror film market, enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success. This success was due, in part, to distribution partnerships with major United States studios, such as Warner Bros. During the late 1960s and 1970s the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer formula, with varying degrees of success. The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s. In 2000, the studio was bought by a consortium including advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi and publishing millionaires Neil Mendoza and William Sieghart. The company announced plans to begin making films again after this, but none were produced. In May 2007, the company was sold again, this time to a consortium headed by Dutch media tycoon John de Mol, who announced plans to spend some $50m (£25m) on new horror films. The new owners also acquired the Hammer group's film library, consisting of 295 movies. Simon Oakes, who took over as CEO of Hammer, said: \"Hammer is a great British brand — we intend to take it back into production and develop its global potential. The brand is still alive but no one has invested in it for a long time\". Since then it has produced the feature films Let Me In (2010), The Resident (2011) and The Woman in Black (2012)."

  "text" : "Honeywell International, Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate company that produces a variety of commercial and consumer products, engineering services and aerospace systems for a wide variety of customers, from private consumers to major corporations and governments. The company operates three business units, known as Strategic Business Units – Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation and Control Solutions, and Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies. Honeywell is a Fortune 100 company. In 2016, Honeywell ranked 75th in the Fortune 500. Honeywell has a global workforce of approximately 130,000, of whom approximately 58,000 are employed in the United States. The company is headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey. Its current chief executive officer is David M. Cote. The company and its corporate predecessors were part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index from December 7, 1925 until February 9, 2008. The company's current name, Honeywell International Inc., is the product of a merger in which Honeywell Inc. was acquired by the much larger AlliedSignal in 1999. The company headquarters were consolidated with AlliedSignal's headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey; however the combined company chose the name \"Honeywell\" because of its superior brand recognition. In 2015, the headquarters were moved to Morris Plains. Honeywell has many brands that commercial and retail consumers may recognize, including its line of home thermostats (particularly the iconic round type) and Garrett turbochargers. In addition to consumer home products Honeywell itself produces, such as thermostats, sensors, security alarm systems, and air cleaners and dehumidifiers, the company also licenses its brand name for use in various retail products made by partner manufacturers such as air conditioners, heaters, fans, security safes, home generators, and paper shredders."

  "text" : "The Henry Ford Company was the second company for Henry Ford, founded November, 1901. It resulted from the reorganization of the Detroit Automobile Company, his first unsuccessful attempt at automobile manufacture a year before. In March 1902, Ford left the company following a dispute with his financial backers, William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen, as Mr. Ford was devoting considerable time to the sport of auto racing and his Ford 999 race car. In a final settlement, Ford left with his name and USD $900; he went on to start the Ford Motor Company in 1903 at the Ford Mack Avenue Plant. In August 1902, Henry M. Leland was brought in by the investors to appraise the plant and equipment prior to selling them. Instead, Leland persuaded them to continue in the automobile business. The Henry Ford Company reorganized that year as Cadillac in honor of Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, the founder of Detroit. Cadillac's first car was completed on October 17, 1902, the 10 horsepower (7 kW) Cadillac. Based on Henry Ford's design (except for the engine, designed by Leland & Faulconer), it was practically identical to the 1903 Ford Model A. Located in Detroit at the intersection of Cass Avenue and Amsterdam Street, the original manufacturing plant was designed by architectural firm George C. Mason & Son, and remained in operation under Cadillac until 1921, when the Detroit Assembly factory was built at Clark Street. The factory after Mr. Leland made some improvements, was 275,000 square feet, with its own forge, a machine shop, and a foundry for both iron and brass. The factory ran 24 hours a day, producing 40 Cadillacs in that time period. It is approximately 2 miles east of the current Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly, where Cadillacs are currently built. It is approximately half a mile southwest from Cadillac Place, GM's headquarters from 1922 until 2001, when GM moved to the GM Renaissance Center next to the Detroit River."

Flagship downtown stores are located in Canada's largest cities, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg, often being multi-storey, historic buildings and carry an extensive range and selection of goods than regular Hudson's Bay stores. The largest of the flagship stores is the Toronto store on Queen Street, at about 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2).

  "text" : "Halifax (previously known as Halifax Building Society) is a British bank operating as a trading division of Bank of Scotland, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group. It is the UK's largest provider of residential mortgages and savings accounts and came 5th overall in the British Bank Awards 2016. It is named after the town of Halifax, West Yorkshire where it was founded as a building society in 1853. By 1913 It had developed into the UK's largest building society and continued to grow and prosper and maintained this position within the UK until 1997 when it demutualised. In 1997 it became Halifax plc, a public limited company which was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 2001 Halifax plc merged with The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland, forming HBOS. In 2006, the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 legally transferred the assets and liabilities of the Halifax chain to Bank of Scotland which became a standard plc, with Halifax becoming a division of Bank of Scotland. A takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB was approved by the Court of Session on 12 January 2009, and on 19 January 2009 Bank of Scotland, including Halifax, formally became part of Lloyds Banking Group."

  "text" : "Hapag-Lloyd is a German transportation company comprising a cargo container shipping line, Hapag-Lloyd AG, which in turn owned other subsidiaries such as Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. Hapag-Lloyd AG is the world's fifth largest container carrier in terms of vessel capacity. The company was formed in 1970 as a merger of two 19th-century companies, Hapag, which dated from 1847, and Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) or North German Lloyd (NGL), which was formed in 1856. Hapag-Lloyd was acquired in 1998 by TUI AG (Hanover) and became its fully owned subsidiary in 2002. In 2009, TUI sold a majority stake to a group of private investors and the City of Hamburg, the so-called Albert Ballin Consortium. The main founders of Hapag and Lloyd in the 19th century were Berenberg Bank, Fritz Albert Haas, and H. J. Merck & Co.. In February 2012 the German company TUI sold more shares of the German owned company Hapag-Lloyd to the City of Hamburg which is the largest share holder with approx. 37% followed by Kuehne Maritime with 28% and TUI AG with 22%. The other shareholders are Hamburg based banks and insurances. In 2013 Hapag-Lloyd and CSAV started merger talks which ended in Hapag-Lloyd taking over the container business of Chile's CSAV in December 2014. In exchange for contributing its container business CSAV received 30% of the shares in the enlarged Hapag-Lloyd company. After a capital increase by CSAV and Kühne Maritime in December 2014 the actual owners of Hapag-Lloyd are CSAV (34%), the City of Hamburg (23.2%), Kühne Maritime (20.8%), TUI (13.9%), Signal Iduna (3.3%), HSH Nordbank (1.8%), an investor pool led by the Hamburg-based private bank M.M.Warburg & CO (1.8%) and HanseMerkur (1.1%). The integration of the CSAV container business into Hapag-Lloyd was concluded in 2015 making Hapag-Lloyd one of the market leaders in the Latin American markets besides its already existing leading position on the North Atlantic."

In 1959 it was granted a Royal Charter and renamed \"The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club\" (英皇御准香港賽馬會). The name of the institution was reverted to its original name in 1996 due to the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. Membership of the club is by nomination and election only. It is a non-profit organisation providing horse racing, sporting and betting entertainment in Hong Kong. It holds a government-granted monopoly in providing pari-mutuel betting on horse racing, the Mark Six lottery, and fixed odds betting on overseas football events. The organisation is the largest taxpayer in Hong Kong, as well as the largest community benefactor. The HK Jockey Charities Trust donated a record HK$3.6 billion in 2014 to support the different needs of the society and contribute to the betterment of Hong Kong. The Club also proactively identifies, funds and develops projects which anticipate and address social issues and pressing needs in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Jockey Club also provides dining, social, sport and recreation facilities to its approximately 23,000 members."

The head office was originally based in the Montreal borough of Anjou but moved to Laval, Quebec, a northern suburb of Montreal, in early 2006. The company operates 60 stores across Canada, branded as Hart, primarily in smaller and suburban markets. Before running into financial difficulties in 2011, the chain had 92 stores under the Hart and Bargain Giant banners, extending as far east as Newfoundland. The average store is approximately 2,000 - 5,000 m2. The company positions itself within the market as a niche marketer. The target customer is low to average consumers. Hart's pricing strategy is to implement both everyday low prices as well as the high/low strategy. The company does not emphasize a private label within their stores."

It operates intercity rail services in Hokkaido, Japan. The company introduced Kitaca, a smart card ticketing system, from autumn 2008. At the time of its privatization in 1987, JR Hokkaido operated 21 railway lines totalling 3,176.6 kilometres (1,973.8 mi) of narrow-gauge (1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in)) track, as well as a ferry service to Aomori. Since then, that number has dwindled to just below 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi), as unprofitable lines have been shut down or spun off (in the case of the Hokkaidō Chihoku Kōgen Railway). The ferry service has also been replaced by the Seikan Tunnel. Hokkaido Railway's headquarters are in Chūō-ku, Sapporo."

  "text" : "Hyundai Group (Hangul: 현대그룹; hanja: 現代그룹; /ˈhjʌndɛ/) was a multinational chaebol (conglomerate) headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. It was founded by Chung Ju-yung in 1947 as a construction firm and Chung was directly in control of the company until his death in 2001. Following the 1997 East Asian financial crisis and Chung's death, Hyundai underwent a major restructuring and break-up, which reduced the Hyundai Group's business to encompass only container shipping services, the manufacturing of elevators, and tourism. Today, most companies bearing the name Hyundai are not legally connected to Hyundai Group. They include Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai Department Store Group, Hyundai Heavy Industries Group and Hyundai Development Company. However, most of the former subsidiaries of the Hyundai conglomerate continue to be run by relatives of Chung. If these companies were considered as forming a single broad family business, then it would remain the largest company in South Korea with enormous economic and political power in the country."

The founder was Henry Percival \"Percy\" Bulmer, the twenty-year-old son of the local rector at Credenhill, the Reverend Charles H. Bulmer and his wife Mary. He is said to have taken his mother's advice to make a career in food or drink, \"because neither ever go out of fashion\".The company's two principal brands are its own Bulmers cider, which is sold worldwide, and Strongbow, which is sold across Europe, the US, Australasia and the Far East. The company is owned by Heineken International. Today, HP Bulmer makes 65% of the five hundred million litres of cider sold annually in the United Kingdom and the bulk of the UK's cider exports. The firm's primary competitor is the Irish C&C Group and its Magners brand (which holds the licence to the Bulmers name within the Republic of Ireland only)."

Heathkit manufactured electronic kits from 1947 until 1992. After closing that business, the Heath Company continued with its products for education, and motion-sensor lighting controls. The lighting control business was sold around 2000. The company announced in 2011 that they were reentering the kit business after a 20-year hiatus but then filed for bankruptcy in 2012, and under new ownership began restructuring in 2013. As of 2015 the company has a live website."

The company also operated Gatwick and Stansted airports, and several other UK airports. BAA plc was bought in 2006 by a consortium led by Ferrovial, a Spanish firm specialising in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport, urban and services infrastructure. In March 2009 the company was required to sell Gatwick and Stansted airports, and over the following years sold all its airports other than Heathrow. The company was renamed Heathrow Airport Holdings in 2012 to reflect its main business. The company's head office is located in The Compass Centre on the grounds of London Heathrow Airport in the London Borough of Hillingdon. The company makes money from charging landing fees to airlines and increasingly from ancillary operations within those airports such as retail and property."

  "text" : "HP Autonomy, previously Autonomy Corporation PLC, is a multinational enterprise software company founded in Cambridge, United Kingdom in 1996. Originally, the company specialised in analysis of large scale unstructured \"big data\", becoming the UK's largest and most successful software business by 2010. It used a combination of technologies born out of research at the University of Cambridge and developed a variety of enterprise search and knowledge management applications using adaptive pattern recognition techniques centered on Bayesian inference in conjunction with traditional methods. It maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach, and controls described as a \"rod of iron\", which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest 5% of its sales force each quarter, while cosseting the best sales staff \"like rock stars\". Autonomy was acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in October 2011. The deal valued Autonomy at $11.7 billion (£7.4 billion) with a premium of around 79% over market price that was widely criticized as \"absurdly high\", a \"botched strategy shift\" and a \"chaotic\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings by expanding the high-margin software services sector. Within a year, major culture clashes became apparent and HP had written off $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value. HP claims this resulted from \"accounting improprieties, misrepresentations and disclosure failures\" by the previous management, who in turn accuse HP of a \"textbook example of defensive stalling\"  to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues and that even HP's CFO disagreed with the price paid. External observers generally state that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis-statements, and that HP had overpaid for businesses previously. HP recruited Robert Youngjohns, ex-Microsoft president of North America, to take over HP Autonomy in September 2012, and since that time, has worked towards a turnaround through expanding its information management and analytics software business. Though the company is integrating into HP Software, Autonomy remains a singular operational business. In 2016, HP agreed to sell its Autonomy assets, as part of a wider deal, to the British software company Micro Focus."

The Hooters name is a double entendre referring to both its owl logo, a bird known for its \"hooting\" calls, and an American slang term for human breasts popularized by comedian Steve Martin on the hit comedy series Saturday Night Live. Hooters is a restaurant whose waiting staff are primarily attractive young women, usually referred to simply as \"Hooter Girls\", whose revealing outfits and sex appeal are played up and are a primary component of the company's image. The company employs other men and women as cooks, hosts (at some franchises), busboys, and managers. The menu includes hamburgers and other sandwiches, steaks, seafood entrees, appetizers, and the restaurant's specialty, chicken wings. Almost all Hooters restaurants hold alcoholic beverage licenses to sell beer and wine, and, where local permits allow, a full liquor bar. Hooters T-shirts, sweatshirts, and various souvenirs and curios are also sold. As of 2016 there were more than 430 Hooters locations and franchises around the world and Hooters of America LLC. owns 160 units. There are Hooters locations in 44 U.S. states, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and in 28 other countries.The company's first overseas location was in Singapore, and there are Hooters restaurants in Aruba, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Russia, and one in the United Kingdom, following the closure of the remaining UK franchises. The three largest Hooters restaurants are in Singapore, Tokyo, and São Paulo. In 2015 Hooters announced that it is planning to open more than 30 restaurants in Southeast Asia over the next six years. In January 2011 Chanticleer Holdings LLC of Charlotte, North Carolina and others completed the purchase of Hooters of America Inc. from the Brooks family."

  "text" : "Hollywood Pictures was an American film production label of The Walt Disney Studios, a division of The Walt Disney Company. While then-Disney chief Michael Eisner at first intended Hollywood Pictures to be a full-fledged studio, like Touchstone, in recent years its operations have been scaled back and its management has been merged with the flagship Walt Disney Pictures studio. The division is known for having brought the works of M. Night Shyamalan to the theater; its most profitable film to date is Shyamalan's own breakout hit The Sixth Sense, which grossed over $600 million worldwide upon its 1999 release."

  "text" : "Herbalife International is an American multinational multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$3.825 billion in 2014, a 21% decrease over 2013, and net income of $308.7 million. It incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and its corporate headquarters are there. The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors, some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a multi-level marketing (MLM) compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors. The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a \"sophisticated pyramid scheme\" after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock. The company denies the allegations. However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC."

  "text" : "Hamleys is the oldest and largest toy shop in the world and one of the world's best-known retailers of toys. Founded by William Hamley as \"Noahs Ark\" in High Holborn, London, in 1760, it moved to its current site on Regent Street in 1881. This flagship store is set over seven floors, with more than 50,000 toys on sale. It is considered one of the city's prominent tourist attractions, receiving around five million visitors each year. The chain has ten other outlets in the United Kingdom and also has more than 60 franchises worldwide. Hamleys was bought by the Icelandic investment company Baugur Group in 2003 but was taken over by Baugur's main investor, Landsbanki, when the group defaulted. In 2012, the French toy retailer Groupe Ludendo bought the business for £60 million. In 2015 it was reported that Groupe Ludendo was negotiating the sale of Hamleys, possibly to a Hong Kong company owned by a relative of the owner of department store House of Fraser. Subsequently, it was sold to the Chinese footwear company C.banner for an estimated $154 million."

  "text" : "Human Head Studios is an American computer game development company located in Madison, Wisconsin. It was founded in October 1997 by a group of six developers formerly from Raven Software: Chris Rhinehart, Paul MacArthur, Shane Gurno, Ben Gokey, James Sumwalt, and Ted Halsted—later joined by game producer Tim Gerritsen. Their first game was Rune, a third-person Viking action game. The company's most recent release was the long-anticipated first-person shooter Prey, a game that was executive produced by 3D Realms. In 2002, they established a branch internal to the company dedicated to the development of non-electronic games, including role-playing games, board games and card games. The first release from this branch, The Redhurst Academy of Magic Student Handbook, won an Origins Award in 2003. They released several other board games and card games, but the Adventure Games Division was eventually closed in 2006.

  "text" : "Hearst Television, Inc. (formerly Hearst-Argyle Television) is a broadcasting company in the United States, owned by the New York City-based Hearst Corporation. It holds joint ventures in television production with NBCUniversal Television Distribution (although most of the stations it owns are affiliated with ABC). From 1998 to mid-2009, the company traded its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"HTV.\" Hearst-Argyle was formed in 1997 with the merger of Hearst Corporation's broadcasting division and stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings II, which is partially related to the company of the same name who (in 1994) sold its stations to New World Communications, stations that eventually became Fox-owned stations. Hearst's involvement in broadcasting dates to the 1920s. In terms of audience reach, Hearst is the largest group owner of ABC-affiliated stations, and the second-largest group owner of NBC affiliates. Hearst-owned ABC affiliates in National Football League markets simulcast Monday Night Football games from ESPN that involve these teams - ESPN is 20% owned by Hearst, the rest being owned by ABC's parent, The Walt Disney Company. Other Hearst-owned stations also carry ESPN-aired NFL games, even though they are affiliated with other networks (like WBAL-TV, Baltimore's NBC affiliate). In June 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that it would purchase substantially all of the stock not held by Hearst. Hearst-Argyle Television then dropped \"Argyle\" from its name and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation."

  "text" : "Harpoon Brewery is an American brewery, with plants in Boston, Massachusetts, and Windsor, Vermont. Founded in 1986, the brewery was the first company to obtain a permit to manufacture and sell alcohol in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in more than 25 years. In 2000, it purchased the former Catamount Brewery plant in Windsor. Harpoon has played an important part in the rebirth of the microbrewery system in the United States. As of 2013, it was the twelfth-largest craft brewery and 19th-largest overall brewery in the United States. The brewery is best known for its Harpoon India Pale Ale. It brews multiple other year-round beers including the award-winning Dark, UFO Hefeweizen, UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen, UFO White, Leviathan IPA Rich & Dan's Rye IPA, and Boston Irish Stout, its latest full-time offering. It also brews several house beers at Boston bars, including \"Sevens Ale\" for The Seven's Ale House in Beacon Hill. Harpoon has four seasonal beers, such as an Octoberfest Marzen style Ale  and The Long Thaw White IPA, a style blends the spiciness of a Belgian Wit and the American hop character of an IPA. Another line of beers from Harpoon is its '100 Barrel Series', which consists of a number of one of a kind batches. Locally, Harpoon has become famous for their annual festivals that they hold at the brewery. Their St. Patrick's Day, Harpoonfest and Octoberfest festivals have become a staple in the Boston party scene. These are normally weekend long events filled with music, food and of course tons of beer. Harpoon also organizes an annual 5-mile run  to benefit The Angel Fund and the Harpoon Point to Point to benefit the Vermont Food Bank. Harpoon used to produce several non-alcoholic sodas, including root beer, orange and cream, and cream soda, but ceased production in 2009. However, Harpoon root beer is currently available at both their breweries."

  "text" : "Homestead Records was a Long Island, New York-based sublabel of music distributor Dutch East India Trading. It was founded in 1984 by Sam Berger, who was the American independent buyer for Dutch East India Trading. Berger was finding that many bands who had perhaps released their own first 45 were having difficulty coming up with the finances to press followups. He was able to convince the owner of the company to press and distribute records for bands that already had recorded an album, and have the bands supply the artwork. It is considered instrumental in launching the post-hardcore and noise rock genres. When Berger left to work with Midnight Records, he recommended 18-year-old Gerard Cosloy, whom he knew from Boston and who published a fanzine that Homestead distributed. Cosloy went on to sign many of the notable acts. Cosloy was succeeded by Ken Katkin and later by Steven Joerg. The label's last release was Ivo Perelman's Cama de terra in 1996."

  "text" : "HMV Retail Ltd, formerly HMV Group plc, is a British entertainment retailing company operating in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, and Ireland. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE Fledgling Index. The first HMV-branded store was opened by the Gramophone Company on Oxford Street in 1921, and the HMV name was also used for television and radio sets manufactured from the 1930s onwards. The retail side of the business began to expand in the 1960s, and in 1998 was divested from EMI, the successor to the Gramophone Company, to form what would become HMV Group. HMV stands for His Master's Voice, the title of a painting by Francis Barraud of the dog Nipper listening to a cylinder phonograph, which was bought by the Gramophone Company in 1899. For advertising purposes this was changed to a wind-up gramophone, and eventually used simply as a silhouette. HMV owned the Waterstone's bookshop chain from 1998 until 2011, and has owned the music retailer Fopp since August 2007. It purchased a number of former Zavvi stores in February 2009, and also branched into live music venue management that year by purchasing MAMA Group. It sold the group in December 2012. On 15 January 2013, HMV Group entered administration. Deloitte were appointed to deal with the administration of the company. On 16 January 2013, HMV Ireland declared receivership, and all Irish stores were closed. A week later, on 22 January 2013, it was reported that Hilco UK would buy the debt of HMV, a step towards potentially taking control of the company. The sale of HMV's Hong Kong and Singapore business to private equity firm Aid Partners was completed on 28 February 2013. On 5 April 2013, HMV was bought out of administration by Hilco UK for an estimated £50 million."

  "text" : "HP Foods Limited, formerly based in Birmingham, England, was best known as the producer of HP, Lea & Perrins and Daddies sauce brands. It was also the UK licensee of Chinese food and condiment brand, Amoy Food. Formerly the Midlands Vinegar Company and Smedley HP Foods Limited, it was acquired by Imperial Foods, a division of Imperial Group. HP Foods Ltd was retained by Imperial's parent company Hanson plc even after the demerger of the Imperial Group. It was sold to Groupe Danone SA in 1988 for £199 million. It was sold by Danone to Heinz in June 2005 for £470 million. However, in October of that year the takeover was referred by the UK's Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission. After a review the Competition Commission approved the takeover and Heinz started integrating this new company into the business. In 2007, the iconic Aston, Birmingham factory was demolished, and production of HP and Daddies sauce brands was moved to the Netherlands. Bottling of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce was returned to Worcester, having been moved in 2005 to the Aston factory. During this time, the sauce continued to be manufactured but not bottled at the Midlands Road site."

The company also makes kazoos, recorder flutes, melodicas, banjos, guitars, bass guitars, accordions ,and ukuleles (under the brand name Lanikai), along with its one million harmonicas a year. From the 1940s through 1990s, the company also manufactured various electric/electronic keyboards. Especially in the 1960s and 1990s, they manufactured a range of innovative and popular electromechanical keyboard instruments; the Cembalet, Pianet, Basset, Guitaret, and Clavinet. In the 1980s, several Casio synths were sold under the Hohner brand - for example, the Casio HT-3000/Hohner KS61midi and the VZ-1/HS2). The roots of the Hohner firm are in Trossingen, Baden-Württemberg."

Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the \"Action Office II\") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst. Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design."

  "text" : "HealthSouth Corporation, based in Birmingham, Alabama, is the United States' largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitative hospitals. Operating in 33 states across the country and in Puerto Rico, HealthSouth serves patients through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (120), outpatient rehabilitation satellite clinics (29), and home health and hospice agencies (165). HealthSouth states that its \"hospitals provide a higher level of rehabilitative care to patients who are recovering from conditions such as stroke and other neurological disorders, cardiac and pulmonary conditions, brain and spinal cord injuries, complex orthopedic conditions, and amputations\"; and that subsidiary Encompass \"provides a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home nursing services to adult patients and, in some markets, in-home hospice services and home care services for pediatric patients with severe medical conditions\". HealthSouth was involved in a corporate accounting scandal in which its founder, chairman, and chief executive officer, Richard M. Scrushy, was accused of directing company employees to falsely report grossly exaggerated company earnings in order to meet stockholder expectations. At the company's height in 2003, it recorded nearly $4.5 billion in revenue, dominated the rehabilitation, surgery and diagnostic services market and employed more than 60,000 people at 2,000 facilities in every state of the U.S. along with its facilities in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Puerto Rico and Saudi Arabia. The company was the largest publicly listed healthcare company in the United States based on the number of locations and the third based on revenue. By mid- to late 2006, HealthSouth, which never had to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection,Spartenburg Courts South Carolina completed its recovery and relisted its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HLS. The company currently operates one division: inpatient rehabilitation. The company formerly operated an outpatient rehabilitation, surgery center and diagnostics division. The company also previously owned and operated several acute care hospitals that specialized in orthopedics, but sold all of those hospitals by 2006. The former outpatient division also operated an occupational medicine division until 2001, when it was sold. HealthSouth also sold its Long-term acute care facilities in May 2011. The long-term hospitals contributed around $200 million in revenue."

On May 16, 1974, a compromise settlement with approximately 31,000 class members, establishing a trust fund worth $2,600,381, was approved by the court. The organization was dissolved in 1974, subsequent to the death of Patrick in 1973. The company had been investigated by the Market Court of Sweden, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the State of California. Holiday Magic is cited as an example in graduate level coursework on criminal justice and law journals."

  "text" : "Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama (commonly called HMMA) is an automobile factory in Montgomery, Alabama. It was incorporated as a subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea on April 12, 2002. Construction completed in June 2004, with the official start of production beginning in May 2005. The official grand opening ceremony on May 20, 2005, was attended by former President of the United States, George H. W. Bush and Hyundai Motor Group Chairman, Chung Mong-koo. It employed approximately 3000 workers in 2013. Hyundai announced that the initial investment in the plant as $1.1 billion but the current investment is $1.7 billion. In May 2011, HMMA announced a $173 million investment to increase the capacity of the engine assembly plant. When it was built, the plant was expected to generate an additional 5,500 jobs and $500 million in investments from suppliers. Many of the suppliers were already in the region supplying the Mercedes, Honda and Toyota plants in the state. The success of the HMMA plant and the availability of local suppliers led Hyundai to invest over $1 billion in a new Kia Motors plant in West Point, Georgia. The West Point Kia plant is just over the Alabama state line, less than 85 miles away from the Montgomery plant. The two plants are directly linked by an interstate highway. Through the years some production has been shifted between the two plants. For example, Kia engines are made in the HMMA plant while some SUV production was moved from Hyundai to the West Point Kia plant. As of the end of 2013, the HMMA plant was running in excess of its 300,000 listed capacity, due to high demand for Hyundai automobiles."

  "text" : "Harbinger Corporation was a leader in e-commerce software and network services. Founded in December 1983 by C. Tycho Howle and David Leach as Computer Technologies for the Home in Atlanta, Georgia, it went public in August 1995. It was purchased by Peregrine Systems on 16 June 2000. Originally located at 1800 Century Place, the company relocated to 1055 Lenox Park Blvd. in the early 90's. At its peak, Harbinger had 1,100 employees, 40,000 active customers, and annual revenues exceeding $155 million. After Peregrine went into bankruptcy following 2002 accounting scandals, certain lines of business purchased from Harbinger and Extricity were sold off to Golden Gate Capital and Cerberus Capital Management and ultimately renamed Inovis. For a while, Inovis' European operations used the name Harbinger Commerce. The Harbinger brand became part of Inovis in 2002, which was then acquired by GXS in 2010."

In 2014, Harris was named one of the top hundred federal contractors by Defense News. In January 2015, Wired Magazine ranked Harris Corporation—tied with U.S. Marshals Service—as the number two threat to privacy and communications on the Internet."

  "text" : "Hydro One Limited is an electricity transmission and distribution utility serving the Canadian province of Ontario. Hydro One traces its history to the early 20th century and the establishment of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (renamed \"Ontario Hydro\" in 1974). In October 1998, the provincial government of Premier Mike Harris passed the Energy Competition Act which restructured Ontario Hydro into separate entities responsible for electrical generation, transmission/delivery, and price management with a final goal of total privatization. Hydro One was established at this time as a corporation under the Business Corporations Act with the Government of Ontario as sole shareholder, making it a Crown corporation. Following its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2015, the Government of Ontario began selling shares to the public with a final goal of 60% of the company being held by private investors. A report released on 2 December 2015 by the Auditor General of Ontario raised concern with the sale, indicating that power outages are increasing and that Hydro One's equipment is aging and \"at very high risk of failing\". The estimated cost of necessary repairs was $4.472 billion."

It was originally a brewer of premium beers, including Hahn Premium and Hahn Premium Light. The 1991 recession resulted in reduced demand, and forced a rethink of this policy. A more mainstream beer called Sydney Bitter was produced, with reasonable success. It has launched two new beers since then: Hahn Super Dry in 2006 and Hahn Super Dry 3.5 in 2009. In 1993 the brewery was purchased by conglomerate Lion Chuck was appointed as the Chief Brewer of Lion Co which, at the time, operated eight breweries in Australia and New Zealand and two in China. Production of Hahn beers was moved to the Tooheys brewery in Auburn. The Camperdown brewery itself was renamed to the Malt Shovel Brewery in honour of Australia's first known brewery run and owned by James Squire. It is still operated under the direction of Chuck Hahn."

Harpo Productions's subsidiaries consist solely of Harpo Print, LLC (the company's publishing house). One of its subsidiaries, Harpo Films (the company's film studio), was shut down in early 2013. Another, Harpo Radio (the company's radio broadcasting division), was shut down January 1, 2015 after satellite radio provider SiriusXM decided not to renew the deal with the radio service. The company also counts in its holdings 50% of the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) (the company's joint venture cable network with Discovery Communications). It was based in Chicago, and Harpo Studios (the company's TV production studio and corporate headquarters for Harpo Productions) was located in the Near West Side neighborhood of Chicago until the studios closed in 2015. Harpo Productions and OWN are both currently based in West Hollywood, California. The land where the production studio formerly sat once housed the 2nd Regiment Armory that was used as a makeshift morgue for victims of the capsizing of the steamer SS Eastland. The 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) facility was renovated and opened in the late 1980s for use by The Oprah Winfrey Show. The first \"Oprah\" show taped at Harpo Studios was on January 15, 1990."

  "text" : "Hellenic Shipyards S.A. is a large shipyard in Skaramagas near Athens, Greece. Its origins are connected with the Royal Hellenic Naval Shipyard created in 1937 in order to build warships. Despite heavy investment and an order of 12 destroyers and a number of submarines (of which 2 destroyers were in initial stages of construction), development ceased due to the Second World War while in 1944 the facilities were virtually destroyed by Allied bombing. Operation started in 1957 when Greek business tycoon Stavros Niarchos purchased the ruined shipyard and rebuilt and expanded its facilities; since then the company has built a large number of ships (both civilian and military). Military constructions include Greek-designed Fast Patrol Boats and Gunboats, as well as Frigates, Fast Attack Crafts, Submarines, etc. based on French or German designs. A company division is involved in metal and machinery constructions, including specialized constructions for the Greek Industry, structures and platforms for offshore drilling, cranes, etc. A special branch has also been created since 1986, for the mass production of various types of railcars (diesel and electric) and railroad cars (passenger and freight), mostly on German designs. The company was bought in 2002 by a group of German investors under the industrial leadership of the German shipyard Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW), later a subsidiary of the German ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. However, sector problems have led to a progressive decline of the shipyard. The number of employees was reduced to 1,300 in 2009 (from about 6,200 in 1975) after serious economic problems. On March 1, 2010, an agreement was reached to sell 75.1% of the company to Abu Dhabi Mar."

Founded in 1997, HTC began as an original design manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer, designing and manufacturing devices such as mobile phones and tablets. After initially making smartphones based mostly on Windows Mobile, HTC became a co-founding member of the Open Handset Alliance, a group of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators dedicated to the development of the Android mobile operating system. The HTC Dream, marketed by T-Mobile in many countries as the T-Mobile G1, was the first phone on the market to run Android. HTC later shifted to marketing its own devices, including the HTC One series. In 2011, HTC ranked as the 98th top brand on Interbrand's Best Global Brands report. A September 2013 media report stated that HTC's share of the global smartphone market is less than 3 percent. While rising back to 7.2 percent in April 2015 due to its strong sales of recent devices, its stock price had fallen by 90 percent since 2011, and the company experienced consecutive net losses. In 2016, HTC expanded into virtual reality hardware with the release of HTC Vive."

  "text" : "House of Fraser is a British department store group with over 60 stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was established in Glasgow, Scotland in 1849 as Arthur and Fraser. By 1891, it was known as Fraser & Sons. The company grew steadily during the early 20th century, but after the Second World War, a large number of acquisitions would transform the company into a national chain. Between 1936 and 1985 over seventy companies, not including their subsidiaries, were acquired. In 1948, the company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange, and eventually was included in the FTSE Index before the company was acquired by a consortium of investors including Baugur and Don McCarthy in 2006. On 2 September 2014, Don McCarthy, retiring Executive Chairman of House of Fraser, announced the completion of the sale of 100% of the preferred ordinary shares and B ordinary shares and approximately 89% of the A ordinary shares and preference shares of Highland Group Holdings Ltd, to Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co, a leading chain of Chinese department stores, for an enterprise value of approximately £480 million. The company's acquisitions have included numerous household names, some of which are no longer used as part of the company's long-term strategy of re-branding its stores under the House of Fraser name. Over the years House of Fraser has purchased a number of famous stores, such as the Army & Navy Stores, Barkers of Kensington, Beatties, Dickins & Jones, Jenners, Howells, Kendals, Rackhams, Binns and Harrods of Knightsbridge (which is now owned privately). D H Evans Oxford Street store in London was rebranded as House of Fraser in 2001 and became the chain's flagship store. House of Fraser's largest store is located in Birmingham. The group has been subject to many attempted takeovers by other companies, such as Boots and Lonrho, but it was the acquisition by Baugur Group in 2006 that brought the ownership of House of Fraser to the public's attention, and the resulting changes in its ownership, including shareholding by Lloyds Banking Group."

(浜松ホトニクス株式会社 Hamamatsu Hotonikusu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese manufacturer of optical sensors (including photomultiplier tubes), electric light sources, and other optical devices and their applied instruments for scientific, technical and medical use. The company was founded in 1953 by Heihachiro Horiuchi, a former student of Kenjiro Takayanagi, who is known as \"the father of Japanese television\". Hermann Simon, a leading German business author and thinker, mentioned Hamamatsu in his book titled Hidden Champions of the Twenty-First Century: The Success Strategies of Unknown World Market Leaders as an example of a \"Hidden Champion\". Hamamatsu CCD image sensors are used at the Subaru Telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Hamamatsu Photonics' photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) were designed specifically for the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector facility at the University of Tokyo where 2015 Nobel Prize Laureate Takaaki Kajita conducted his research. In using products contributed by Hamamatsu Photonics, \"Kajita was able to prove that neutrinos do in fact have mass -- a major shift in our fundamental understanding of how the universe works,\" said Tom Baer, chair of the Photonics Industry Neuroscience Group of the National Photonics Initiative. \"This win is a tremendous accomplishment for Kajita and Hamamatsu Photonics.\" The sensors made by the company also helped confirm the existence of the Higgs boson, the so-called God particle, in research that led to the 2013 Nobel Physics prize."

The company was established in 1973 by Michael Pickard as a rival to Little Chef, which was the only national chain of roadside restaurants at the time. The restaurants offered similar fare to Little Chef, such as English breakfasts and fish and chips. The major difference between Happy Eater and Little Chef was that it provided outdoor playground equipment. Outlets were mostly located in South East England, the Midlands and along the A1 corridor. Following Granada's takover of THF in 1995, all Happy Eaters were converted into Little Chefs and the brand was phased out by the end of 1997. The chain received widespread media attention in the early 1990s as a restaurant favoured by the Prime Minister John Major."

It was put into geostationary orbit at 30° west at a height of 36,000 km, which is the location of all their subsequent satellites serving Spain and Europe. The Amazonas satellites (61° west) were inaugurated in 2004 with the launch of Amazonas 1, which serves the American market (mainly Latin America). Amazonas 2 was launched on 1 October 2009 and Amazonas 3 7 February 2013 replacing Amazonas 1, which was moved to a new position at 36° west in September 2013. Amazonas 4A was launched on 22 March 2014. This fleet of satellites will be augmented with Amazonas 4B in 2015.A fifth generation of this satellite series, Amazonas 5, is scheduled for launching in 2017. The development of Amazonas 5 has been awarded to Space Systems/Loral."

  "text" : "Happy Madison Productions is an American film and television production company founded in 1999 by Adam Sandler which is best known for its comedy films. Happy Madison takes its name from the films Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, two box office successes starring Sandler himself, both produced by Robert Simonds. The elderly man depicted in the logo is Sandler's late father, Stanley. In addition to various Sandler-produced films, the company has also released films produced by others, such as Steven Brill (Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds), Dennis Dugan (The Benchwarmers, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Grown Ups, Grown Ups 2), Frank Coraci (Click, Zookeeper, Blended), Fred Wolf (Strange Wilderness, The House Bunny), Tom Brady (The Animal, The Hot Chick, Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star), Peter Segal (Anger Management, 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard), and Nicholaus Goossen (A Day with the Meatball, Grandma's Boy, The Shortcut). The 1998 films The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer helped jump start Sandler's movie career and production company. He produced The Waterboy and co-wrote the script with Tim Herlihy. The film was extremely profitable, earning over $160 million in the United States alone and made Sandler a successful actor with The Waterboy becoming his second $100 million film in a year, along with The Wedding Singer. The company's production office is located in the Judy Garland Building on the Sony Pictures Studios lot in Culver City, California while its corporate and parent company offices (Happy Madison, Inc.) are located in Manchester, New Hampshire run by Adam's brother Scott. The company used to have a subsidiary, Madison 23 Productions, which was aimed towards the drama genre. The only production under Madison 23 was Reign Over Me, starring Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. This studio company on the trailer of Funny People and the poster and trailer for Reign Over Me is also known as \"Mr. Madison Productions\". However, after the financial failure of Reign Over Me, the \"Madison 23\" label was shut down. Happy Madison's most recent releases are The Ridiculous 6 and The Do Over."

It is the world's leading producer of soju, accounting for more than half of that beverage's domestic sales. It also manufactures a variety of other alcoholic beverages including red wine and whiskey. Distilleries are located in Icheon, Cheongwon, and Masan, with the Masan plant geared toward exports. In addition, Jinro produces the Soksu brand of bottled water at a factory in Cheongwon. Jinro has been involved in exporting since 1968, when it began shipping soju to Vietnam in the midst of the Vietnam War. Jinro soju is known by the brand name Chamisul (Hangul: 참이슬). Part of their marketing strategy is to use temperature sensitive paper on their bottle label. A tab in the shape of a frog (the company's mascot) is white when the bottle is warm and becomes blue when the bottle is cold, indicating that the soju is ready to drink. In 2006, the company was acquired by Hite, a popular beverage company whose main product is beer. The target for 2014 sales are 2.2049 trillion won, with an operating profit of 4.876 billion won; as a result, HiteJinro is expected to be the first liquor company in Korea to surpass 2 trillion won in sales. Jinro has been named the top-selling spirit in the world in the Millionaires' Club 2016, after selling 73.8m 9-litre last year."

  "text" : "Hawaiian Falls Waterparks is a chain of faith-based waterparks owned by Harvest Family Entertainment. Hawaiian Falls parks are all built using the public-private partnership model, where cities contribute funds and/or other incentives and the parks are built on public land. Each of the seven parks has a separate lease structure with the cities participation ranging from contributing land and infrastructure costs(Garland and The Colony)to 100% financing . The first two parks were in the City of Garland and the City of the Colony, both in Texas. The third park was located in the South Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. In 2004 Hawaiian Falls experienced financial problems and founder and CEO David Busch sold the company to Herschend Family Entertainment. In 2006 Busch was able to buy the company back from Herschend after purchasing, then reselling The Colony and Garland Parks to CNL Lifestyle Properties. In addition to paying rent to Garland and the Colony, Hawaiian Falls must pay rent to CNL. In 2014 The City of Garland conducted an audit of Hawaiian Falls and was unable to verify Hawaiian Falls gross receipts for the 2011 season. The audit stated that Hawaiian Falls \"could not provide source documentation for group ticket sales,group food and beverage sales,season pass sales and online ticket sales.\" After re-branding the Dallas park Bahama Beach to Hawaiian Falls in 2007, the Company and the City of Dallas agreed to terminate the 11-year management contract because the Company could no longer continue to underwrite the losses at the park. The Dallas park, considered \"the first inner-city waterpark\", was a risky endeavor. David Busch said, \"From a business standpoint, we shouldn't be doing this.\" According to Busch, after Hawaiian Falls and the City ended the management agreement, the park continued to lose money. Busch sees his parks as a \"mission field.\"  The parks are often used for baptisms and other religious activities, and Busch says there were \"more than 2,000 baptisms in our lazy rivers and wavepools\" in 2011 alone. The parks often feature Christian concerts and events, such as \"Modesty Matters\" in 2013. Hawaiian Falls employee program is called \"Connections.\"  According to Rawd B. Jones, whose company Pure Group, administers Connections, the program includes after hours Bible study and church services, as well as training on how to bring the gospel to guests. The seven locations Hawaiian Falls operates are located across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area and Central Texas. In 2014 Hawaiian Falls opened a new waterpark in Pflugerville, Texas, and another in White Settlement, Texas. In addition to the traditional Hawaiian Falls 'micropark,' each of the new parks includes an adventure park (rope course with ziplines), an arcade, and an event center. The adventure parks, arcades, and event centers are open year-round. CEO Busch has said that he sees these year-round parks as a way for Hawaiian Falls to achieve \"endless growth,\" and he is looking to expand outside of Texas. In late July 2014 Busch reported to the Pflugerville Community Development Corporation (PCDC) that because of delays in completing the park due to construction issues, revenues at the Pflugerville park were some 30% less than projected for the park. He implied they would make up this shortfall in the winter, stating, “We will fill that place up all winter long. That’s year-round revenue. And that’s very... What a relief.” In December 2014 Hawaiian Falls closed its 'year-round' adventure parks in Pflugerville and White Settlement. The company claims the parks will re-opening in March \"dependent on the weather\"  Twelve year-round employees were laid-off. Hawaiian Falls Pflugerville was \"expected to employ 100 part-time workers year round\" in addition to its part-time-seasonal and full-time, year-round employees. Numerous public/private projects have been considered by Hawaiian Falls and communities throughout the United States including Henderson, NV; Beaumont, TX; Royse City, TX; Temecula, CA; Grandview, MO; Greenville, Texas,; Rockwall, Texas,; Fontana, California,; Gilbert, Arizona,; Escondido, California,; and Elk Grove Grove, California.; and many others. Hawaiian Falls is awaiting approval on a proposal for a $20 million waterpark in Richland County, South Carolina."

The entire company was eventually purchased by fellow Midwestern drugstore chain Revco.

The Brooks Pharmacy stores were divested by Revco after the purchase; most of them operate as Rite Aid stores."

The federal government through its Department of Transport had owned and operated the airport since its construction in 1960, however by the 1990s it was examining ways to reduce the payroll and scope of Transport Canada's activities. Beginning with changes to the Canada Transportation Act in 1995, Transport Canada began to divest the operation of sea ports and airports to non-profit authorities. On February 1, 2000 HIAA took over management of Halifax Stanfield International Airport from Transport Canada. Transport Canada remains the owner of the airport and charges the HIAA rent, as well as establishing regulations governing airport operations. Since then, HIAA has undertaken an aggressive construction schedule to implement long-neglected improvements to the airport infrastructure. A passenger user fee is charged on all passengers using the airport which helps to fund such improvements to runways and the passenger terminal."

Brothers Anton and Franz Hamm, who were gunsmiths, founded the company in 1878 to build agricultural equipment. The company built their first diesel-powered road roller in 1911, from a design by a second-generation Hamm, Hans Hamm. This was at a time when most rollers where steam powered. In 1928 the company abandoned all other product lines to concentrate on road rollers. Hamm produces the first all-wheel drive-all-wheel steering double-drum, tandem roller and soil compactor with vibration(Unbalance mass principle) in 1932, and retains patent protection rights until 1970. The company introduced an all-wheel steering and all-wheel drive rubber-wheeled roller in 1963, and then rolled out its oscillating vibratory roller in 1989. In 1999 the Wirtgen Group GmbH announced that it would purchase Hamm AG, and the transaction was completed in March 2000."

About half of the former networks of CCF - Union de Banques à Paris, Banque Hervet, Banque de Picardie and Banque de Baecque Beau - now trade as HSBC. This represents a 380 strong network of branches in France with a very strong presence in the Paris region. Other group operations in France include a significant HSBC Private Bank presence, along with a major Corporate Institutional Banking and Markets operation. The Paris trading floor is the Group's second largest trading floor in Europe. Specific areas of particular expertise and responsibility are the trading of government bonds and euro interest rate derivatives, arranging of corporate cash calls, disintermediated and structured finance and project finance. HSBC France had seven regional subsidiaries with 420 branches, but sold them to Banque Populaire in 2008. These regional subsidiaries were Société Marseillaise de Crédit, Banque de Savoie, Banque Chaix, Banque Marze, Banque Dupuy, Banque de Parseval, Banque Pelletier and Crédit Commercial du Sud Ouest."

  "text" : "HSBC Bank plc is one of the largest banking and financial services organisations in the world. HSBC's international network comprises around 7,500 offices in over 80 countries and territories in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa. HSBC Bank plc is one of the four major clearing banks in the United Kingdom and is a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. The business ranges from the traditional High Street roles of personal finance and commercial banking, to private banking, consumer finance as well as corporate and investment banking. Across all brands the bank operates some 1800 sites in the UK. The UK headquarters of HSBC are at HSBC Tower, 8 Canada Square in the Canary Wharf area of east London. This building is also home to HSBC Group's headquarters, and houses some 8,000 staff over 42 floors. HSBC Bank Plc is the only one of Britain's big five banks to hold more deposits than loans (loan:deposit ratio of 90%). This has led to the bank being seen as a less risky proposition than the other banks by investors and customers, as it is able to fully fund its own operations. It has also contributed to the company's share price maintaining value throughout the credit crunch, unlike other banks in the market."

  "text" : "Harris Scarfe is a department store established in Adelaide, South Australia in 1849. It is owned by South African retail group Pepkor. As of September 2015 there were 54 Harris Scarfe stores in two formats: \"Harris Scarfe\" department stores and \"HS Home\" homewares stores. The store has a positioning of brand led value, with hi-lo pricing. Key categories are kitchenware, manchester, electrical goods, and apparel. Harris Scarfe has expanded through organic growth, new store openings, mergers, and acquisitions. The current store network reflects this mix, in particular the purchase or merging of regional or state based retail groups including Allens in New South Wales and FitzGerald's in Tasmania. The group is now owned by Pepkor, but has at times been subject to different ownership structures and a period of being in receivership. The Rundle Place store on Rundle Mall, Adelaide has remained the business' main store and showcases a contemporary \"look and feel\" across several floors. Regional and suburban store layout varies significantly."

  "text" : "Hommell is a French Automobile manufacturer, started in 1990 by Michel Hommell, a former racing driver and the owner of Échappement, a French car magazine. The company is based in Lohéac, near Rennes, Brittany. A prototype of the kind of sports car he would like to be produced was shown at the 1990 Paris Salon, where it was well received, encouraging him to go ahead with a production version. This was shown at the 1994 Geneva Motor Show. The 2 seat sports coupe is powered by a mid-mounted 2.0lt Peugeot engine and 6 speed gearbox in a tubular steel chassis with all-round independent suspension. In 1998, the Barquette, an open-top version was announced, and at the same time the Berlinette RS, as the original model was now called, had a more powerful Citroën engine fitted. The brand has produced three models under the direction of Gilles Dupré: \n*  In 1994 \n*  Berlinette Échappement \n* Engine: 1998 cc in-line 4-cylinder DOHC 16-valve  \n* Power: 155 bhp (116 kW; 157 PS) @ 6500 rpm \n* Torque: 137 lb·ft (186 N·m) @ 3500 rpm \n* Weight: 980 kg (2,161 lb) \n* Top Speed: 138 mph (222 km/h) \n* Barquette \n* Engine: 1998 cc in-line 4-cylinder DOHC 16-valve  \n* Power: 155 bhp (116 kW; 157 PS) @ 6500 rpm \n* Torque: 145 lb·ft (197 N·m) @ 5500 rpm \n* Weight: 940 kg (2,072 lb) \n* Top Speed: 130 mph (210 km/h) \n* In 1999 \n* Berlinette RS coupé \n* Engine: 1998 cc in-line 4-cylinder DOHC 16-valve  \n* Power: 167 bhp (125 kW; 169 PS) @ 6500 rpm \n* Torque: 147 lb·ft (199 N·m) @ 5500 rpm \n* Weight: 950 kg (2,094 lb) \n* Top Speed: 143 mph (230 km/h) \n* In 2001 \n* Berlinette RS2 \n* Engine: 1998 cc in-line 4-cylinder DOHC 16-valve  \n* Power: 195 bhp (145 kW; 198 PS) @ 6750 rpm \n* Torque: 159 lb·ft (216 N·m) @ 5500 rpm \n* Weight: 950 kg (2,094 lb) \n* Top Speed: 143 mph (230 km/h) In December 2003, the production was stopped for financial reasons.

  "text" : "Hyperlite is a wakeboarding company that has been around since the sport was first invented. Hyperlite sponsors many professional wakeboarders and wakeskaters, such as Shaun Murray, Rusty Malinoski, Denise de Haan, Heather Johnson, Jd Webb, Jimmy Lariche, Jacob Valdez, Nick Davies, Jenacee Jackson, Maeghan Mckenzie, Mike Schwene, Brian Grubb, Brandon Thomas, and Chris Kallas. Hyperlite wakeboards were not only amongst the first wakeboards on the scene but founder Herb O'Brien was one of the founding members of this now nationally known X-Game. Herb - who owned the water ski company, H.O. Sports hooked up with some of the best surfboard shapers in Hawaii to design and build the first compression-molded neutral-buoyancy wakeboard, the Hyperlite. This innovation sparked the massive growth of what today is known as wakeboarding. Some of the first names of this new sport were skiboarding, and even skurfing, but those only lasted for a few years; Ultimately wakeboarding became the official name of this sport. The Hyperlite's new features such as: neutral buoyancy and better bindings gave riding behind a boat a new feel that was comfortable and accessible. Herb O'Brien continued to refine the wakeboard. The board had a thin profile, sharp edges and would carve like a slalom ski. It also had phasers (large dimples on the bottom), which broke up water adhesion and gave the board a quicker \"loose\" feel and softer landings from wake jumps. The thin shape, neutral buoyancy and phasers were features made possible by the compression-molding process. Following the lead of the H.O. Sports, other board companies such as Neptune and Connelly started manufacturing their own compression molded wakeboards and the sport really began to catch fire. Hyperlite wakeboards have come a long way in the past several years. Now featuring top of the line technology that professionals and novices alike can appreciate and enjoy. This famous sport now has dozens of wakeboard manufacturers and Hyperlite has branched out specializing in only top of the line wakeboard gear, from ropes and specialized handles to boots and apparel. Hyperlite has even started to manufacture the Wakeskate which is exactly what it sounds like, a wakeboard that utilizes just the technology of the board, your feet and your body's ability to harness the laws of physics. Hyperlite Wakeboards is a company that continues to create technology that pushes the limits and allows its riders to perform to the best of their ability, while not neglecting the lifestyle of the rider. To facilitate different riders of different shapes, sizes and styles Hyperlite boast three different core types, as well as six hydrodynamic shell and dozens of designs that give Hyperlite not only its name but its reputation as well. Hyperlite combines the technology that the rider needs with the design that the rider loves. In 2006 Hyperlite founder Herb O'Brien left H.O. and Hyperlite to form a new watersports company named Square One with a new wakeboarding brand, Ronix, that would compete with Hyperlite. Hyperlite launched the Byerly brand of wakeboard and wakeskate products for the 2007 season, promoting Scott Byerly as his own distinct brand for the first time."

  "text" : "Hamer Guitars was an American manufacturer of electric guitars founded in 1973, in Wilmette, Illinois, by vintage guitar shop owners Paul Hamer, Jol Dantzig James Walker and John Montgomery. The company's early instruments featured guitar designs based on the Gibson Explorer (The Standard) and Gibson Flying V (Vector), before adding more traditional Gibson-inspired designs such as the Sunburst. Hamer Guitars is generally considered the first \"boutique\" electric guitar brand that specifically catered to professional musicians, and was one of the first guitar manufacturers to produce a 12 string bass guitar. The company was incorporated in Illinois in 1976 by Montgomery, Dantzig, James Walker and Hamer. It was acquired by Kaman Music Corporation in 1988, which was purchased in turn by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in 2008. Hamer offered a wide array of electric guitars and electric basses, and, since its foundation placed an emphasis on producing high-quality instruments with vintage aesthetics as well as creative innovations. Kaman marketed a lower-priced line of Asian-built instruments called the Hamer XT Series and Slammer by Hamer,, which was discontinued in 2009. In February 2013 Fender announced that the Hamer brand was being discontinued after 40 years of production."

  "text" : "Hancom, Inc. (called Haansoft Corporation in English until early 2010; Hangul: 한글과컴퓨터; RR: Hangeulgwa Keompyuteo; MR: Hangŭl-gwa K'ŏmp'yut'ŏ; literal translation: Hangul and Computer) Hancom (KOSDAQ: HAANSOFT) is an office suite software developer in Korea. Established in 1990, the company created Hangul, a native word processing program for the Korean language. The story of Hancom mirrors the fortunes of Korea’s reborn software industry through support from the government. In 1998, the company nearly went bust, although it had been considered a national treasure: bad management, the Asian financial crisis, and software piracy had brought the company to its knees. Microsoft, which had about 15% market penetration in office apps at the time in Korea, offered US$20 million to Hancom to stop producing Hangul and instead resell Microsoft's localized Word program. For a small investment, Microsoft would have wiped out Hangul's main competitor completely in Korea, one of the few countries in the world that had still resisted wide adoption of Microsoft's office suite. When the news of the deal broke, Koreans united in a national fervor and raised over US$10 million through a national campaign to save the company. In addition, Hancom’s near-bankruptcy brought the issue of software piracy under the national spotlight. As a result, Koreans began to pay for their software. As of March 2015, Hancom employs 368 people. The company has been profitable for nine consecutive years, with estimated sales of KRW 54.5 billion (US$48.6 million) for last year."

  "text" : "H. Samuel is a mass-market jewellery chain, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is the number one middle mass-market jewellery store in the United Kingdom. There are 303 stores as of 16 February 2015. An increasing number of the chain's stores trade in a new format known internally as 'Millennium format' stores. These are typified by removing the arcade-style window displays and having low-level display cases up to the lease line in mall stores and having large ceiling to floor windows in High Street stores. This means the customer can not window shop and must enter the store to see what is on sale. The chain is part of the Signet Group who also own the Ernest Jones and Leslie Davis high-street jewellery stores in the UK. Signet Group, listed on the London and New York stock exchanges also owns Sterling, the largest speciality jewellery retailer in the United States of America, which operates the number one Kay brand, Jared the Galleria Of Jewelry and a further ten regional brands. In 2005 the chain launched its first e-commerce site. Some H. Samuel stores were formerly branches of Ratner's Jewellers, which were re-branded following that brand's spectacular fall from grace in 1992."

It is resistant to bleeding and feathering of inks and paints, especially fountain pen inks and watercolors, though alcohol-based pens will bleed through. The book is structured with a yearly overview section, monthly pages, various informational pages in the back, and most importantly, one full page dedicated to each day. Daily pages display the current moon phase, the day/week of the year, and short quotations from a variety of sources. The planner may be used in an optional cover with several useful features like card pockets, bookmarks, and a pen holder which doubles as a clasp. Covers are offered in a variety of materials and are sold in a different set of designs every year. The planner and covers are available in two sizes, the A6 'Original', and the larger A5 'Cousin'. In 2012, Hobonichi collaborated with designer brand ARTS&SCIENCE to release an English-language version of the planner for the first time. The English planner is available only in A6 size, differentiated by a black cover with gold stamped Japanese characters for planner, \"手帳\" (Techō), and the ARTS&SCIENCE logo, as opposed to the cream cover of the Japanese version."

  "text" : "Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft is a German construction company based in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Hochtief is Germany's largest construction company and operates globally, ranking as one of the largest general construction companies in the United States through its Turner subsidiary, and in Australia through a 53.43% shareholding in CIMIC Group. In 2010 it employed more than 70,000 employees across five corporate divisions. One of these, Hochtief Concessions, is a major airport operator. The others are involved with construction project planning, finance, construction and operation. Work done in 2010 was €23.23 billion, with more than 80% coming from operations outside Germany. The company's history dates back to 1874 and includes engineering feats such as the transplantation of the Abu Simbel rock temples in Egypt (saving them from the rise of the River Nile caused by the Aswan High Dam), and infrastructure projects like the new Athens International Airport and Germany's first nuclear power plant. It is also noted for its involvement with the Bauhaus movement, particularly for its work at Zollverein colliery and the reconstruction of the Kandinsky-Klee house in Dessau; both World Heritage Sites. During World War II it deployed forced labor on construction projects. It built the Führerbunker in Berlin, the scene of Adolf Hitler's suicide, as well as Hitler's home in Berghof and the Wolfsschanze headquarters. More recent constructions have included Bosphorus Bridge (Turkey), King Abdulaziz International Airport (Saudi Arabia), and the Messeturm and Commerzbank Tower in Frankfurt. In late 2010, Spanish construction company Grupo ACS, which already owned a 30 percent stake of Hochtief, launched a bid that would allow ACS to acquire an additional 20 percent stake of Hochtief. The bid was approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) on 29 November 2010. ACS increased its stake in Hochtief to 50.16 percent in June 2011, effectively taking over control of Hochtief."

It has been ranked the World’s Best Performing Emerging Markets Fund over the 1996-2001 five-year period by Nelsons. Hermitage is an activist fund. One of its main tactics is to expose corporate corruption in the companies it is holding, in the hope of improving managerial behaviour and lessen the significant discount that corruption has on share prices. Most famously, Hermitage has helped to expose several high-profile cases of corruption in Russia's largest company Gazprom between 1998 and 2000. In October 2000, Hermitage reported that \"investors are valuing this company as if 99 percent of its assets have been stolen.

The Commission is responsible for constructing, operating, maintaining two suspension bridges that cross Halifax Harbour between the communities of Halifax and Dartmouth. The Commission also maintains authority over any other bridge or tunnel structures crossing the harbour limits, including across the Northwest Arm, although no such bridge or tunnel currently exists. In March 2009 the Commission launched its current operating name, Halifax Harbour Bridges, as well as an updated logo. The Commission reports to the Minister of Finance and the Nova Scotia Cabinet approves the Commission's financing. The Commission has nine board members, five of whom are appointed by the Province, including the Chair and Vice-Chair; the Halifax Regional Municipality appoints four Councillors for the remaining seats on the board. The Commission's toll rates are approved by the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board."

Originally a 50/50 joint venture founded in January, 2005 between South Korean wireless operator SK Telecom and American Internet services provider EarthLink, early losses caused EarthLink to stop providing additional funding in fall of 2007. SK Telecom provided the required additional funding to sustain Helio, which was re-organized as Helio LLC, and by January 2008, SK Telecom had assumed an increased ownership stake and with it, operational control of the joint venture. Although SK Telecom publicly pledged to support Helio, SK Telecom entered into talks to sell the company to rival MVNO Virgin Mobile USA. Virgin Mobile USA closed the acquisition of Helio and its 170,000 subscribers on August 22, 2008. Virgin Mobile USA exited the postpaid wireless business and retired the Helio brand on May 25, 2010. The Helio brand was resurrected by Ubi Telecom in July 2015. Helio's new $29 per month rate plan offers unlimited talk, text and data but at capped data speeds of 128kbit/s."

  "text" : "S.H. Heironimus Co. (also known as Heironimus) was an American department store chain based in Roanoke, Virginia. S.H. Heironimus opened his first store in downtown Roanoke in 1890. At its peak, Heironimus had several locations around Roanoke and Lynchburg. In 1993, Heironimus was acquired by the Texas-based retailer Dunlaps which initially invested in improving the stores' inventory and appearance. In January 1996, the chain's flagship store in Downtown Roanoke was closed but locations in area malls remained open. However, the chain occupied the increasingly untenable niche between discount stores like Wal-Mart and the variety and more upscale merchandise available at regional malls. In 2004, Dunlaps announced that the remaining Heironimus stores would close as their inventory was liquidated. The Spartan Square location in Salem was the last to remain open before closing in January 2005. The S.H. Heironimus Warehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006."

  "text" : "Harrisongs Ltd is a music publishing company, founded in 1964 by English musician and songwriter George Harrison, then a member of the Beatles. On 11 September 1964, Harrison created Mornyork Ltd, which, by 7 December that year, had changed its name to Harrisongs Ltd. The company is headquartered at 27 Ovington Square in London's Knightsbridge district, in the same building that houses the Beatles' Apple Corps. Harrison's earliest Beatles compositions were published by Northern Songs, the company set up in 1963 by Dick James and Brian Epstein on behalf of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were the main songwriting Beatles. Harrison and Ringo Starr had both signed contracts with Northern Songs, but neither was satisfied with their subsequent writer's royalties and the lowly status implicit in this business arrangement. In 1967, Harrison wrote \"Only a Northern Song\" about his dissatisfaction with the company. He duly let his Northern Songs contract expire in March 1968 and adopted Harrisongs for his music publishing, while Starr founded Startling Music. Harrison's 1968 solo album Wonderwall Music was the last release on which his new compositions were published by Northern Songs and its US counterpart, Maclen Music. That year, Harrisongs published \"Sour Milk Sea\", together with his four contributions to the Beatles' eponymous double album, including \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". Harrison's two songs on the band's 1969 album Abbey Road, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", became the most widely syndicated compositions from that album, due in part to the number of cover versions they attracted. With over 150 cover recordings and the enduring popularity of the Beatles' version, \"Something\" provided Harrisongs with what author Mark Lewisohn terms \"a rich flow of royalties down the years\". Lewisohn also comments that, with Harrison's ownership of the company increasing from 80 per cent to 100 per cent in 1970, the move from Northern Songs proved especially beneficial, as disagreements between Lennon and McCartney had resulted in them losing control and much of the revenue generated from their songs. Harrison's company also published his early post-Beatles solo work, including the songs from All Things Must Pass. In 1973, Harrison assigned the publishing rights for his new album, Living in the Material World, to the Material World Charitable Foundation, a Harrisongs-administered charitable organisation he set up to aid starving countries. His songs from 1974's Dark Horse onwards were originally published by Ganga Publishing, B.V. in the United States and Oops Publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They are now published by Umlaut Corporation, which is controlled by the composer's widow, Olivia Harrison. Harrisongs is now the publishing company for Harrison's son Dhani's indie rock band, thenewno2."

Founders Andy Cruz and Rich Roat met at Miller Mauro Group, Inc., a Wilmington, Del. marketing communications agency. They briefly worked for Swfte International, a Miller Mauro Group client, before leaving to form Brand Design Co., Inc in 1993. Cruz and Roat formed House Industries in late 1993. The company goes to elaborate lengths to promote its typefaces including creating chairs, pillows and various other items inspired by the typefaces they sell. In one promotion they created the fictional character René Albert Chalet and promoted him as the creator of a new typeface Chalet. In February 2010 LAS Magazine wrote about the company's Eames Century Modern Collection, a project done in collaboration with the estate of architects Charles and Ray Eames. Its first ever West Coast exhibition showcasing its history is running at Chapman University's Guggenheim Gallery from February 6 to March 9, 2012."

  "text" : "Herley Industries, based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is an American company that specializes in supplying microwave and millimeter wave products to defense and aerospace industries. They provide solutions for radars, flight instrumentation, weapon sensors, electronic warfare systems and guidance systems for contractors, the U.S. government, as well as governments and militaries worldwide. Herley was founded in 1965, and has acquired several companies such as Vega Precision, Metraplex Corporation, General Microwave and Innovative Concepts throughout its history. In June 2006, the company and its former chairman, Lee N. Blatt were indicted on multiple charges in connection with purported activities resulting in alleged excessive profits by the Company on three contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense. Three of the company’s nine manufacturing plants were placed under suspension, meaning they could not initiate any new federal contracts. The plants affected were in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Woburn, Massachusetts and Farmingdale, New York. In addition, a Chicago marketing office was also suspended. At approximately the same time, Herley stock lost approximately 34% of its value, decreasing to $10.06 a share, the lowest since November 1998. In July 2010 the company settled for $10 million USD without admitting any wrongdoing. Lee N. Blatt retired at the time, and Myron Levy was chosen as his successor. On October 13, 2006, the company announced that it had reached an administrative agreement with the OGC Acquisition Integrity Office, Department of Navy. With this agreement, the suspension preventing new contract awards was lifted, and Herley was able to resume its normal business dealings with both its DOD and prime contractor customers. On July 22, 2009, Herley replaced Myron Levy as chief executive and chairman. The company stated that Levy's efforts had positioned it for future growth, but that it was “time for a completely new management team drawn from key personnel throughout the company with proven records of success, to move the company forward.\" David Lieberman, a previous member of the board and a partner with the New York firm of Beckman, Lieberman & Barandes LLP, was named chairman. Richard Poirier, who's been with Herley since 1992, was named the new CEO and president. As of 2015 Herley was acquired by Ultra Electronics and is now under the name Ultra - Herley."

  "text" : "Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd. is a supplier of machinery for injection molding of plastics. The company was founded in 1953 by Robert Schad, a German immigrant to Canada. Husky was initially a small machine shop with no ties to the plastics industry. Husky now manufactures a wide range of injection molding machines, injection molds, hot runners, robots, and auxiliary systems used in plastics manufacturing. Husky's head office and primary manufacturing site is located in Bolton, Ontario, Canada. Husky also has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Austria, Luxembourg, Brazil, and China. Sales, parts, and technical support centers are located across the globe. Husky currently employs more than 4,000 people worldwide. Husky is specializing in PET for beverage packaging products. Husky controls more than 50% of the global market for PET processing systems. Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd. was a publicly traded company from 1998 to 2007. Owning 44% of the company's stock, Robert Schad was the controlling shareholder. The company's common shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On December 13, 2007, the Canadian private equity investment firm Onex Corporation completed a friendly buy-out of Husky. The deal was worth C$960 million. Onex announced on November 17, 2009, that it planned to sell its stake in Husky in a new initial public offering though it did not sell during that time. On December 17, 2010, it was reported that Onex had started talks to sell Husky to rival buyout firms intending to fetch C$2 Billion. Berkshire Partners LLC, the Boston-based private equity firm, and OMERS Private Equity Inc., the private equity arm of the OMERS Worldwide group of companies, announced on June 30, 2011 the successful closing of their previously announced acquisition of Husky International Ltd."

Due to the film's poor reception, the majority of their productions such as Crawl and a CGI remake of The Brave Little Toaster have long since been in Development Hell. A subsidiary of the company is Jambalaya Studios which has produced animated television series and feature films such as The Proud Family, Da Boom Crew, Bebe's Kids and The Proud Family Movie.

The name of the group is derived from the location of its major members' headquarters in the Hitotsubashi area of Tokyo. The group companies are mostly run by the Ōga family, whose influence in the companies is still strong today. It was started when Shogakukan, which was focused mainly on educational magazines and other related publishing at the time, decided to spin off a company (Shueisha) to produce entertainment magazines. Eventually, Shogakukan moved into the entertainment business as well, and became a rival of Shueisha, and the group was formed to help each one grow. The headquarters buildings for Shogakukan and Shueisha are right next to each other."

  "text" : "For the song, see Blind Melon Holyman was an Australian company that operated cargo ships and ferries in Australia and other countries worldwide. The company had three divisions; Domestic shipping and transport services, Ferries and Bulk commodity handling. The company was born of the Shipping and Development Division of global transport group, TNT, and was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange as an independent entity in 1994. Assets in the original float included a gas pipeline, a coal loading terminal, bulk ore carriers, bulk sugar carriers, a 50% interest in Condor Ferries (Guernsey), and premium commuter ferry service, Express Navigation (New York). Not long after the float, the company expanded its presence in the fast ferry industry by taking a majority stake in a start-up ferry operation, Catlink, in Denmark. The fast car ferry revolutionised transport in Denmark, and the start-up took at 25% market share during its first summer season. In the same year, it redeployed one of its fast ferries to New Zealand during the Northern Winter / Southern Summer, operating from Wellington to Picton. The company also expanded its US holdings by acquiring a stake in Catalina Cruises, which operated ferries between Long Beach and Avalon (Catalina Island) in California. To take that holding, Holyman devised an innovative ownership approach, delivering effective financial and management control, while still remaining within the highly restrictive Jones and Passenger Services Acts, laws that prevent foreign ownership of US Domestic shipping interests. The intention was to replicate that structure in investment in other lucrative US domestic ferry opportunities. In 1997, Holyman over-reached, acquiring a majority interest in Sally Line, which operated a ferry between Ramsgate (UK) and Oostende (Belgium). It replaced the conventional vehicular ferry with a fast Incat built ferry. For a brief time, at its apogee, Holyman was the world's leading fast vehicle ferry operator. Unfortunately, the Holyman Sally route was unable to attract sufficient revenue to make the service profitable. Weather conditions and technical issues with the Incat vessel also hampered operations, and ten months after Holyman Sally commenced, the company was in trouble. The poor financial performance of Holyman Sally was almost identical to financial projections prepared during the early analysis of the route's viability by Holyman's development team but these early analyses were dismissed as being too conservative, and the Managing Director pressed on with the project. At the same time, marketing inertia from local management, coupled with technical and environmental issues, meant Catlink also began to lose money. The company's losses were fatal, and by mid-1998, the Board of the company began disposing of assets to stave off bankruptcy. By late 1999, Holyman was a shell, with most of its assets sold, and in 2000 what was left of Holyman Ltd was acquired by Lang Corporation."

Some of its most famous products include Sharbat Rooh Afza, Safi, Roghan Badam Shirin, Sualin, Joshina and Cinkara. It is associated with Hamdard Foundation, a charitable educational trust. Hamdard Laboratories was founded in 1906 in Delhi by Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed and Ansarullah Tabani, a Unani practitioner. The name Hamdard means \"companion in suffering\" in Urdu language. After Abdul Majeed's death, his son Hakeem Abdul Hameed took over the administration of Hamdard Laboratories at the age of fourteen. Abdul Hameed became known as \"Hakeem Sahab\".Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed was born in Pelivet, India in 1883 to Sheikh Rahim Bakhsh. He is said to have learnt the complete Holy Quran Sharif by heart. He also studied the origin of Urdu and Persian languages. Subsequently he acquired the highest degree in the unani system of medicine. Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed got in touch with Hakim Zamal Khan, who had a keen interest in herbs and was famous for identifying medicinal plants. Having consulted with his wife, Abdul Majeed set up a herbal shop at House Qazi in Delhi in 1906 and started to produce herbal medicine there. In 1920 the small herbal shop turned into a full-fledged production house. Hamdard Foundation was created in 1964 to disburse the profits of the company to promote the interests of the society. All the profits of the company go to the foundation. Hamdard Laboratories has a twin manufacturing plant in Ghaziabad and one plant in Manesar Haryana. One of its products, Safi, was previously found to contain harmful levels of heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic."

  "text" : "Harken, Inc. is an international manufacturer specializing in performance sailing hardware and industrial solutions, headquartered in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The company was founded in a 60-foot trailer in 1967 by brothers Peter Harken and Olaf Harken. Originally, the brothers manufactured sailboats under the name Vanguard and kept the hardware business separate so they could sell to competing boatbuilders. Gary Comer, founder of Lands' End clothing company, advised and helped them distribute their first blocks by placing them in the Lands' End catalogue. In 1986, Vanguard Sailboats was spun off to Stephen Clark in Rhode Island so that the brothers could focus on hardware. Harken hardware has been a dominant force in the racing segment for many years, making its Olympic and America's Cup debuts in 1976 and 1977, respectively. Harken's primary manufacturing plants are the Pewaukee headquarters and the Italian office in Limido Comasco, Como. Harken has sales and service offices in USA (Rhode Island, California, Florida), France, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Today Harken racing equipment is known as a high-quality brand among sailors worldwide. Harken equipment may be found on racing boats as small as the 7-foot Optimist (dinghy) to mega yachts and ocean racers."

  "text" : "Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc. (阪急阪神ホールディングス株式会社 Hankyū Hanshin Hōrudingusu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a stockholding company which owns Hankyu Corporation, Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd. and affiliate companies. On October 1, 2006, Hankyu Holdings changed its name to the present corporate name following the merger with Hanshin Electric Railway. On the same day Hankyu Corporation Group was renamed Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Group, and the Hankyu Toho Group renamed Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group. The operations of the company are centered on transportation, retailing, real estate, entertainment and media. The transportation segment is the company's main cashflow generating business and comprises the railway companies Hanshin Electric Railway (acquired in 2006) and Hankyu Railway. It also includes the smaller railway lines of Hokushin Kyūkō Electric Railway and Nose Electric Railway, as well as equity stakes in Kita-Osaka Kyūkō Railway, Sanyo Electric Railway, Osaka Monorail and Kobe Electric Railway. The company also owns various taxi and bus franchises. Hankyu and Hanshin also both had air cargo and express freight subsidiaries, which were combined in the Hankyu Hanshin Express Holdings company. The retailing business is mainly concentrated in the company's large shareholding of H2O Retailing, the company formed via the merger of the Hankyu and Hanshin Department Store companies. The company owns and operates many hotels, and is developing real estate projects mainly on land along its railway lines through its subsidiary Hankyu Realty, which was previously separately listed, but fully acquired through a stock swap in 2002. It has spun off some of its vast real estate holdings (such as the HEP Five building) into a REIT company, the Hankyu REIT. The group has a controlling stake in Toho, which next to its many media interests (movie development and distribution, as well as a large stake in Fuji Media Holdings) has also large real estate interests. Other companies in the entertainment area include the Hanshin Tigers and the Takarazuka Revue, and stakes in Kansai TV and FM Osaka, as well as tourism operations (e.g. Hankyu Travel)."

When the Foundation was founded, public understanding towards AIDS was limited and misconceptions about AIDS (e.g., that AIDS is a contagious disease) were common, leading to widespread discrimination against patients infected with AIDS. Recently, the Foundation has a full-time staff of 13 but relies heavily on over 300 volunteers to maintain services such as telephone hotlines, blood testing and counselling, and support programmes for people living with AIDS."

  "text" : "Hard Candy is an American cosmetics company, founded in 1995 by Iranian American sisters and Benjamin A. Einstein. Dineh Mohajer and ex-boyfriend Ben Einstein (who now owns Einstein Cosmetics) and several successful sport media companies, Pooneh Mohajer (who now owns tokidoki). The company's first product was nail polish that Dineh mixed herself - a shade of baby blue named \"Sky\" to match her Charles David sandals. After receiving scores of compliments on the unique shade, Dineh began selling it at Fred Segal in Santa Monica, and Ben began selling to many other top retailers including Nordstroms. In that same year, actress Alicia Silverstone appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and, when asked about her pastel blue fingernails, replied, \"It's 'Sky' by Hard Candy,\" causing an overnight explosion of the brand. Ben and Dineh appeared on segments of MTV House of Style program several times. A mere 18 months later, the brand was quoted as generating $10 million a year in a Forbes advertisement featuring Dineh. Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), who owns Donna Karan, Givenchy, Sephora, TAG Heuer, and Veuve Clicquot, acquired Hard Candy in 1999 for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition afforded Hard Candy greater distribution and a larger brand to attach itself to. It was later sold to Falic Fashion Group, a Hollywood, Florida-based corporation operating on the duty-free market, and a subsidiary of Duty Free America. In 2009, Hard Candy announced a partnership with Wal-Mart to take the brand to mass. NuWorld Beauty and Wal-Mart have worked together for over a year on the marketing concept, product creation, and package development of Hard Candy. “We at NuWorld beauty were very excited developing this brand. It was a tremendous amount of fun. The sole direction we provided to the product development and marketing team was to create the line as if we were creating a prestige brand for the specialty market. The team exceeded my expectations.” says Stu Dolleck, President of NuWorld Beauty. Hard Candy's new line, which premiered in the fall of 2009, consists of 261 products. The company kept some of the original Hard Candy products, among them their iconic nail polish, and introduced new products, such as Kaleyedescope Baked Eyeshadow, Eye Tattoo, Press-On Eyeshadow, and Take Me Out Eyeliner, which doubles as a hair stick."

  "text" : "The Helms Bakery in Culver City, California was a notable industrial bakery of Southern California that operated from 1931 to 1969. In 1926, Paul Helms of New York took an early retirement for health reasons and moved his family to Southern California and its mild climate. Helms started construction on a building between Washington and Venice Boulevards in 1930 and, on March 2, 1931, the Helms Bakery opened with 32 employees and 11 delivery coaches (trucks). By the next year, the Helms Bakery had become the \"official baker\" of the 1932 Summer Olympics when Paul Helms won a contract to supply bread for the 1932 games in Los Angeles. His slogan was \"Olympic Games Bakers - Choice of Olympic Champions.\" Four years later in time for the 1936 Summer Olympics Germany asked Helms for his bread recipes to feed to the German Olympic team. His relationship with Olympians continued in later years, the U.S. teams at London and Helsinki requested his bread be served. Early Helms vehicles sported the Olympic symbol, and it also appeared on, and was mentioned in, the Helms logo on the bread wrappers, the company logo and sign. Despite never being sold in stores, Helms baked products soon became known to millions of consumers. The Helms motto was \"Daily at Your Door\" and every weekday morning, from both the Culver City facility and a second Helms Bakery site in Montebello, dozens of Helms coaches, painted in a unique two-tone scheme, would leave the bakery for various parts of the Los Angeles Basin, some going as far as the eastern San Gabriel Valley. This is remarkable because the network of freeways had not yet been built, so the trip might take an hour or more. One of these coaches is on display at the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, and the Lyon Air Museum, in Santa Ana. Each coach would travel through its assigned neighborhoods, with the driver periodically pulling (twice) on a large handle which sounded a distinctive whistle or stop at a house where a Helms sign, a blue placard with an \"H\" on it, was displayed in their windows. Customers would come out and wave the coach down, or sometimes chase the coaches to adjacent streets. Wooden drawers in the back of the coach were stocked with fresh donuts, cookies, pastries and candies, while the center section carried dozens of loaves of freshly baked bread. Products often reached the buyers still warm from the oven. Helms Bakery coaches were manufactured by Divco, an example of which may be found at the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. Helms' Divco coaches were powered by various engines, including motors purchased from Nash and Studebaker. Paul Helms died on January 5, 1957 at age 67, but the business continued to operate, run by family members. Its delivery network gradually grew to include Fresno to the north; San Bernardino to the east, and south to Orange County and San Diego. In the company's final year of operation, a clever marketing campaign netted Helms a contract to furnish \"the first bread on the moon,\" via the Apollo 11 space mission. The San Bernardino facility was located on the northeast corner of Mt Vernon Avenue and Birch Street. After Helm Bakeries closed that location, it was taken over as a small warehouse by FEDCO Corporation, which has since gone out of business as well. The building in San Bernardino is still there, housing a mattress and home furnishings business. Although popular, the Helms method of neighborhood delivery was doomed both by the expense of sending their coaches hundreds of miles each week and by the advent of the supermarket, which stocked products from other (less expensive) bakeries, which delivered once or twice each week. The Helms company ceased operations in 1969. The Marks Family purchased Helms Bakery in the early 1970s and since then, they have transformed and completed a rare feat in Los Angeles - successful adaptive reuse of a historic structure. Covering the 11 acres, the many improvements include restoring original neon signs on the roofs, creating two historic murals, installing two large Photovoltaic solar arrays, restoring the Zigzag Moderne detailing, reinventing retail, home furnishings and eateries, as well as creating a home for top-flight media and arts related companies. To honor the history of the Bakery, a small museum was installed inside one of the retail stores. The closure of Helms Avenue to through traffic created a new pedestrian plaza giving the neighborhood a much deserved community space, Helms Walk. The closed portion of Helms Avenue has been developed with trees, lawn areas, a water feature, free Wi-Fi, music and basalt pavers creating a new found space – a meeting place to sip coffee, chat with an old friend or simply “remember the day”. Helms Bakery’s most recent addition closest to the Culver City station on the Expo Line is the newly created Helms Design Center. Featuring five to-the-trade contract showrooms with well-known brands such as Vitra and Carl Hansen & Søn, the center is a destination for commercial architects and designers. Lastly, a 200-car automated parking structure has been constructed, a first for Culver City, and in its making the Bakery continues to be a leader in civic mindedness with an eye to technological advances and innovations to the built environment and urban fabric. Retail stores now located at the Helms Bakery District include: Appliances, Plumbing, Design, Arcana: Books on the Arts, H.D. Buttercup, La Bella Cosa, Rejuvenation Lighting & House Parts, Room & Board, Scandinavian Designs (formerly Plummers) and The Rug Warehouse. Restaurants include Father's Office, Helms Bakery Cafe (Coming Soon), La Dijonaise, Let's Be Frank, Lukshon and New School of Cooking. The Helms Design Center includes Vitra and Carl Hansen & Son. There is now a Helms Bakery Collectors Club, established as a resource for Helms fans to obtain literature, memorabilia and even Helms Coaches."

  "text" : "Over the years there have been several versions of the AIMS (Australian Institute of Medical Scientists) Histology Discussion group, and for various reasons these have all had limited life spans. The current Histology Group of Victoria Inc. has evolved from a group which was created several years ago, driven by a committee predominantly comprising senior Histology personnel throughout Melbourne. The original committee comprised President: Tristan Roberts; Vice President: Sue Sturrock; Treasurer: John Mills; Secretary: Alan Sutton; Committee: Clare Christian; Irene Giouzeppos; Piero Nelva; Mike Rentsch; Clyde Riley; Ruth Wilkinson; Jane Witte. Their intent was to create a Histology group which catered to the needs of all people with an interest in Histology. This does not just mean medical scientists, which is why it was felt necessary to be independent of AIMS,like AACB (Australian Association of Clinical Biochemists) and ASM (Australian Society of Microbiologists), but unlike AACB and ASM, the primary concern is for local members, those in Victoria. Being affiliated with AIMS, however, has proven to be of mutual benefit to both organisations.In 1998, with Tristan Roberts at the helm, the Histology Group of Victoria (affectionately known as the HGV) became an incorporated group. The HGV Inc. still remains a non-profit organisation with over 500 members subscribing to its bi-monthly newsletter Paraffinalia.The HGV runs a number of educational scientific meetings throughout the year as well as social events. In 2007 the HGV \"gossip\" column \"Embed with Madonna\" was retired from the Bi-monthly newsletter Paraffinalia.Travelling Europe was the reason given for Madonna's \"retirement\". Madonna's farewell column was published in the June 2007 edition of Paraffinalia."

  "text" : "Happy Chef is a casual dining restaurant chain in the Upper Midwest, based in Mankato, Minnesota. It is known for serving breakfast throughout the day and is similar to Denny's, Perkins, and IHOP. The first Happy Chef Restaurant opened in 1963 in Mankato, Minnesota, and still operates today. At one time, the chain had 56 restaurants in seven states. However, consumer tastes shifted in the 1980s towards restaurants offering alcohol and multiple televisions, leaving a single restaurant in operation as of 2015. At one time, most of its locations had a big statue of a smiling man in a chef hat holding a spoon. Usually, these were at least eight times larger than life and would play recorded audio messages when a button was pushed. These became roadside icons. Today, only the original location in Mankato still has a Happy Chef statue. The older restaurants have wood frame and siding architecture with a \"tower\" like structure in front; the restaurant wings jutting out on either side and behind the tower. Variations include an A-shaped roof on either side of the tower, or the A-frame structure with vaulted ceilings inside. From the late 1960s to the early 1990s, flashing lights on this structure would draw roadside travelers in. The restaurants that still possess these structures do not use them anymore. Examples of these locations include Story City, Iowa; and Owatonna, Minnesota. Newer restaurants have a mansard roof with a gable on either side. Inside this gable is a round sign that says \"Happy Chef.\" At night, instead of flashing bulbs, a red neon light that runs the length of the roof is illuminated instead. Examples of these restaurants include Adair, Iowa."

  "text" : "Hawker Beechcraft Corporation (HBC) was an American aerospace manufacturing company that built the Beechcraft and Hawker business jet lines of aircraft between 2006 and 2013. The company headquarters was in Wichita, Kansas, United States, with maintenance and manufacturing locations worldwide. The history of Hawker Beechcraft originated in 1994 when Raytheon merged its Beech Aircraft Corporation and Raytheon Corporate Jets units. In 2006, Raytheon sold the company to a consortium of Goldman Sachs and Onex Corporation. This deal left the company with a heavy burden of debt which it struggled to support from the economic crisis of 2008 onwards. In April 2012 it defaulted on interest payments and was in breach of banking covenants; this caused widespread speculation that it would enter bankruptcy. On 3 May 2012, the company entered bankruptcy, filing voluntary petitions under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code in US Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy resulted in the company accepting an offer to be purchased by Superior Aviation Beijing. By 18 October 2012 the negotiations for the sale had failed and the company decided to cease jet production and exited bankruptcy on its own on 19 February 2013, under a new name, Beechcraft Corporation."

The company was founded in 1900 in Brooklyn, New York by Caleb Stillson Hammond, who had previously headed Rand McNally's New York City office since 1894. It was formally incorporated in 1901 as C. S. Hammond & Co. and moved to Manhattan. It soon relocated to a warehouse in Maplewood, New Jersey that was near Hammond's family home. During its heyday in 1950s and 1960s it was second only to Rand McNally. Until the advent of digital mapping from Google Earth predecessor Keyhole in the mid-2000s, it provided the mapping technology for CNN and Headline News. The company was privately owned by the Hammond family until its assets were acquired by Langenscheidt Publishers Inc. in 1999."

In 2008, the company proposed 2 more HD channels, Diversion HD & Canada HD, as well as a non-HD network, Diversion. However, the applications for the channels was denied by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). In 2010, the company was set to launch yet another channel (non-HD), The Wedding Channel. High Fidelity HDTV signed exclusive content deals with IMAX (giving them access to their original films), Smithsonian Networks & Off the Fence, an independent production company that distributes non-fiction content worldwide. On December 21, 2011, High Fidelity HDTV announced that it had entered into an agreement to be purchased outright by Blue Ant Media, majority owners of Glassbox Television and minority owners of Quarto Communications. While initially purchasing 29.9% of the company, the remaining 70.1% would be purchased following its approval by the CRTC. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2012. As of 2013, the company no longer exists, the 4 channels are now part of Blue Ant Media & the other proposed channels were never launched."

A connection to Cottingham, Beverley, Driffield and Bridlington was made in 1846 with the opening of the Hull and Selby Railway (Bridlington Branch), now part of the Yorkshire Coast Line; a new 4½ mile route into Hull was opened in 1848, along with a new main station, Hull Paragon; a connection to Market Weighton from Barlby near Selby was made in 1848 (closed 1954, see Selby to Driffield Line); an urban branch line terminating in east Hull, the Victoria Dock Branch Line was opened in 1853 (closed 1968); a connection at Gilberdyke onto the Hull and Doncaster Railway passing via Goole was made in 1863; and in 1871 North Eastern Railway's York and Doncaster Branch opened in 1871, with its northern half branching from the line towards York just east of Selby. From 1845 the Hull and Selby railway company was jointly leased by the York and North Midland Railway, and Manchester and Leeds Railway; the lease passed to the North Eastern Railway in 1854 who then acquired the company in 1872. Ownership then passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923, and to British Railways in 1948. As of 2015 the line is in use, and is owned and maintained by Network Rail. It is an important mainline on the UK rail network, and used on rail services out of Hull by Northern, TransPennine Express, Virgin Trains East Coast, and Hull Trains with destinations including Leeds, Doncaster, Sheffield, Goole and London, as well as freight traffic from the Port of Hull."

In 2012, the company had celebrated its 20th anniversary and employed more than 500 employees. In early 2014, Hoveround laid off 20 or more workers at its Sarasota County headquarters offices. The worker reduction brought the total number of employees in the region within a range of only 290 to 295.According to spokespeople, competitive bidding at Medicare and the need for the company to trim payroll prompted the lay offs of staffers from throughout the organization."

The company had hoped to return service to Nawiliwili Harbor on Kauaʻi and additionally planned to eventually provide service to Kawaihae Harbor on the Big Island. Ferry operations were suspended in March, 2009 after the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that a state law allowing the Superferry to operate without a second complete environmental impact statement was unconstitutional. The company went bankrupt as a result of these actions preventing service in Hawaii. On July 2, 2009 a Delaware Bankruptcy Court granted the company's motion to abandon both the ships Alakai and Huakai, ending all possibilities that the company might return to Hawaii; the ships were bought by the US Maritime Administration in 2010. The United States Navy eventually purchased the craft for a total of $35M, a small fraction of their original $180M cost."

  "text" : "HDIL is a listed real estate development company in India, with significant operations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. HDIL's business focuses on Real Estate Development, including construction and development of residential projects and, more recently, commercial and retail projects, Slum Rehabilitation and Development, including clearing slum land and rehousing slum dwellers, and Land Development, including development of infrastructure on land which the company then sells to other property developers. HDIL has an integrated in-house development team which covers all opment from project identification and inception through construction to completion and sale. Since incorporation in 1996, HDIL has developed 23 projects covering approximately 19,290,000 square feet (1,792,000 m2) of saleable area, including approximately 12,730,000 square feet (1,183,000 m2) of land sold to other builders after Land Development, primarily in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. HDIL also have constructed an additional 1,900,000 square feet (180,000 m2) of rehabilitation housing area under slum rehabilitation schemes. HDIL's residential projects generally comprise groups of apartments, towers or larger multi-purpose \"township\" projects in which individual housing units are sold to customers. The commercial projects are a mix of office space and multiplex cinemas. The retail projects focus on shopping malls. They usually follow a \"build and sell\" model for the properties they develop. HDIL also undertakes slum rehabilitation projects under a Government scheme administered by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), whereby developers are granted development rights in exchange for clearing and redeveloping slum lands, including providing replacement housing for the dislocated slum dwellers. The company has also won the prestigious Mumbai Airport Slum Rehabilitation Project to rehabilitate the slum dwellers located on 276 acres (1.12 km2) of Mumbai Airport land. Although historically HDIL has focused on real estate development in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, as part of their growth strategy they are considering projects in other locations, including Kochi and Hyderabad. They also are considering expanding into hotel projects, special economic zone(SEZ) developments and \"mega-structure\" complexes, which are large-scale mixed-use retail, commercial and residential developments. HDIL's total land reserves comprise approximately 124,800,000 square feet (11,590,000 m2) of saleable area to be developed through 35 Ongoing or Planned projects. HDIL's turnover from sales of projects, developed land and land development rights for the financial years ended 31 March 2008, 2007, 2006 were Rs. 2380 crore, Rs. 1204 crore, Rs. 434 crore, respectively, and the restated profit after tax for financial years ended 31 March 2008, 2007 and 2006 were Rs. 1409 crore, Rs. 743 crore and Rs. 1,172 crore respectively. HDIL launched an IPO in July 2007 and is currently listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE)."

  "text" : "The A.H. Heisey Company was formed in Newark, Ohio, in 1895 by A.H. Heisey. The factory provided fine quality glass tableware and decorative glass figurines. Both pressed and blown glassware were made in a wide variety of patterns and colors. The company was operated by Heisey and his sons until 1957, when the factory closed. The company also made glass automobile headlights and Holophane Glassware lighting fixtures. Heisey glassware is readily identifiable by its high clarity and brilliance. It is highly finished through the process of firepolishing, with polished bottoms. Many of the pressed pieces appear to be cut crystal on casual inspection, due to the high quality of the glass and the crispness of the molding. The majority of the pieces are impressed with the company logo, a raised capital letter \"H\" inscribed in a diamond of approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) in length. This mark is found on the bottom of most large pieces and on the base or stem of drinking glasses and compotes. Heisey glass is highly collectible and widely available in antique stores across North America and online auctions such as eBay. Popular pattern names include Crystolite, Greek Key, Empress, Plantation, Ridgeleigh, Stanhope, Old Sandwich, and Yeoman, amongst dozens of others. Heisey glass was produced in colors throughout the life of the factory, but the most prolific period of color manufacturing was from 1925 to 1938, when the most collectible colors were created. The company went to great lengths to produce distinct colors, and Heisey glass may often be identified from the specific colors alone. In 1925, Flamingo (a pastel rose-pink) and Moongleam (a vivid green) were introduced and produced in large quantities. Marigold is a brassy gold-yellow color. Sahara, which replaced Marigold, is a satisfying soft lemony yellow color. Hawthorne is a lavender color. Tangerine, a bright orange-red produced from about 1933, was part of a trend to darker, more vivid colors. During this time, a Cobalt color called Stiegel Blue was also produced. Alexandrite is the rarest of Heisey colors; it can be a pale blue-green under normal light, but in sunlight or ultraviolet light, it glows with a pink-lavender hue. Zircon is a very modern grey-blue and was the last new color introduced. Heisey is believed to have made a few pieces in milk glass in its early production years and likely produced vaseline glass as well in the early 1920s, although not in large quantities. At the time the factory closed, the Imperial Glass Company bought the molds for the Heisey glass production and continued producing some pieces mostly with the Imperial Glass mark until they went out of business in 1984. Many of these pieces were animal figurines, mostly in new or original colors using the old molds."

  "text" : "Hillside Family of Agencies  is one of the oldest family and youth non-profit human services organizations in Western and Central New York, USA. The agency started as Rochester Female Association for the Relief of Orphans and Destitute Children in 1837. The first year 46 children were served. The organization was renamed the Rochester Orphan Asylum in 1839, the organization constructed a larger facility in 1844 at Hubbell Park. In 1905 the group moved to the current Monroe Ave site. To reflect the shift from providing a home for orphans to caring for “dependent and neglected children,” the Rochester Orphan Asylum changed its name in 1921 to Hillside Home for Children. Another name change came in 1940 when Hillside Children’s Center was adopted and a goal set: “for every child, a fair chance for the development of a healthy personality”. During World War II Hillside Children's Center worked with Eastman Kodak to help the children of Kodak employees in England. Between 1940 and 1942, 156 British children were brought to the Rochester area by Kodak to safeguard them from the war in their home country. Hillside assisted in placing these “Kodakids,” as they were called, with the families of local Kodak employees or in foster homes for the duration of the war. In 1965, Hillside broadened its mission to helping “dependent, neglected, learning disabled, emotionally disturbed, socially maladjusted, and delinquent” children. During the 1970s, Hillside Children’s Center experienced great growth. The institution began its conversion to a residential treatment center and reopened its campus school, which had been closed since 1931. In 1996 a new parent organization, Hillside Behavioral Health System (HBHS), was formed in order to provide services more efficiently and effectively. Hillside Children’s Center and Hillside Children’s Foundation served as partner affiliates. In 1996 the Wegmans Work Scholarship Connection joined Hillside to become Hillside Work Scholarship. In 1999, Hillside Behavioral Health System added to its family when Crestwood Children’s Center and Crestwood Children’s Foundation affiliated with it. Hillside Family of Agencies was adopted as the system name in December 2000 to better represent the diversity of services provided by each affiliate. In 2004 Hillside absorbed Snell Farms Children's Center and Adoption Resource Network, Inc. Headquartered in Rochester, New York, the organization works with youth and families facing a wide range of behavioral and emotional challenges. Hillside Family of Agencies employs more than 2,200 staff working out of multiple in New York and Maryland and Washington D.C.. 12,636 Families are served by HFA."

In 2011, Healthways acquired Navvis & Company, a St. Louis-based firm providing strategic counsel and change management services both to enable its healthcare system clients to become future-ready clinical enterprises and to align the incentives for all stakeholders. Their partnership is now called Navvis Healthways. In 2013, Healthways and The Lampo Group, Inc. — headed by Dave Ramsey — entered into an exclusive agreement for Healthways to deliver the CORE Financial Wellness program as part of its Well-Being Improvement Solution. This program is known as Healthways Financial Well-Being, Powered by Dave Ramsey. Also in 2013, Healthways contracted with Dean Ornish to operate and license his Lifestyle Management Programs.

Until March 2014, it was 21% owned by Kingfisher plc, a UK company, who also own the B&Q and Castorama DIY chains. Kingfisher sold off the interests as it was planning expansion in new markets that would be in direct competition with Hornbach. Kingfisher has since launched its Screwfix stores in Germany and Brico Dépôt stores in Romania, where Hornbach operates. In the full fiscal-year 2007/2008 the net profit slumped 24% to 48 Mio. € after the company spent more on advertising and new stores."

  "text" : "The Hackett was an automobile built in Jackson, Michigan, United States, by the Hackett Motor Car Company from 1916 to 1919. Englishman Mansell Hackett had founded the Disco Starter Co. in Detroit. As an ancillary business, he bought small, near-defunct American automobile manufacturers, and either split them up and sold the parts, or refurbished them as a whole. One of these companies was the Argo Motor Co owned by Benjamin Briscoe. Mansell decided to keep this enterprise, and become a car manufacturer himself. So, it was reorganized as the Hackett Motor Car Co. Some financing came from a ship building family in Ferrisburg, which resulted in J.S. Johnston becoming president of the company, and Hackett it's general manager. The Hackett was an assembled car, powered by a four-cylinder, side-valve G.B.&S. engine with a Carter carburetor, and a displacement of 178.8 c.i. (3078 cm³). It delivered 22.5 bhp (16,8 kW). The car had a conventional frame with a wheelbase of 112 in (2845 mm), and was quite obviously patterned after the Ford Model T. At first, the Hackett was offered as a 5-passenger touring car and a 4-passenger roadster, each priced at $888. In 1918, the ladder was replaced by 2- and 3-passenger variants, and a 5-passenger \"All Seasons Touring\", which meant either a touring car fitted with a removable \"winter\" or \"California\" top (as period Dodge cars were offered¨with), or a fixed roof with removable side panels and windows for summer use. Following a forced production interrupt due to war material shortages, operations were transferred to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Chief engineer Fred M. Guy worked since 1910 on a \"valveless\" engine with rotating, gear driven discs, thus eliminating camshaft and valve springs. He and Otto W. Heinz had a four-cylinder prototype working in 1919, when the company was closed after another, ill-fated reorganization. Mansell returned to his earlier business of manufacturing starters, and Guy and Heinz went to Ypsilanti, Michigan where they joined forces with Apex Motor Corp., builder of the Ace car. Here, the Guy engine was reworked into a six-cylinder power plant, and saw limited production. Later, it led to the founding of the Guy Disc Valve Motor Co. in Ypsilanti. The premises in Grand Rapids were sold to the Lorraine Motors Corp., were a Herschell-Spillman powered, medium-sized car was built initially. Plans of David Dunbar Buick of building a larger Lorraine with an engine developed by him, using the IOE principle incorporated in the very first Buick did not materialize. In total, there were only about 118 Hackett cars built."

  "text" : "Heilig-Meyers was a retail furniture store chain founded in Goldsboro, North Carolina, in 1913 by two Lithuanian immigrants, W. A. Heilig and J. M. Meyers. Its corporate headquarters was in Richmond, Virginia. The chain grew to become the largest furniture retailer in the United States in the 1990s, ultimately having over 1,000 stores nationwide (including Puerto Rico). Its over-expansion—by purchasing over 100 McMahan's Furniture stores based in Carlsbad, California, in 1993, as well as other stores and chains in the West—contributed to its failure. The company also bought the L. Fish furniture chain in the Chicago area; those stores were closed in 1999. Heilig-Meyers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 17, 2000, and subsequently announced the liquidation of its inventory. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported in 2000 that the company failed when its large expansion did not succeed in creating sufficient revenue and when customers who had previously used the company's in-house credit began using credit cards instead. The company's credit customers had grown increasingly weary of lower quality. All of its stores were closed at the end of the year, except for its RoomStore-branded locations, which remained open. In 2005, RoomStore, the only part of Heilig-Meyers remaining, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy after receiving $35,000,000 to pay off its debts; RoomStore would be liquidated seven years later. The company, which had sponsored NASCAR Winston Cup drivers Bobby Hillin, Jr., Dick Trickle and Mike Wallace, was one of the last furniture companies to finance its own accounts. The last CEO/President was Bill DeRusha."

Huff-Daland produced a series of biplanes as trainers, observation planes, and light bombers for the U.S. Army and Navy. In 1924, Huff-Deland developed the first application of a crop duster in service with a subsidiary Huff Daland Dusters formed to run operations. Through mergers and acquisitions, the company became a founding component of Delta Air Lines. In 1927, the corporation was taken over by Hayden, Stone & Company, a New York City brokerage firm and in the course of the merger it became the Huff-Daland Division of the Keystone Aircraft Corporation. A single example of the Huff-Daland XB-1 bomber became the Keystone XB-1B, after its original Packard 2A-1500 engines were replaced with Curtiss V-1570-5 \"Conqueror\" engines. The Improved -B aircraft had better performance than the original, but still didn't compare favorably to the other aircraft of the period and never entered production. Keystone merged with the Loening Company in 1928. By 1931, Keystone had become the Keystone Aircraft Division of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation."

Next came Brambly Hedge, a series of 30-minute specials based on the illustrated books for children by Jill Barklem, and Rubbadubbers, a series about bath toys that come alive. Pingu, a Swiss series about a family of penguins, was recreated with great success in 2003. The company also provided the CGI for the twelfth season of Thomas & Friends.

During the Second World War (1939–45) the YMCA in Horsham helped Horsham's people by providing care for Service personnel. This included the founding of a youth centre in North Street for young Canadians who were billeted in Horsham during the period. Youth programmes continued until the sixties when the Boys Club opened in Hurst Road. The YMCA chose to concentrate on their football programme at Horsham YMCA F.C. and to expand their operations into other social concerns that affected young people."

The company started with a small investment from the then-larger Heritage Group, which became entirely focused on the new web design firm. Former CEO Brad Stone told the Deseret Morning News that due to the growth of his firm and others near Provo (which is also home to a large Novell facility) that the company had to begin hiring telecommuting programmers in order to keep up with demand. The company was featured in a segment of the infomercial scam The Economic Report, which was hosted by sports anchor Greg Gumbel. The company closed for business on March 8, 2011 while leaving work on hundreds of customer websites uncompleted and owing millions to customers, vendors, employees, and the Internal Revenue Service."

The company orders crate engines from the dealership and then redesigns them.The company designs and builds upon numerous parts of the original car, such as tuning the car's engine, lowering the car, making a new body with more features, and installing racing tires. First car from the Hamann Motorsport was BMW M3 (E30), each producing 348 PS (256 kW) from a 2.3L R4 engine (with Turbocharger). The car accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds and reach top speed of 170 mph (273 km/h). Hamann Motorsports designed a variety of cars, for instance, the Lamborghini Murciélago LP640.

  "text" : "Handango was one of the first online software stores to sell mobile apps for personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones. Handango offered worldwide distribution, support, and e-commerce services to its partners. Company's customers include consumers, software developers, mobile operators, and original equipment manufacturers. Supported mobile devices include Android devices, Palm handhelds, Windows Mobile devices, Symbian OS devices, and BlackBerry devices. Handango was founded in 1999 by Randy Eisenman. Early founding employees of the company included Eric Matzinger, James Lowe, Andrew Blake, Gabe Bass, Will Pinnell, Rusty Butler, Lindsay Rall, Laura Rippy, Jason Wells, Dustin Brown and Bob Weber. Handango was a pioneer of mobile software distribution and is widely credited with many \"firsts\" in the distribution of mobile apps including a self-service developer management and reporting portal, the business model of a 70/30 developer revenue split, over-the-air distribution of software with palm}, the industry's first digital rights management deployed with Nokia, and the Handango Commerce Engine that facilitated ecommerce on behalf of the software developer directly from their Web site. Handango InHand, available since 2003 for Symbian UIQ, since 2004 for Windows Mobile and Palm OS, since 2005 for Blackberry and since 2006 for Symbian S60, is an on-device application store for finding, installing and buying software for your mobile device. Application download and purchasing are completed directly on the device so sync with a computer is not necessary. Description, rating and screenshot are available for any application. Software for using Handango InHand is available for free for Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Symbian UIQ & S60, Blackberry, Android. Handango pionereed this on-air business model for smartphones which achieved great success some years later with similar Apple Inc.'s App Store and Google's Android Market. On February 23, 2010, Jud Bowman of Motricity, a Durham, North Carolina supplier of software and games for mobile phones, acquired Handango, making PocketGear third behind Apple Inc. and Google in the app market. While PocketGear remained in Durham, the company kept the Handango offices in the Dallas, Texas area. PocketGear.com, LLC was started in 1998 by Nathan Miller as a teenager, and was later acquired by Motricity. Bowman bought back the smart phone application business in 2008 when Motricity moved from Durham to the Seattle area. Bowman remained a Motricity investor. In February 2011, Handango's new owner PocketGear, Inc. rebranded itself as Appia and shifted its focus to \"white label\" mobile app stores - i.e. on-device OEM-branded store apps. Handango's traditional website at www.handango.com as well as www.pocketgear.com appear to have been taken offline no later than December 2013."

Sheet-fed offset printing is used predominantly for high-quality, multi-colour products, such as catalogues, calendars, posters, and labels. Heidelberg produces equipment for prepress, press and postpress, and is the only company in the world that does so. On 23 February 2011, Heidelberg announced a partnership with Ricoh, entering into a global distribution agreement contract to sell and support the Japanese company's latest production digital colour press, the Pro C901, alongside their extensive offset press portfolio. Like much of the printing industry, Heidelberg has suffered and its employees have been subject to layoffs and pay cuts in past years. There is a subsidiarity called Adolf Mohr Maschinenfabrik GmbH & Co. KG."

In addition to the cartoons, the magazines also displayed black-and-white photos of pin-up models, including Bettie Page, Eve Meyer and stripper Lili St. Cyr, plus actresses, including Joi Lansing, Tina Louise, Irish McCalla and Julie Newmar. One of Martin Goodman's family members, Abe Goodman, headed this division. The line was published from at least the mid-1950s to mid-1960s. These titles were profitable for the company because the contents were inexpensive and production costs were minimal in comparison to the more complex full-size magazines published by the company."

  "text" : "Horex is a German motorcycle manufacturer. In 1920 Friedrich Kleemann (1868-1949), financial manager at the Rex Konservenglas Gesellschaft (preservative jar manufacturing company) in Bad Homburg (Germany) bought COLUMBUS MOTORENBAU AG, a small motor factory in Oberursel by Taunus, which was in the neighbourhood. The factory made the later Horex model and the name remained the same for almost 30 years. Fritz Kleemann, the son of Friedrich Kleemann, made the first cycles with a GNOM engine, delivered from the Columbus-Engine factory. In 1923 Fritz Kleemann (1901-1975), founded HOREX-FAHRZEUGBAU AG. He derived the name from his town HOmburg and his father's preservative jar company REX. He was also a motorcycle racer and was riding his own Horex machine. He built the first \"real\" Horex, a 248cc, OHV, that he tested himself on race. So, Horex was built for motorcycle riders by motorcycle riders. Horex built motorcycles with Columbus four-stroke engines from Oberursel. In 1925 Horex and Columbus merged. Horex developed a range of models with single-cylinder Columbus engines from 250 cc to 600 cc. In 1933 it added two parallel-twin models: the 600 cc S6 and 800 cc S8.

Helpline e-Services is a POS based Electronic Voucher Distribution (EVD) platform designed for the use of Retail Outlets – Hotels, Supermarkets, Pharmacies, Mini-marts, Eateries, Bookshops etc. The need to reduce the cost of printing and distributing recharge cards in Nigeria forced many telecoms operators to consider an alternative medium of distributing their air-time electronically. This need and also in keeping with the trends in developed countries of North America and Western Europe the company decided to invest in the development of Electronic Voucher Distribution (EVD) platform by using Helpline e-Box, equipped with GPRS technology to vend telephone air-time. This service called Helpline e-Services is a service targeting the pre-paid telephone billing system users that constitute more than 90% of the total phone subscriber base in Nigeria. The participating vendors includes hotels, supermarkets, cybercafes and eateries across the nation. The service started at inception on the platform of Visafone but later expanded to include Nigerian's second national carrier and GSM operator Globacom and CDMA network Starcomms Plc. A steady growth has been witnessed in the 3 years of operations and subscriber base currently stand at 7,000. Helpline has picked up several awards from Telecommunications service providers (operators) in Nigeria over the past four years."

Programs focus on primary health care, agro-forestry, food aid, emergency assistance, capacity building, training and sponsorship. All of HelpAge Canada's overseas programs are coordinated through local charitable organizations such as the Oblate missionaries, SOFEPADI, Ahero Joot Social Services, the Salvation Army and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They work in collaboration with other national and international nongovernmental organizations. HelpAge Canada obtains its funding from Federal and Provincial government sources, corporations and foundations, and individual donors to support their programs. Primary Government sources include Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Over 50% of their funding is raised through general donations and donations in-kind. Government income is used to supplement general donations. Administration costs were 2.7% in 2009-10, fund-raising costs were 6.2%. HelpAge Canada is governed by an elected volunteer Board of Directors. The Board also appoints Management Committees to advise the Executive Director, who is hired by the Board of Directors. The charity receives support and professional expertise through its affiliate membership with HelpAge International and through its membership with organizations such as the Alberta Wild Rose Foundation. Among the many issues tackled by HelpAge Canada are: \n*  Poverty among older people. \n*  Isolation and loneliness. \n*  International Development \n*  Microcredit \n*  Ageism Prevention \n*  Neglect Prevention \n*  Elder Abuse Prevention \n*  AIDS Prevention \n*  Disaster Relief"

  "text" : "HeadFirst Public Domain was a library of public domain software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron 8-bit computers. It also offered several discs of software for the Acorn Archimedes. It was set up in December 1992 by two friends, Gareth Boden and James Treadwell. Gareth Boden seems to have done the majority of the programming. The friends were just leaving school at the time. It was a bedroom enterprise and HeadFirst PD produced paper catalogues of its products. The catalogues invited people to buy discs full of public domain software from HeadFirst PD for £1.25 per disc. There are relatively few demos on the Acorn Electron and HeadFirst PD was unusual in that it released the majority of its software for the Acorn Electron, not the more-popular BBC Micro. Indeed, several of the better HeadFirst PD demos were Electron-only. The Invader Demo and the Vortex Demo were prime examples. There are several different 'versions' of some HeadFirst PD discs, as the demos were sometimes revisited and slightly improved. The early versions of the discs were superseded. The early HeadFirst PD catalogues, for example, typically had one demo per disc. By the latest catalogue, seven or eight demos – although not all were programmed by the two authors – were typically on a menu-driven disc. Not all games on HeadFirst PD discs were in fact programmed by HeadFirst PD. Many other public domain groups were going strong at the time, and each library 'borrowed' programs from the other. Some titles on HeadFirst PD discs also appear on BBC PD discs and Mad Rabbit PD discs. HeadFirst PD was closed down in 1995. The two friends were contributors to the Electron User Group magazine and the launch and demise of the library is documented in full between issues #7 and #23. The whole library of HeadFirst PD discs was 'lost' in 1995 when the library stopped supplying discs. In 2008, the library was re-discovered by Gareth Boden and was made available on the Acorn Electron World web site. The best known demos from HeadFirst PD remain the Invaders Demo and the Vortex Demo. Invaders shows a scrolling parallax stars backdrop with a simple space invaders game coupled with scrolling message. Vortex shows a spiral with interrupt-driven music and colour switching. HeadFirst PD also produced several games, and 'data-packs' to such popular professional titles of the day such as White Magic and Repton Infinity. In fact, their extension 'data-packs' are the only surviving fan-based extensions to these popular Electron games. HeadFirst PD also produced a spin-off library of images for use with the Stop Press 64 desktop publishing program."

Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. Therefore Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it lets the developer build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across all the languages – utilizing the dependencies and Procfile. The Procfile exposes an architectural aspect of the application and this architecture aims to help the developer scale each part independently."

  "text" : "HBOS plc is a banking and insurance company in the United Kingdom, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Lloyds Banking Group, having been taken over in January 2009. It is the holding company for Bank of Scotland plc, which operates the Bank of Scotland and Halifax brands in the UK, as well as HBOS Australia and HBOS Insurance & Investment Group Limited, the group's insurance division. HBOS was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax plc and the Bank of Scotland. The formation of HBOS was heralded as creating a fifth force in British banking as it created a company of comparable size and stature to the established Big Four UK retail banks. It was also the UK's largest mortgage lender. The HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 saw the transfer of Halifax plc to the Bank of Scotland, which was now a registered public limited company, Bank of Scotland plc. Although officially HBOS is not an abbreviation of any specific words, it is widely presumed to stand for Halifax Bank of Scotland. The corporate headquarters of the group were located on The Mound in Edinburgh, Scotland, the former head office of the Bank of Scotland. Operational headquarters were based in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, the former head office of Halifax. The group became part of Lloyds Banking Group through a takeover by Lloyds TSB on Monday 19 January 2009 after both sets of shareholders approved the deal. HBOS continues to operate as a separate organisation within the new group, although over time it is likely to be restructured. Lloyds Banking Group has stated that the new group will continue to use The Mound as the headquarters for its Scottish operations and will not cease the issue of Scottish bank notes."

  "text" : "The Holt Manufacturing Company traces its roots to the 1883 founding of Stockton Wheel Service in Stockton, California, United States. Benjamin Holt, who was later credited with patenting the first workable crawler tractor design, incorporated the Holt Manufacturing Company in 1892. Holt Manufacturing Company was the first company to successfully manufacture a continuous track tractor. By the start of the 20th century, Holt Manufacturing Company was the leading manufacturer of combine harvesters in the United States and the leading California-based manufacturer of steam traction engines. Holt Manufacturing Company operated from its base in Stockton, California, until opening a satellite facility in Walla Walla, Washington, to serve the Pacific Northwest. In 1909, Holt Manufacturing Company expanded by purchasing the facility of defunct farm implement maker Colean Manufacturing Company in East Peoria, Illinois. Holt changed the name of the company to Holt Caterpillar Company, although he did not trademark the name Caterpillar until 1910. The company's initial products focused on agricultural machinery and were distributed internationally. During World War I, almost all of its production capacity was dedicated to military needs. Its tractors were widely used by the Allies in place of horses to haul heavy artillery and tow supply trains. Holt tractors also played a part, to varying degrees, in the development of military tanks in Great Britain, France, and Germany. Holt's equipment was credited with helping the Allies to win the war, and its tractor was regarded by Colonel Ernest Dunlop Swinton as \"one of the most important military vehicles of all time.\" The Holt Manufacturing Company gained worldwide recognition for the quality and durability of its equipment. As the war ended, the Holt company was left with huge surplus inventories of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C. L. Best. The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment and sought to capitalize on the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward. Both the Holt Manufacturing Company and C. L. Best were hurt by the depression of 1920–21 which further inhibited sales. Both companies streamlined their over-lapping product lines. The two companies had spent about US$1.5 million (about $20,240,038 today) in legal fees fighting each other in various contractual, trademark and patent infringement lawsuits since 1905, but, on the advice of investors, the two companies merged in 1925 to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. As of 2010, Caterpillar Inc. was the 229th largest company in the world."

  "text" : "Honeywell Aerospace is the largest manufacturer of aircraft engines and avionics, as well as a producer of auxiliary power units (APUs) and other aviation products. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, it is a division of the Honeywell International conglomerate. It generates approximately $10 billion in annual revenue from a 50/50 mix of commercial and defense contracts. The company experienced a boom during World War II, when it equipped bomber planes with avionics and invented the auto-pilot. After the war it transitioned to a heavier focus on peacetime applications. Today Honeywell produces space equipment, turbine engines, auxiliary power units, brakes, wheels, synthetic vision, runway safety systems and other avionics. A Honeywell APU was used in the notable emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 and a Honeywell blackbox survived under sea for years against its specified limits to reveal the details of the crash of Air France Flight 447. The company was also involved in the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey and in 90 percent of U.S. space missions. It's involved in the U.S. NextGen program and Europe's SESAR program for advancing avionics. President Barack Obama awarded a Honeywell employee the National Medal of Technology for his contributions to air flight safety technology. The company owns dozens of patents related to NextGen technology, aircraft windshields, turbochargers and more. It was also involved in an 11-year-long patent dispute regarding ring laser gyroscope technology."

  "text" : "The Holy Land Foundation was the largest Islamic charity in the United States. Headquartered in Richardson, Texas, it was originally known as Occupied Land Fund.In December 2001, the U.S. government designated HLF a terrorist organization, seized its assets, and closed the organization. In 2004, a federal grand jury in Dallas, Texas charged HLF and five former officers and employees with providing material support to Hamas and related offenses. The prosecution's theory was that HLF distributed charity through local zakat (charity) committees located in the West Bank that paid stipends to Palestinians who targeted Israeli civilians, or to their families if they committed suicide during the act; that Hamas controlled those zakat committees; and that by distributing charity through Hamas-controlled committees, HLF helped Hamas win the \"hearts and minds\" of the Palestinian people. The first trial, in 2007, ended in the partial acquittal of one defendant and a hung jury on all other charges. At a retrial in 2008, the jury found all defendants guilty on all counts. The 2008 trial of the charity leaders was the \"largest terrorism financing prosecution in American history.\" In 2009, the founders of the organization were given sentences of between 15 and 65 years in prison for \"funneling $12 million to Hamas.\" The organization's website stated: \"Our mission is to find and implement practical solutions for human suffering through humanitarian programs that impact the lives of the disadvantaged, disinherited, and displaced peoples suffering from man-made and natural disasters.\""

They source out-of-the-ordinary products and offer something different, a range of toys and gifts that will appeal to many ages and tastes. What started off as a local toy shop at the Hawk Inn (hence the name Hawkin), became a niche mail order company in 1973, and since then has developed into a supplier of \"things you thought had gone forever and things you never even knew existed\". From 2007 up to the end of 2012, Hawkin’s Bazaar operated out of Beccles from The Old Aerodrome in Worlingham where the warehouse and head office were based. At the start of 2013 the company separated these two entities, with the warehouse moving to Eye, Suffolk and the head office to Norwich. The current contact address for the company is Hawkin’s Bazaar, 62-64 Yare House, Thorpe Road, Norwich, Norfolk, NR1 1RY. 2013 marks the company’s 40th year in business. Whilst a lot has changed since Hawkin’s Bazaar launched as a mail order service, the company still refers to its original values with taglines such as “Unusual gifts for every occasion, since 1973” and “Suppliers to Father Christmas since 1973” adorning their mail order catalogues and other communications. In addition to high street shops and mail order catalogues the company continues to operate online. Its website was updated and re-launched in August 2012. On 23 January 2012, Hawkin's Bazaar (and Tobar Group) were bought by Primary Capital from administration through a management buy-out. The company continued trading in 2012 and opened several additional stores towards the end of the year (some at previous sites). As of December 2012, the company has 27 stores open around the UK. During 2012 the Tobar Group achieved sales of over £20 million and employed 250 people."

It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by William \"Bill\" Redington Hewlett and David \"Dave\" Packard, and initially produced a line of electronic test equipment. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 to Q2 2013, after which Lenovo came to rank ahead of HP. It specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises directly as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also had services and consulting business around its products and partner products. Hewlett-Packard company events included the spin-off of its electronic and bio-analytical measurement instruments part of its business as Agilent Technologies in 1999, its merger with Compaq in 2002, and the acquisition of EDS in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4 billion in 2008 and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced the acquisition of 3Com, with the deal closing on April 12, 2010. On April 28, 2010, HP announced the buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion.

The split closed on November 1, 2015, and resulted in two publicly traded companies: HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise."

  "text" : "Hecla Mining is a silver and other precious metals mining company based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Hecla Mining was founded in 1891. It was prominent in what became known as the Silver Valley of Idaho, which had the second-largest deposits of silver in the country. In 1983 this area was designated as a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency, because of land, water and air contamination produced by a century of mining. In June 2011 Hecla Mining settled an environmental suit under the Superfund statute, filed under CERCLA in 1991 by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, which was later entered by the United States and the state of Idaho. Under the settlement agreement, Hecla Mining will pay $263.4 million plus interest to the plaintiffs \"to resolve claims stemming from releases of wastes from its mining operations. Settlement funds will be dedicated to restoration and remediation of natural resources in the Coeur d’Alene Basin. The agreement, which was lodged in federal district court in Idaho today, brings closure to that lawsuit and establishes a strong basis for future cooperation between Hecla and the governments in the Coeur d’Alene Basin.\""

  "text" : "Hybrid Television Services (ANZ) Pty Limited (Hybrid TV) is the exclusive licensee of TiVo products in Australia and New Zealand. Hybrid TV is owned by New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ (33%) and Australian Seven Media Group (67%). The TiVo media device was launched in Australia in late July 2008. For twelve months running the device has been the number one selling HD-DVR in the category (GfK data). When the device was first launched its capabilities were primarily DVR functionality. Today the TiVo media device has free games (e.g. Sudoku) and services (e.g. horoscopes, weather, world clock) as well as new release movies on-demand delivered via the broadband connection. On-demand movies were launched in April 2009. In March 2009 the company began announcing partnerships with various internet service providers in an effort to provide unmetered downloads to customers. As the electronic program guide (EPG), software updates and broadband content and services rely on the broadband connection in the home - it was vital Hybrid TV created partnerships with ISPs. The first unmetered partner was Internode, following Internode was iPrimus and Adam Internet. Hybrid TV announced they would be launching in New Zealand in November 2009. Hybrid TV has established a local ISP partner in Telecom NZ for New Zealand. To date over 15,000 New Zealanders have registered their interest in the TiVo media device. During the three or so years prior to September 2014, promotion and sales of TiVo hardware in Australia declined to the point where most retailers discontinued selling TiVo. This was apparently due to a lack of interest from the 7 Network, Hybrid Television Services' dominant owner. 7 Network confirmed its withdrawal from the TiVo fold in September 2014 at about the same time as it combined with all of its free-to-air TV competitors in Australia to launch FreeView Plus, a hybrid TV service that is currently in its infancy and apparently doomed by poor promotion, equipment unavailability and technology choices aimed at ensuring viewers cannot skip advertising breaks. FreeviewPlus-branded equipment is not permitted to carry ad-skipping features."

  "text" : "Hayneedle began in 2002 with the purchase of a single online store, Hammocks.com, from a llama farmer in rural Washington state. Over the next few years, the company opened more online stores, each focused on one particular type of product, developing a portfolio of sites focused on indoor and outdoor home furnishings, accents, and decor. In 2005, the company unified under the name NetShops, and continued its category expansion. By acquiring Duluth, Minn.-based Thralow, Inc. in 2006, the company gained properties Telescopes.com and Binoculars.com, and underwent an internal restructuring. 2007 saw another corporate restructuring, more niche website expansion, and the acquisition of GiftBaskets.com. By this time, NetShops had launched and operated hundreds of online specialty shops. In 2009, the company rebranded as Hayneedle[2] and further expanded its selection to include more items focused in the areas of office, kitchen, bedding, pet supplies, lighting, home storage, and home improvement, among others. The company's website, hayneedle.com, is now positioned as the place to find everything home for every room, style, and budget, and offers a wide array of products and categories in one online store. In the spring of 2014, all of the sites previously in operation under Hayneedle, Inc. were rolled into hayneedle.com. On October 15, 2010, Hayneedle opened The Foundary, a website for limited-time sales of home products from designer brands. The site featured a limited-time, limited-quantity format, with 3 to 4 sales launching per day, each typically lasting 72 hours. The Foundary was a members-only website; membership was free. In 2013, The Foundary shifted emphasis and merged with Hayneedle to form the first Stylist in hayneedle.com's Style Gallery. The Style Gallery at hayneedle.com serves as a space for curated collections of furnishings and housewares focused on a number of different styles, each of which is categorized under a specific Stylist. Collections vary but many reflect current trends within the marketplace and are intended to provide a convenient shopping experience as well as inspiration."

  "text" : "Hypacoustic is a New Zealand Cinema Audio product. Its parent company, Arvus Group New Zealand was founded by Matthew and Julie Simmons. The Hypacoustic Speaker system began development in 2002, with significant government investment funding via the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, FRST. The primary difference between the Hypacoustic Speaker System and traditional cinema speaker systems is that the front Left, Right and Centre channel speakers are designed for placement around the screen rather than being placed behind a perforated vinyl screen. It had been assumed that the sound channels needed to be in physically the same position as the visual events they are co-ordinated with, but research has shown that the human brain will attribute a sound event to a salient visual cue. This has led to the common use of perforated screens in cinema, with the associated problems of reduced reflectivity and moire, which is an increased problem with already pixellated digital projection; and altered sound. Most home cinema already has speakers around the screen, not behind it. Traditional surround speakers radiate over 60 - 100 degrees. However, for accurate surround sound, a 360 degree radiation is required. Laser Pacific (a fully owned Kodak subsidiary based in Hollywood LA) had their current screening room Hypacoustic audio system installed on 17 January 2008."

When Hyundai Motor Company entered the Indian Automobile Market in 1996 the Hyundai brand was almost unknown throughout India. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. Maruti, Hindustan, Premier, Tata and Mahindra. Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market with Cielo just three years back while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back. For more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, Maruti Suzuki had a near monopoly over the passenger cars segment because Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products."

  "text" : "HomeGrocer.com, Inc. was one of the first online supermarket businesses, started in 1997 by Terry Drayton, Mike Donald, James Fierro and Ken Deering. HomeGrocer raised a total of $440M in investments from a who's who of investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Amazon.com, John Malone of Liberty Media, Martha Stewart and Jim Barksdale. HomeGrocer built and operated the first fully integrated Internet grocery operation. Unlike previous start-ups, HomeGrocer did not operate out of existing supermarkets, but instead built dedicated warehouse facilities where inventory was stored, orders picked and deliveries made using customized trucks. The first 50,000 sq ft (4,600 m2) facility opened in Bellevue, WA in early 1998 modeled on Costco warehouses and with low levels of automation. The product selection was a complete alternative to the traditional supermarket at comparable prices with an earned reputation for top quality fresh produce, seafood and meat. Deliveries were made in custom tri-temperature trucks with the distinctive HomeGrocer peach logo. Customer support was very strong and new facilities were opened in Portland, OR in May 1999, in Renton, WA in September 1999, in Irvine, CA in October 1999, in Fullerton, CA in January 2000, in Carson, CA in February 2000 in Asuza, CA in March, 2000, in San Diego, CA in April 2000 and in Dallas, TX in May, 2000. Each of these new facilities operated 7 days a week and were 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) with 50 delivery vehicles and a staff of 200. Daily sales reached over $1M per day by June 2000, at which time a total of 16 additional HomeGrocer facilities were under construction in markets including Atlanta, GA, Chicago, IL, Washington, DC. and Denver, CO. HomeGrocer developed all of its own technology including its award winning website, its wireless picking systems that used WiFi, and its driver \"smart phones\", all years before they were mainstream. HomeGrocer completed a $288M IPO in March 2000 underwritten by Morgan Stanley and DLJ but needed more capital to meet the aggressive roll out that was already well underway. With the onset of the dot-com crisis, this capital became unavailable at any price, thereby leaving the company few alternatives to survive. In September 2000, stockholders approved a $1.2B all stock buyout by the cash-rich competitor Webvan of the much larger HomeGrocer.com. HomeGrocer was rebranded to Webvan, the management team fired and the technology and processes converted to Webvan. The Webvan technology did not work very well and their execution was poor. Most telling, the eight different HomeGrocer facilities converted to Webvan saw overnight sales declines of one-third, then over 50% within two weeks and never recovered. Formerly profitable HomeGrocer facilities quickly ended up with significant losses. Studies of what happened after the merger were not kind to the original Webvan management  who spent over $500M before going bankrupt less than a year later. HomeGrocer sales peaked in November 2000 at over $1.5M per day making it the largest Internet grocery business ever created until UK based Ocado exceeded it in 2010. The HomeGrocer brand was purchased out of bankruptcy and eventually ended up being owned by Amazon. It exists today, but no longer sells perishables, such as fruits, vegetables, milk, and yogurt."

The catalog's success caused the company to begin opening retail stores using the brand name in 1985. By 1989, it had already opened 12 retail locations. By early 1991, the chain had opened 24 locations, mostly in California, though Williams-Sonoma president Kent Larson forecast as many as 100-150 total stores. Growth continued, and by 1993 the chain had expanded to 38 locations, with typical stores approximately 2,200 square feet (200 m2) in size. In January 2006, Williams-Sonoma announced it would be closing all 11 remaining store locations and the catalog, and moving the product lines to its other stores, including Pottery Barn and West Elm. It was reported the chain's sales had not met expectations and only accounted for a small percentage of Williams-Sonoma's revenue."

The company utilizes the nearby Harz mountains, a well-known nature reserve and tourist destination in Germany, as a source of high-quality drinking water. Water is impounded in six reservoirs built between 1930 and 1969 in the Lower Saxon part of the Harz mountains; drinking water is prepared in three waterworks and distributed through pipes to large parts of Lower Saxony. The system is supplemented by four groundwater waterworks on the North German plain. Currently delivering over 84 million cubic meters of water per year, the Harzwasserwerke supply a number of municipal utilities as far away as Bremen, Brunswick, Wolfsburg and Hanover, among others. The elevation difference between the Harz mountains and the North German plain makes the terrain very suitable for the production of electrical energy by means of hydropower. Several dams are operated by the company and thus make it an important producer of renewable energy. Having been founded as a publicly owned enterprise, the company was privatized in 1996. It is still performing a number of public and communal services that go beyond the portfolio of other water suppliers. Beside the management and administration of flood protection installations, perhaps most intriguingly, the company is also responsible for the maintenance of the Upper Harz Water Regale, which has been designated by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2010. Harzwasserwerke GmbH is currently managed by Renke Droste and Guenter Wolters as CEOs. The annual turnover for 2010 surpassed 40 million EUR, while profits soared to 6.46 million EUR (up 36.5 percent from 2009)."

  "text" : "Haldanes was a chain of mid-sized supermarkets that operated in the United Kingdom. Established in 2009, the company was the first mid-sized supermarket chain to start business in the United Kingdom in 27 years, having acquired stores from the Co-operative group and Asda, which were obliged to offload a number of stores following their acquisitions of Somerfield and Netto respectively, the latter branded as UGO stores. The chain was keen to promote their intentions towards supporting local communities, such as committing to sourcing at least 35% of its food and drink from local producers at each store and by supporting community events, a statement reflected in their tagline, \"Refreshingly Local\". The first of the Haldanes stores began trading from mid-November 2009. Haldanes went into administration on 10 June 2011 and ceased trading a few days later."

In 2010, B9 Coal in cooperation with AFC Energy and underground coal gasification developer Linc Energy commissioned a hydrogen fuel cell named Alfa System at the Chinchilla underground coal gasification facility. Combining these technologies allows usage of hydrogen, produced by the underground coal gasification process, as a feedstock for the fuel cell. In August 2010, B9 Coal proposed usage of combined underground coal gasification and alkaline fuel cells technologies at the Rio Tinto Alcan Lynemouth power station in Northumberland. In October 2010, AFC Energy, Powerfuel Power, and B9 Coal agreed to integrate AFC Energy's fuel cell technology with the integrated gasification combined cycle technology at the planned Hatfield power station at the Hatfield Colliery near Doncaster."

  "text" : "Hakunetsusha (白熱舎) was a company established by Shoichi Miyoshi and Fujioka Ichisuke, two of Japan's industrial pioneers during the Tokugawa / Edo Period. It specialized in the manufacture of light bulbs. The company was established in 1890, and started out by selling bulbs using bamboo filaments. However, following the opening up of trade with the West through the Unequal treaty, Hakunetsusha met with fierce competition from imports. Its bulb cost about 60 per cent more than the imports and the quality was poorer. The company managed to survive with the booms after the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, but afterward its financial position was precarious. In 1905 the company was renamed Tokyo Denki (Tokyo Electric) and entered into a financial and technological collaboration with General Electric of USA. General Electric acquired 51 percent share of ownership, sent a vice president, and provided the technology for bulb-making. Production equipment was bought from GE and Tokyo Denki soon started selling its products with GE's trademark.

In 1951 Joy Newton Houck Sr. (born 10 July 1900, Magnolia, Arkansas died 8 July 1999, Texarkana, Texas), owner of 29 Joy Theatres in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, teamed up with producer/director Ron Ormond and J. Francis White, owner of 31 cinemas in Virginia, North and South Carolina, to contract with independent film producers to create product for their combined theatre chains. Their initials, \"H, O, W,\" provided the name of the company. Initially Howco released Westerns from Ron Ormond's company featuring Lash LaRue, then moved into monster, science fiction and exploitation films. In 1954 Howco started a television distribution company called National Television Films. Howco released Roger Corman's Carnival Rock (paired with Teenage Thunder), Ed Wood's Jail Bait (paired with The Blonde Pickup, a reissue of 1951's Racket Girls), double features such as The Brain from Planet Arous and Teenage Monster (1957), and Lost, Lonely and Vicious and My World Dies Screaming (1958).

There is a stereotype-driven gap between how Latinos are talked about in official media and how Latinos view themselves, HS News exists and thrives in that gap. HS News was one of the first independent Latino news providers on the internet when it launched in 2010, quickly garnering critical audience mass. HS News is one of the most visited Hispanic web properties in the U.S., becoming a market leader in their competitive landscape. HS News borrowed its name from the country’s 43rd President George W. Bush who erroneously identified all things Latino as “hispanically”. In spite of the misnomer, the term suits the site’s lighter side the founders noted."

The Hoosier Salon Patron's Association, the nonprofit arts organization that organizes the event, also operates year-round galleries in Carmel, Indiana and New Harmony, Indiana. These spaces host exhibitions of Salon artists throughout the year, as well as workshops and demonstrations. An artist must have lived in Indiana and must be a member of the Hoosier Salon arts organization to become eligible for the Salon's exhibitions. The Hoosier Salon has exhibited art from many of Indiana's most notable painters, sculptors, cartoonists, and mixed-media artists, including Hoosier Group artists, several members of the Brown County Art Colony, and other artists with ties to Indiana. The Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the Chicago metropolitan area, hosted the first annual Hoosier Salon in 1925 at the Marshall Field and Company's galleries in Chicago. In 1942 the annual exhibition was relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, where it has been held at several venues, including the William H. Block Company and the L. S. Ayres and Company department stores, the Indiana State Museum, and the Indiana Historical Society. The Hoosier Salon has survived wars, economic recessions, a fire, venue changes for its annual exhibition, relocation of its offices and gallery spaces, and modifications to its outreach programs. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth continuous year of annual exhibitions."

  "text" : "Horizons Companies is a media content development and video production firm headquartered in Columbus, Ohio that creates and produces broadcast television programming, television and radio advertisements, web sites and other audiovisual elements for corporate, governmental and educational entities. The company was founded in 1984 by Donald A. Lee as Horizons Video and Film, and began operating out of small office in Upper Arlington, Ohio. In 1994, the firm changed its name to Horizons Companies and moved its operations into a former 1930's arc deco movie theater in Columbus, Ohio. The former theater, originally called the Arlington Theater, was opened on June 1, 1935 by Clarence MacDonald and its first feature presentation was West Point of the Air starring Wallace Beery, Robert Young, Maureen O'Sullivan and Rosalind Russell. The theater went dark in 1950, and was completely refurbished by Don Lee into a production facility with editing rooms, an audio recording suite and a 2,000-square-foot (190 m2) sound stage. The art deco elements of the theater were retained, however, as were the ticket booth and the holes in the wall of the projection room. In 1996, Horizons opened branch offices in Nashville, Tennessee and San Diego, California. Following additional growth in the 1990s, Horizons converted and moved into a 37,000-square-foot (3,400 m2) English manor previously owned by real-estate mogul turned convicted felon Albert J. DeSantis. Today, the company operates its production services out of what were once the horse barns, stables and riding arena on DeSantis' property. In 1999, Horizons produced an enhanced CD for the album Steady On by contemporary Christian music artist Point of Grace. The enhanced CD received the Gospel Music Association's Dove Award for Best Enhanced CD. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Horizons created a subsidiary music publishing and artist management company called Grandma Katherine's Music. This subsidiary produced a number of music CD's, including \"Unadorned\" (1997) and \"Breathe\" (2001) by Chuck Brown, \"Ghost Towns and Kingdoms\" (1999) and \"This Grand Parade\" (2000) by Fred Haring, Yankee Celtiac Consort's \"Wander the Wood\" (1997), John Morgan and Friends' \"Stories\" (1999). Additionally, Horizons produced CD albums for Watershed (\"Star Vehicle\", Thundercreek Records, 1998), and Tim Easton (\"Special Twenty\", Heathen Records, 1998), Neil Jacobs (\"World Blue\", Adena Productions, 1999). In 1997, Horizons produced an enhanced CD for contemporary Christian artists Caedmon's Call's \"Intimate Portrait\". Horizons Companies' growth and success was recognized in 2000 with founder/owner Don Lee being named as a Technology Finalist for the 2000 Columbus and Central Ohio Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. Between 2000 and 2006, Horizons Companies created and produced an episodic documentary television series about the history, tradition and personalities of Ohio State University football. The series, titled Buckeye Classics, was broadcast throughout the state of Ohio on network affiliate stations and on the statewide cable channel Fox Sports Ohio. During its run, the writer and editor of Buckeye Classics received several Emmy awards from the Ohio Valley Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2001, Horizons Companies was prominently featured as a case study in a college textbook for students of business and management. Chapters within the textbook included \"Horizons: A Values-Based Company With a Bright, Yet Challenging Future\", \"Horizons: Mission, Strategies for Growth, and Decision Making\", \"Horizons: The Importance of People, Human Resource Management, and a Strong Corporate Culture\", \"Horizons: Leadership, Communications and Motivation\", \"Horizons: Standing at the Crossroads\" Horizons Education, a division within Horizons Companies, creates educational media products for publishing companies. In 2003, a music video DVD for infants and toddlers,  Noodlebug: Animal Friends, was honored with a Gold Award from Parents' Choice, which reviews and recommends books and toys for children. In 2009, another Horizons Education product for elementary school students,  Snapshots: Simply Science, was recognized with a Distinguished Achievement Award by the Association of Educational Publishers. In 2004, Horizons Companies' camera crews were called upon to help document the Ohio campaign activities of presidential candidates John Kerry and George W. Bush for a feature film documentary entitled ...So Goes the Nation ."

  "text" : "Home Capital Group is a Canadian holding company. Through its subsidiary Home Trust Company, it provides Canadians a range of credit products including mortgages, credit cards and deposit services. It is regulated under federal legislation. Home Trust operates mainly in regions considered low risk where above average returns may be achieved; it also tends to focus on areas largely ignored by other mortgage lenders. During the 2008 economic crisis, it faced less competition (the number of competitors was halved over the last couple years) and its customer base is unique (overrepresented by people who have had credit problems). Mortgaged properties are residential and non-residential and include apartment and office buildings, hotels, construction and industrial complexes (retail mortgage lending which is also one of the main sources of organic growth, is at the core of the company's business). Much of the consumer lending business is done under the PSiGate banner (including credit cards). In 2009, its stock outperformed that of eight major competitors in the uninsured mortgage market. In 2010, it improved the technology used in data/information transfers, which increased the speed and overall efficiency of transactions. When the government of Canada added restrictions to mortgage lending, concerns were raised about new disruptions to Canada's housing market. Home Capital considered it beneficial to the market's overall stability. On November 25, 2013, Home Trust launched Oaken Financial to provide financial services directly to consumers through the Internet. On November 10, 2014, Home Trust announced that it intends to apply to the Minister of Finance to charter a Schedule I bank subsidiary to be called Home Trust Bank in English (\"Banque Home Trust\" in French). In July 2015, Home Capital Group suspended 45 brokers for creating mortgages with fraudulent income information, the estimated value of mortgages from the suspended brokers on Home Capital's books is $1.5-2 billion."

  "text" : "Hawtai (officially Hawtai Motor Group) is a Chinese automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Beijing, with production facilities in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, and Rongcheng, Shandong. Selling cars and SUVs under the Hawtai brand, from 2002 to 2010 the company had a joint venture or other form of legal cooperation with Hyundai Motors that manufactured Hyundai-brand passenger cars for the mainland China market; Hawtai continues to use some Hyundai technology today. As of late 2010, its production capacity was reported to be 350,000 units/year. What distinguishes Hawtai from rival private Chinese automakers is its diesel engine production ability. Billing itself as a clean vehicle brand, Hawtai also is a supplier to the Chinese State."

  "text" : "HackFwd was a German pre-seed company started in 2010 by Lars Hinrichs. HackFwd only planned to invest in developers with prototypes or demos for a fixed timeframe of 12 months. The timeframe was used to get to beta and create a viable business case. HackFwd claimed to provide a support structure doing all administrative work helping with finding advisors. Of the 30% equity stake that HackFwd takes, 3% were given back to the founders to distribute to advisors and mentors. HackFwd's headquarters were in Hamburg and the company intended to invest across Europe. HackFwd provided funding to startups of one to three people for a year. As of early 2011 funding ranged from 91,000 EUR to 191,000 EUR depending on the size of the founding team. The investment sizes are fixed and detailed on the website. HackFwd differed from many accelerators and incubators in that the startups invested in did not move to central location. Instead, they run quarterly events (called Build events) where all HackFwd members come together for feedback and expert mentorship sessions, which were designed to offer the most relevant support to startups in different phases of the program. Some of the material from the Build events were made public on the Where Passion Meets Momentum video website. HackFwd made most of the funding process transparent and released much material in the public, including a standardized contract called “Geek Agreement”, which details the terms of finance. While a startup could not directly apply to the program, they could find a person who is part of the referrer network (staff, founders, alumni, academia) and go through them. All referrers were listed on the website. HackFwd's business model evaluation tool Phase 2 Generator was also publicly available, and could be used to submit a business idea to a referrer, or privately as a tool for constructing and evaluating a business model. The company was shut down December 2013 due to its limited economical success."

This development system was available for both the Motorola 68000 family and PowerPC processors under the AmigaOS. Another product for the Amiga platform is the WarpOS which is a multi-tasking kernel for the PowerPC architecture developed by Haage & Partner in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Health Leads increases access to health and healthcare services by addressing the social and economic factors that contribute to illness. As a service provider, Health Leads is helping health systems to create models for integrating patient social needs into care, using a full spectrum of tools, including the Health Leads’ Desk, in which providers “prescribe” basic resources like food and heat, and well-trained student Advocates stationed in the clinics work side-by-side with patients to “fill” those prescriptions by accessing community resources and public benefits. In 2014, nearly 900 Health Leads Advocates connected over 13,000 patients and their families to the resources they needed to be healthy. More recently, Health Leads has been piloting new solutions (including technology, training, and implementation insights) that will enable health care organizations to address social needs in a range of care settings and with a variety of workforces. In addition to its work as a service provider, Health Leads works with health systems at the leadership level to build momentum in the sector for addressing patient social needs. In this role, Health Leads shines a light on innovation and best practices and participates in critical efforts around evaluation and value measurement."

It was founded in 2006 by Michael Austin, Jim Garbarini, Dave McCoy, Jeff Pobst, and Mark Terrano. In 2008, Hidden Path released its first original title, Defense Grid: The Awakening on PC and in 2009 on Xbox. A downloadable title, Defense Grid garnered high acclaim with its unique twist on tower defense and has sold over half a million units since its release. In 2009, Hidden Path began working with Valve Corporation to update and maintain the highly successful and critically acclaimed product, Counter-Strike: Source, first released in 2004. Hidden Path worked with Valve developing the newest entry in the Counter-Strike franchise called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. CS:GO debuted at PAX Prime 2011 and released on August 21 2012. CS:GO is available for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 (PlayStation Network), and Xbox 360 (Xbox Live Arcade). Continuing the company's trend of revisiting older series, Hidden Path released Age of Empires II HD on Valve's Steam platform in 2013, which serves as an updated version of Age of Empires II, released in 1999 by Ensemble Studios and Microsoft. In addition to updating the graphics and multiplayer capabilities of the base game and its original expansion, Hidden Path paved the way for a new expansion after 14 years called The Forgotten. According to Valve, the reason they are often collaborating with Hidden Path Entertainment, is that they have known them for a while and their offices are \"right around the corner\". Hidden Path has also contributed model work on Left 4 Dead 2. They also collaborated with Valve on the You Monster! expansion pack for Defense Grid which features the character GLaDOS from the Portal video game series."

Until 1988, Horten operated some of its department stores under the name of Merkur, some smaller department stores were called DeFaKa (Deutsches Familien Kaufhaus), but they had all been replaced with modern types of Horten department stores until the 1970s. In 1988 Horten introduced a new concept for their department stores, it was called \"GALERIA\"-concept and proofed to become a very successful venture for the Horten AG. Also in 1988, the Horten AG decided to separate their smaller locations, which should not be branded with the new GALERIA-design, and founded the Horten-Extra GmbH covering its thirteen smallest stores. It was planned to refresh the 39 bigger stores with the GALERIA-Design, but this goal has not been implemented. Horten-Extra was only a small division and ten of these stores were sold to Kaufring AG in 1993. Kaufring AG then re-branded these ten Horten-Extra stores to the fictional name J.Gg. Rupprecht, which had no history of its own. J.Gg. Rupprecht stores were never successful and one of the reasons, Kaufring AG filed for bankruptcy and finally went into liquidation. The few stores never made a profit and subsequently in 2001 all J.Gg. Rupprecht stores were closed, too late to rescue the Kaufring AG. The other three stores of Horten-Extra also did not have successful histories. The location in Dortmund was closed directly after the ten Horten-Extra stores were sold; it was renovated as a mall (Westfalen Forum). The Westfalen-Forum was from its beginning a \"dead mall\": the first and second floors were finished, but never opened because there were no tenants for those two floors. The basement also closed a year after its opening. The main tenant of the ground floor and basement (Adler fashion) closed in 2006.The other two Horten-Extra stores became part of Kaufhof (Neuss and Schwäbisch Gmünd) and were traded for a few years as Horten again, until the year 2000, when both stores closed because they were considered too small to be renamed Galeria Kaufhof. The 'Carsch-Haus' in Düsseldorf was the finest department store of the Horten AG and served as kind of a flagship store. It is now run by Kaufhof, but still trading as Carsch-Haus. This store has a very interesting and unique story, as in the 1980s it was dismantled stone by stone and later rebuilt only a few feet away. This became necessary because the 'Rheinbahn' (public transport in Düsseldorf) had planned to build a subway station under the building. After rebuilding, the Carsch-Haus became Horten AG's most modern department store and a model of development for the Galeria-concept. Horten was one of the most modern German department store companies of the 1960s and 1970s. Many new stores were built while the traditional, long-established high street stores were renovated, modernized, and in some cases, expanded. Horten built the first department stores that included car parks and petrol stations. They wanted to be the target for customers from the suburbs who had their first cars and did not want to travel into the cities by bus or tram. In addition to their large number of high-end downtown department stores, Horten built some new \"edge of downtown stores.\" Every department store featured a restaurant, most located on the top floor. In the 1960s they were called \"KUPFERSPIESS\" (Copper Kettle). Later, Horten began to reorganise them into self-service-restaurants and called them \"Bon appetit\" or \"Horten-Restaurant,\" also combined together as \"Bon appetit: Ihr Horten-Restaurant.\" In the 1990s Horten also began introducing the Galeria-concept for its restaurants and gave them a new food distribution sector and a lighter outfit. After Kaufhof took over Horten, they merged their two restaurant companies \"Bel-Terine\" and \"Bon appetit\" into one, dubbed \"DINEA.\" Smaller restaurants with less service were called \"Grillpfanne.\" Horten's dark brown interiors morphed into a more modern and fresh look with the introduction of the new Galeria stores in the 1980s, with an emphasis on lighter colors such as blue, light gray and white. Some of the bigger stores added food courts called \"delikatessa\" and also added onsite supermarkets. After returning from a visit to the United States and returning with the concept, Helmut Horten opened Germany's first supermarkets in the basement floors of his department stores. They were innovative, modern, and much larger than most German grocery stores at the time. In 1968 Helmut Horten sold all of his company shares and was never seen at celebrations of the Horten AG (like the 50th anniversary in 1986). Helmut Horten died in 1987, at this time his former company was part of BAT (British-American-Tobacco). In 1994 competitor Kaufhof took over Horten and - over a ten-year period - all Horten department stores were either renamed Kaufhof, sold or closed. This process ended in 2004 with the last stores being closed or renamed and the Horten name disappeared. Today only one store - the Carsch-Haus in Düssldorf - still has the Horten logo on its facade, struck in stone over the main doors. The former name \"Horten im Carsch-Haus\" was done away with in 1996. In 2008 Kaufhof cleaned the Horten stone-logos, and they are now clearly visible on the facade. The store now simply trades as Carsch-Haus and wasn't changed into Kaufhof. A Galeria Kaufhof store is located in the same street. In 1995 the Horten AG became a real estate company and rented the Horten-stores to Kaufhof. The operating business was transferred to the Horten GALERIA GmbH, which was later merged into the Kaufhof AG. Many former Horten and Galeria Horten department stores now trade as (Galeria) Kaufhof."

The menu items include humorously named items and the decor of the restaurants is flamboyant. Cross-dressing is common, with many of their locations hosting drag shows on weekends. Mary in the name is a reference to the slang descriptor \"Mary\" used for gay men as far back as the early 1900s. There are 13 Hamburger Mary's in the U.S. and one in Berlin, Germany as of 2015. Their Portland, Oregon location closed in late 2012 when they lost their franchise and their San Francisco location closed in 2013. Their Denver, Colorado location was renamed the M Uptown as the result of a franchise dispute in late 2015. Their main offices are in Chicago and West Hollywood, as of 2013. Hamburger Mary's has reopened in Denver, their new location is 1336 E 17th street."

  "text" : "Hamady Brothers was an American supermarket chain based in Flint, Michigan. The chain was founded in 1911 by Michael and Kamol Hamady, who were immigrant cousins from Lebanon and referred to themselves as brothers. The chain grew into a $100,000,000 sales company with 36 supermarkets and shopping centers. Michael Hamady was the first CEO and was followed by his son Robert in 1954, his grand-nephew Jack in 1967, and by his grandson Robert Lee in 1969. Robert Lee restructured the company and sold it to Alex Dandy in 1974. The family business is best remembered for sending truckloads of food to the strikers in the famous sit-down strike in 1937 of General Motors' Fisher Body plant that led to the recognition of the United Auto Workers by the auto industry. The chain expanded through Michigan in 1980 by purchasing 21 closed Kroger stores, primarily on the west side of the state. In 1985, Hamady bought two Hutch's supermarkets in Owosso, Michigan. As a result, an existing Hamady in Owosso was converted to a discount store called Price Rite. Hamady was purchased by Alex Dandy, who also owned Chatham supermarkets in Detroit. By 1988, the former Kroger locations, along with some former Vescio locations in Saginaw, Michigan, had closed. Hamady declared bankruptcy in 1988, and closed the last of its stores in 1991. Some of their locations were sold to Kessel Food Markets, which was founded in 1981 by former Hamady vice president Al Kessel."

  "text" : "Hartford City Glass Company was among the top three window glass manufacturers in the United States between 1890 and 1899, and continued to be one of the nation's largest after its acquisition. It was also the country's largest manufacturer of chipped glass, with capacity double that of its nearest competitor. The company's works was the first of eight glass plants that existed in Hartford City, Indiana during the Indiana Gas Boom. It became the city's largest manufacturer and employer, peaking with 600 employees. Many of the skilled workers employed at the Hartford City Glass Company were from Belgium, at the time the world’s leading manufacturer of window glass. The Belgian workers and their families accounted for over one-third of Hartford City's population during the 1890s, and lived on the city's south side. Because of the importance of the French-speaking Belgians, one of the local newspapers featured articles in French. In 1899, Hartford City Glass was acquired by the American Window Glass Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American window glass manufacturing capacity. During the next decade, the company began replacing its skilled and well–paid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian glass workers left town. During the 1920s, competitors developed new window glass production processes that eclipsed the American Window Glass technology, and the company lost its advantage. By the time the Great Depression struck, the Hartford City plant had closed."

Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013. Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence."

The chain went public in 1985, at which point it was the second-largest American electronics retailer behind Circuit City. Despite its number of locations, the chain began to experience financial troubles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, Highland hired an investment firm to decide the chain's future. At this point, it had also expanded into New York and Texas. Highland filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1992, and liquidated its last 30 stores in 1993."

  "text" : "Humanix Books is a book publisher that focuses on health, personal finance, business, self-help, and political topics. The company, originally called Humanics, was founded and has been continuously publishing since 1969, making it one of the oldest publishing houses in Southeastern United States. Initially based in Georgia, the first titles were developed in response to the need from the education community for quality classroom materials to support parents as the prime educators of their children. In the mid-1980s, Humanix expanded its focus to include titles specializing in personal development, philosophy, and management. Moving into the 21st century, the range of topics now includes health, religion, science, finance and politics. It published the best-selling book, The Tao of Leadership, by John Heider. In 2012 the company was acquired by Newsmax Media, Inc., a private multimedia company, rebranded to the name Humanix Books and relocated to Boca Raton, Florida. In 2012, the re-branded company published its first title, The ObamaCare Survival Guide, by Nick J. Tate. The book quickly became a number one New York Times Best Seller in the Advice, How-To & Misc. category for paperback books. The company has sold more than 500,000 copies of the ObamaCare Survival Guide. In 2013, Anthony Ziccardi, former vice president and associate publisher of Simon & Schuster, joined Humanix as publisher. Humanix Books operates the website, humanixbooks.com, and publishes approximately 8-10 new titles per year, still largely focused on the self-help and personal development genres. Humanix Books authors include financial experts Andrew Packer and Bill Spetrino, acclaimed cardiologist Dr. Chauncey Crandall, healthcare writer and specialist Nick J. Tate, Dr. Erika Schwartz, Charlotte Libov, Dr. Gary Small, and Dr. Russell L. Blaylock. Former Clinton advisor and political commentator, Dick Morris, has signed with Humanix for an upcoming book on the Obama administration due out in the fall of 2014."

  "text" : "Hjort (legally Advokatfirmaet Hjort DA, originally Harald Nørregaard, later Nørregaard & Bonnevie and Nørregaard & Hjort) is one of the leading law firms in Norway, headquartered in Oslo. It was founded in 1893 by Harald Nørregaard (1864–1938), a supreme court advocate who was also chairman of the Norwegian Bar Association and Edvard Munch's close friend, adviser and lawyer. In his lifetime, Nørregaard was one of Norway's preeminent lawyers. He was \"known for his eloquence in court. It was said of him that he dominated the courtroom with his very presence, and his warm voice settled around the High Court as velvet.\" For some years, the firm was a partnership consisting of Nørregaard and Thomas Bonnevie, who became a supreme court justice in 1922. In 1932 the young lawyer Johan Bernhard Hjort joined Nørregaard's law firm, and after WWII the firm was continued by Hjort and renamed Advokatfirmaet Hjort. As of 2013, the firm has 130 employees, and is owned by 36 partners."

  "text" : "(This article is about the company founded in 2013. For the original Hostess Brands, see Old HB. For the brand of snack cakes, see Hostess (snack cakes).) Hostess Brands, LLC is a bakery company formed in June 2013. It owns several bakeries in the United States that produce snack cakes under the Hostess and Dolly Madison brand names. It is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri and is owned by HB Holdings, LLC, which is owned by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company. The company is separate from Old HB, which was formerly known as Hostess Brands, Inc. from 2009–2013. Old HB is currently under liquidation and sold its cake business to Apollo and Metropoulos creating the current Hostess Brands. The current Hostess Brands was formed as New HB Acquisition, LLC to acquire the cake business (Hostess and Dolly Madison brands) of Hostess Brands, Inc. Following the conclusion of the sale, Hostess Brands, Inc. became Old HB, Inc. and New HB Acquisition became Hostess Brands, LLC. In June 2013, Hostess Brands retained the same public relations and advertising firms that had previously worked for Old HB. Bernstein-Rein in Kansas City, Missouri' will do Hostess Brands' advertising; LAK Public Relations in New York will handle its public relations for the return of Hostess products. The company officially restarted production of snack cakes on June 6, 2013, with products officially going on sale on July 15, 2013. Of the eleven bakeries operated by Old HB, Hostess Brands retained four, in Columbus, Georgia; Emporia, Kansas; Indianapolis, Indiana and Schiller Park, Illinois. The Schiller Park facility later closed, in October 2014. In the summer of 2015, Hostess began producing Hostess brand bread and buns. The company, which previously owned Wonder Bread, never produced bread under its own brand name. The new Hostess bread items are carried at certain drug stores and dollar stores. In July 2016, Hostess announced it would be going public in an offering valuing the company at $2.3 billion. The deal would see Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company become minority owners, with The Gores Group taking a majority ownership position in the firm."

Horizon has so far focused its efforts on the commercialization of sub-kW fuel cell solutions, which consume less hydrogen and thus rely less on the existence of a hydrogen station infrastructure to succeed in the market. By following an incremental strategy that centers around practical on-demand hydrogen fuel supply solutions with decreasing costs, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies has grown to become the world's largest volume producer of fuel cells below 1000W, serving customers in over 65 countries with what is the widest selection of commercial products in the fuel cell industry."

  "text" : "Helpshift is a privately held mobile software company based in San Francisco, California founded in 2011 by Abinash Tripathy and Baishampayan Ghose. On October 30, 2012, the company debuted the private beta version of its mobile customer service platform and announced that it had raised a US $3.25 million seed round of funding from True Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners. According to TechCrunch, the Helpshift platform consists of a mobile-focused SaaS solution, which aims to be “the first embedded support desk for native apps,” allowing developers to capture device info from their users so that they can troubleshoot problems quicker and more effectively. Tripathy says that the startup’s goal is to enable businesses and development teams to be able to fix issues before they turn into “tickets” by offering built-in, self-service features. Helpshift looks to eliminate problems before they get to a support email in a few ways: it allows users to easily search FAQs from their phones, rather than scroll through all of the answers and if that doesn’t work, users can send a note that will automatically attach their device details so that they don’t have to type them out. Then, they are directed to an in-chat text-message like session with a representative. On May 29, 2013, Helpshift announced the general availability of its platform, enabling app developers to download the full SDK without needing to pre-register for access. On July 9, 2013, Helpshift competed in and won the VentureBeat MobileBeat Innovation Showdown, for its unique approach to in-app customer care. In June 2014, the company closed a series A funding round of $10 million, bringing total funding to $13.2 million. The funding round was led by Intel Capital with participation from Visionnaire Ventures and existing investors True Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners In June 2016, the company raised another $23 million, let by Microsoft and Salesforce Ventures"

In April 2006, Hotels.nl launched their sheep advertising campaign. Although they were not the first to utilize sheep for advertisement, they were the first to do so in the Netherlands. The sheep were equipped with royal blue waterproof blankets with the company’s logo printed on them. The insulation on the blankets is washed in citronella, to repel parasites. Though it brought a smile, the Mayor of Skarsterlan, Bert Kuiper, fined the company 1,000 euros a day for violating the town’s ban of highway advertisement. Thanks to the sheep, in 2007, AMMA awarded Hotels.nl for having the best media stunt of the year for 2006. In 2012, Hotels.nl partnered with Noordlease for customers to lease the VW Up, equipped with Hotels.nl’s logo on the side. The website is available in Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish and is affiliated with over 2000 different hotels."

  "text" : "Honda Aero, Inc. (HAI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., is headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina at the Burlington - Alamance Regional Airport. The Burlington facility will serve as the primary production location for engines developed and marketed by GE Honda Aero Engines, LLC (a joint venture between Honda Aero and GE), beginning with the GE Honda HF120 turbofan engine. Development of the facility represents a $27 million capital expenditure by Honda, bringing the company's total North American capital investment to more than $9 billion. Production will begin with the GE Honda Aero Engine HF120. GE Honda HF120 Turbofan History \n*  Honda R&D began research into aircraft jet engine technology at the Wako Research Center in Japan in 1986. Development efforts involved the creation of several prototype engines, including the HFX01 (1995), HFX20 (1996), HF118-1 (2000) and HF118-2 (2002). \n*  The HF118 powered the prototype HondaJet, developed by Honda, on its first flight in December 2003, and in all subsequent flights up to the present time. \n*  July 2004 - Honda Aero, Inc. (HAI), a new Honda subsidiary, was established to manage Honda's aircraft engine activities in the U.S. \n*  October 2004 - Honda Aero, Inc., and GE established GE Honda Aero Engines, LLC, a 50-50 joint venture company responsible for certification, commercialization, establishment of manufacturing infrastructure, and support activities for the GE Honda HF120 turbofan engine and its derivatives in 1,000 to 3,500-pound thrust class. \n*  October 16, 2006 - GE Honda Aero Engines debuted the HF120 engine, a higher thrust successor to the HF118, at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) convention in Orlando, Florida, announcing that it had secured orders for the engine from Honda Aircraft Company, Inc., maker of the HondaJet advanced light jet; and Spectrum Aeronautical, maker of the Spectrum Freedom business jet. \n*  July 17, 2007 - Honda Aero announced plans to establish its headquarters and jet engine manufacturing facility in Burlington, North Carolina, beginning with production of the GE Honda HF120 turbofan engine. \n*  October 19, 2009 - The first GE Honda HF120 engine has successfully started its initial test run at GE Aviation’s altitude test chamber in Evendale, Ohio, launching the test phase of the program. \n*  May 20, 2013 - GE Honda Aero Engines announced today it is nearing completion of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification testing on its HF120 engine. In the last six months, the HF120 engine successfully completed crosswind testing and the 150-hour block endurance test. The final remaining test, the medium bird ingestion, is scheduled for completion in July. More than 95 percent of the certification documents to the FAA have been submitted with more than 84 percent already approved. \n*  December 13, 2013 - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded Part 33 certification to GE Honda Aero Engine's HF120 turbofan engine, certifying its airworthiness and setting the stage for the production of this all-new engine. The HF120 engine's airworthiness certification follows an extensive ground and flight test program that involved 13 engines. During its certification program, the HF120 engine accumulated more than 14,000 cycles and 9,000 hours of testing. Assembly is currently under way at GE's facility in Lynn, Mass., which is responsible for initial production. Production will transition to the Honda Aero Inc. facility in Burlington, N.C., next year."

Health World’s mission is to promote health and safety education by providing children with the information they need to build healthy lives. Health World was founded by a group of community residents led by Peter Rusin, CEO of JFK Medical Center at the time. The rising number of health-related issues confronting children and adolescents concerned this group of community leaders. They chose to focus and build health curriculum dedicated specifically to the needs of children pre-K through 8th grade. In 1995 Health World opened the $12 million, 85,000 square foot children’s museum ‘JFK Health World’ in Chicago, Illinois. Health World has since taught over 4,000,000 kids about making healthy choices. The museum would teach kids about making correct health choices, as well as give safety information and lectures to kids, such as teaching the Heimlich maneuver. In 2006 Health World expanded its regional education efforts when it closed the museum and transitioned to outreach education. In 2013 Health World made its preK-8th grade programs and education resources available nationwide via an online eLearning platform. Currently Health World programs are being utilized by educators in all 50 states."

Founded by Eldad Hagar and Audrey Hagar, this all-animal rescue organization rescues suffering animals that are facing death or extreme danger. This organization pays for all medical costs, and works in tandem with other animal organizations to rescue and foster abused and suffering animals, and eventually find them permanent loving homes once healed. Since 2008, Eldad and Audrey have been running this two-person non-profit animal-rescue organization, full-time. During its early years, Hope for Paws started operating low key on the streets but quickly gained a number of loyal followers and supporters around the world when Eldad posted a 3-minute, 41-second YouTube video of a blind dog named Fiona. One of the Hagars' most effective ways of raising awareness is filming their rescue missions and sharing the incredible transformations the sick animals made after being cared for. The videos have proven to be a powerful tool for getting donations and driving awareness about Hope for Paws. Hope for Paws and Fiona have appeared on Anderson Cooper's with co-host Kristin Chenoweth. Celebrity host Ellen DeGeneres has tweeted about Miley, a malnourished stray that had been barely surviving in a trash heap and had severe mange, parasites and a bacterial infection. The videos of the rescues are uploaded on YouTube by Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel. On this YouTube Channel, you can view the rescue of many dogs in tough situations. You see the before and after pictures of each dog at the end of the videos."

  "text" : "Haxi is a free shared transport application that enables users to share transport on short and mid range distances. The name is a portmanteau of \"hack\" and \"taxi\". Registered users can be drivers, passengers, or both. Unregistered users cannot get contact details on other users. No registration is needed to logon. The firm's mobile applications facilitates peer-to-peer ridesharing by enabling passengers who need a ride to request one from available \"community drivers\". Haxi was created by Aleksander Soender, Joonas Kirsebom and Robert Daniel Nagy in October 2013. By December 2013, the web service was launched in Stavanger, Norway. Haxi released applications for Android and iPhone in March 2014. The service is available in English, Spanish, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish. The company was registered in April 2014 as Haxi Ltd in London, Great Britain. Angel investor funding for Haxi was secured in June 2014. Since December 2013, Haxi grew into the biggest ridesharing network in Norway in 6 months. In June 2014, it was estimated that 11,000 Norwegians were using Haxi. By August 2014, that number has risen to 31,000 users with over 2,000 registered drivers in Norway alone. In September 2014, Haxi surpassed 3,000 registered drivers, and has 42,000 users, with 72% using the app more than once. At this growth rate, Haxi is expected to become bigger than the whole Norwegian taxi force combined by December 2014. Haxi is mentioned as one of the most interesting companies in the ridesharing market Worldwide. In June 2014, Norwegian Taxi Association CEO, Lars Hjelmeng, estimated that ridesharing via Haxi and social media is generating up to one billion NOK (Norwegian Krone) annually."

It operated for 58 years until it was sold in 1929 to a Drinkard and Emmert company, Horse Creek Land & Cattle Co. of Denver. The HOP Ranch was located in what is currently the northernmost portion of the present-day Chico Basin Ranch. The HOP Ranch was named for the three original partners – H for William T. Hurd, Superintendent of the Michigan Central Railroad stockyards in Detroit; O for William HOlmes of Wayland, Massachusetts, a six-year veteran merchant seaman and mate who had sailed aboard clipper ships throughout the world; and P for Samuel A.

This also means that other users might access the internet through one's own computer, and that part of one's upload bandwidth might be used for serving cached data to other users. Paying users can choose to redirect all requests to peers but are themselves never used as peers."

On 1 December 1997, Helix Software merged with McAfee, Network General, and PGP Corporation in a pooling of interest transaction, the resulting company was named Network Associates. Helix's products were integrated with the other companies' products as well as with products from the subsequent acquisitions of Cybermedia and Dr Solomon's Antivirus. The combined products were branded McAfee Office and McAfee Security Suite."

  "text" : "Hanningtons was a department store located in Brighton, part of the English coastal city of Brighton and Hove. Prominently situated in a central position in Brighton, it had an unbroken history of trading for nearly 200 years until its closure in 2001. It was the city's oldest, largest and most diverse department store: its 70 departments offered clothes and household goods of all types, and services ranging from funeral arrangement to carpet-cleaning. \"Famous\" and \"prestigious\", it was known locally as the \"Harrods of Brighton\". It remained in family ownership until the 1960s, and subsequent owners ran the business according to the principles of the Hannington family. Hanningtons grew from a single shop on the town's North Street into a large store spanning numerous shop units on that road and neighbouring streets. Some services were housed in other buildings elsewhere in Brighton and Hove. Regular expansion meant many changes to the main building, but its overall architectural style dates from the 1860s when architect William Russell unified the shop units owned by Hanningtons at that time into a common style. Part of the former store—the section at numbers 41 and 42 East Street, acquired in 1882—is listed at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance."

  "text" : "Homeopathy Plus! is an Australian company run by homeopath Fran Sheffield in Tuggerah, New South Wales. It is known for the claim that homeopathy is an effective, and safer, alternative to vaccination for conditions including whooping cough, along with claims that homeopathy is superior to chemotherapy for cancer. The claims for \"homeoprophylaxis\" were assessed as misleading by the Complaints Resolution Panel of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and a retraction demanded; this was ignored. The prophylaxis claims were referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), and although this was stated to have resulted in their removal, legal proceedings continued, culminating in a ruling by Justice Perry of the Federal Court of Australia in December 2014 that: 2) The First Respondent and the Second Respondent have in trade or commerce:a) engaged in conduct that was misleading and deceptive or was likely to mislead and deceive, in contravention of section 18 of the ACL;b) in connection with the supply or possible supply of Homeopathic Treatments, and in connection with the promotion of the supply of Homeopathic Treatments, made false or misleading representations that the Homeopathic Treatments are of a particular standard or quality in contravention of section 29(1)(a) and (b) of the ACL; andc) in connection with the supply or possible supply of Homeopathic Treatments, and in connection with the promotion of the supply of Homeopathic Treatments, made false or misleading representations that Homeopathic Treatments have a use or benefit in contravention of section 29(1)(g) of the ACL. The Federal judge concluded that: \"there is no reasonable basis, in the sense of an adequate foundation, in medical science to enable the First Respondent and the Second Respondent to state that HomeopathicTreatments are safe and effective as an alternative to the Vaccine for the Prevention of Whooping Cough\". Sheffield was also the originator of a controversial change.org petition to the World Health Organisation calling on the WHO to use homeopathy in the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa; a New Zealand MP who signed the petition was demoted from his position as a result. The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key called the idea of homeopathy for Ebola \"barking mad\". The sentence was announced on October 14, 2015: Fran Sheffield was fined $23,000 and banned from selling the products for five years, and Homeopathy Plus fined $115,000."

  "text" : "Hummel Aviation is an American aircraft manufacturer based in Bryan, Ohio and founded by James Morris (Morry) Hummel in 1983. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of ultralight aircraft in the form of plans and kits for amateur construction. The company was formed in 1983 to produce Hummel's initial Hummel Bird design. The plane was named by Jack Cox in a Sport Aviation magazine article reviewing the design. On 9 July 1995 Hummel was involved in an aircraft accident when a bolt broke in the aileron control system of the Mini-MAX he was flying. Hummel was seriously injured and designed the Hummel UltraCruiser shortly thereafter as a consequence of a religious revelation he had during his recovery. The UltraCruiser prototype was started in 1999 and was completed in June 2000. In April 2002 a new version of the UltraCruiser was designed for larger pilots, the Hummel UltraCruiser Plus. Another derivative model for larger pilots, the Hummel H5, was the most recent addition to the company's line."
