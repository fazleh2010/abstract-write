  "text" : "Kangol is a British clothing company famous for its headwear. Founded in the 1920s, by Jewish Polish World War I veteran Jacques Spreiregen, Kangol (the K from knitting, the ANG from angora, and the OL from wool) produced hats for workers, golfers, and especially soldiers. In 1938, Spreiregen, who was working in London as an importer, opened a factory at Cleator, Cumbria, England which he ran with his nephew Joseph Meisner. A second factory was opened at nearby Frizington, and later, under the direction of Spreiregen's younger nephew Sylvain Meisner, a third factory, manufacturing motorcycle helmets and seat belts in Carlisle. They were the major beret suppliers to the armed forces during World War II, including famously Field Marshal Montgomery. During and after the war, Kangol berets were the height of fashion. In the 1960s, designers Mary Quant and Pierre Cardin worked with the company, whose products graced the heads of the rich and famous, including the Beatles and Arnold Palmer, and later Diana, Princess of Wales. The company also supplied uniformed organizations such as the Scout Association. In the 1980s Kangol berets entered a new phase of fashion history with their adoption by members of the hip-hop community, such as Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Kangol Kid of UTFO, and The Notorious B.I.G. The brand was popularized even more by the 1991 movie New Jack City. The release of more consciously stylish products in the 1990s such as the furgora (angora-wool mix) Spitfire, was helped by its presence upon the head of Samuel L. Jackson in 1997. Kevin Eubanks, bandleader for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, sported a Kangol beret on an almost nightly basis. In 2009, Eminem wore the Cotton Twill Army Cap Kangol hat on his Beautiful video. Kangol has been owned by Sports Direct since 2006, when they acquired the brand from private equity fund August Equity Trust. Licences to manufacture and sell Kangol apparel have been sold to many different companies including D2 and Topshop. The global rights to Kangol hats have been held by American hatmakers Bollman Hat Company since 2002. It was announced in February 2009 that Bollman were reviewing their worldwide operations, putting 33 jobs and the future of the Kangol head office in Cleator in doubt. On 6 April 2009, it was announced that the original factory would be converted to a warehouse with the loss of 25 jobs. Only seven employees now remain employed at the company's original site and the outlet shop will close at the end of August 2009. However, hats will continue to be made at their sites in Eastern Europe and the United States."

It was founded as Wood River Oil and Refining Company in 1940, and later as Rock Island Oil & Refining Company. Koch also owns Invista, Georgia-Pacific, Molex, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Pipeline, Koch Fertilizer, Koch Minerals, and Matador Cattle Company. Koch companies are involved in industries such as the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of petroleum, chemicals, energy, fiber, intermediates and polymers, minerals, fertilizers, pulp and paper, chemical technology equipment, ranching, finance, commodities trading, and other ventures and investments. The firm employs about 60,000 people in the United States and another 40,000 in 59 other countries. In 2013-2015, Forbes listed it as the second largest privately held company in the United States (after Cargill), with an annual revenue of $115 billion, down from the largest in 2006. If Koch Industries were a public company in 2013, it would have ranked 17 in the Fortune 500. Fred C. Koch, after whom Koch Industries, Inc. is named, co-founded the company in 1940 and developed an innovative crude oil refining process. His sons, Charles Koch, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and David Koch, executive vice president, are principal owners of the company after they bought out their brothers, Frederick and William \"Bill\" Koch, for $1.1 billion in 1983. Charles and David Koch each own 42% of Koch Industries. Charles has stated that the company would go public \"over my dead body\"."

  "text" : "Kmart (sometimes stylized as K mart or kmart) is a chain of big box department stores headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States. The chain purchased Sears for $11 billion in 2005, forming a new corporation under the name Sears Holdings Corporation. The company was founded in 1962 and is the third largest big box chain in North America, behind Walmart and Target, with stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam (which houses the world's largest Kmart). It also used to operate stores in Canada, Mexico, and Eastern Europe. As of January 30, 2016, the company operated a total of 941 Kmart stores in 49 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including 934 discount stores, averaging 95,000 sq ft (8,800 m2), and a Super Center, averaging 170,000 sq ft (16,000 m2). Kmart became known for its \"Blue Light Specials\": they occurred at surprise moments when a store worker would light up a mobile police light and offer a discount in a specific department of the store, while announcing the discounted special over the store's public address system. At the height of Kmart's popularity, the phrase \"Attention Kmart shoppers!\" entered into the American pop psyche, appearing in films and other media such as Troop Beverly Hills, Six Days Seven Nights, Rain Man, Beetlejuice, Madea Goes to Jail and Dawn of the Dead. Kmart's world headquarters was located in Troy, Michigan, in Metro Detroit, but since the purchase of Sears, it has been relocated to Hoffman Estates, Illinois in the Chicagoland area. Kmart also exists in Australia and New Zealand (see Kmart Australia), although it now has no relation to the American stores except in name, after U.S. equity in the Australian business was purchased in the late 1970s."

KTM was split into four companies, all of which shared the same \"KTM\" branding, and in present have many more subsidiaries with the same branding. However, KTM-Sportmotorcycle is most commonly associated with the KTM brand, because it still continues the flagship business of its parent company. KTM is known for its two-stroke and four-stroke off-road motorcycles though in recent years it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars."

K. Kyodo News is Kyodo News' business arm, established in 1972. The subdivision Kyodo News International, founded in 1982, provides over 200 reports to international news media and is located in Rockefeller Center, New York City. Their online news site is in Japanese, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Korean, and English. The agency employs over 1,000 journalists and photographers, and maintains news exchange agreements with over 70 international media outlets. Satoshi Ishikawa is the news agency's president. Kyodo News was formed by Furunu Inosuke, the president of the Domei News Agency, following the dissolution of Domei after World War II. Kyodo News is the only remaining news agency to transmit news via radiofax. It broadcasts complete newspapers in Japanese and English, often at 60 lines per minute instead of the more normal 120 because of the greater complexity of written Japanese. A full day's news takes hours to transmit. Kyodo has a dedicated transmission to Pacific fishing fleets from Kagoshima Prefectural Fishery Radio, and a relay from 9VF, possibly still in Singapore. The frequencies formerly used by JJC radio outside Tokyo are now sent from an unknown location, using the same identification in Japanese as 9VF. They are still active and heard daily in 2015."

  "text" : "Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace AS (KDA), one of two operating companies of Kongsberg Gruppen (KOG) of Norway, is a supplier of defence and space related systems and products, mainly anti-ship missiles, military communications, and command and weapons control systems for naval vessels and air-defence applications. Today, the company is probably best known abroad for its development/industrialisation and production of the first passive IR homing anti-ship missile of the western world, the Penguin, starting delivery in the early 1970s (when KDA was part of KOG's predecessor Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk). The latest product which attracts huge interest is the PROTECTOR Remote Weapon Station which is fielded by the US Army (main armament of the Stryker ICV Vehicle), the Canadian Army and the Australian Army. As of 2005, Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace had 1,421 employees. Space related activities are conducted within KDA itself in addition to its subsidiaries, Kongsberg Spacetec (wholly owned) and Kongsberg Satellite Services (50% owned by KDA, 50% by the Norwegian Space Centre), both located in Tromsø. Notable space related products from KDA are the Booster Attachment and Release Mechanisms for ESA's Ariane 5. In the early 1990s KDA was involved with NASA's JPL and Germany's DASA in software development of the test/checkout system, as well as spacecraft hardware production, for the NASA/ESA Cassini-Huygens space probe. KDA has also delivered the Solar Array Drive Mechanism for ESA's Rosetta space probe. On 22 November 2008 Norwegian Minister of Defence Anne-Grete Strøm-Erichsen opened a new KDA plant that will produce parts for the aircraft recently chosen as Norway's future fighter, the F-35 Lightning II. In October 2010, Kongsberg signed an agreement with Rheinmetall on joint development of remote weapons systems."

In 1956, Kaman began to diversify as an aerospace subcontractor of McDonnell Douglas, Grumman and others. In the mid-1960s Kaman diversified outside of the aerospace industry, using the expertise Kaman had gained in composite materials and the end of the need for skilled woodworkers to craft wooden rotor blades. Charles Kaman, a guitarist as well as an aerospace pioneer, worked with his engineers and other musicians to create the round-backed, composite-body Ovation guitar, which revolutionized the guitar industry and led to the eventual creation of Kaman Music (now KMCMusicorp). Kaman Music was an independent distributor of musical instruments and accessories, and a major producer of guitars and guitar parts and accessories."

Kissel manufactured trucks of 3/4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tons, and maintained a sales office at 2515 Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois in early 1913. In 1915 the company (542 Kissel Ave.) advertised in the National Lumberman the new models that included a 1000 lb. and 6 ton replaced the 5 ton. During World War I the company produced trucks for the US military as well as the allies. In June 1915 Kissel shipped 30 ambulances and 50 heavy service trucks to the Kingdom of Serbia. By 1918 Kissel was producing the Standard B \"Liberty\" Truck for the military. Kissel prospered after the war but with stiff competition and the Great Depression, mounting losses, and an attempted hostile take-over by New Era Motors' president Archie Andrews forced Kissel to file for receivership protection in November, 1930."

  "text" : "Kansas City Southern is the parent company of the Kansas City Southern Railway, a Class I railroad headquartered in the Quality Hill neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, USA. It is also sometimes known as \"The NAFTA Railroad\" in reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement because its operations carry goods between the Midwestern United States and Mexico. Kansas City Southern was founded in 1887 by Arthur Edward Stilwell, with the goal of connecting the U.S. heartland to the Gulf of Mexico. An early slogan for the company was \"The shortest route from Kansas City to salt water.\" Its original network linked Kansas City with Port Arthur, Texas. Although it remained financially strong, it did not add routes until the 1930s, when it expanded to Louisiana. From 1940 to 1969, KCS offered luxury passenger service between Kansas City and New Orleans, but ceased passenger operations due to the growing popularity of auto and air travel. KCS' next large expansion did not take place until 1993, when it purchased the MidSouth Railroad, which provided its first east-west route, connecting Dallas, Texas to Meridian, Mississippi. Due to KCS' geographic placement, the railroad has benefited from the passage of NAFTA in 1995. KCS attempted to purchase the Southern Pacific Transportation Company from Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad Company in 1988, but was defeated by the Rio Grande's parent company, Rio Grande Industries. KCS is also part owner of the Panama Canal Railway Company, which operates the Panama Canal Railway."

Kaiser and physician Sidney Garfield. Kaiser Permanente is made up of three distinct but interdependent groups of entities: the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (KFHP) and its regional operating subsidiaries; Kaiser Foundation Hospitals; and the regional Permanente Medical Groups. As of 2014, Kaiser Permanente operates in eight states and the District of Columbia, and is the largest managed care organization in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, Kaiser Permanente had 10.2 million health plan members, 186,497 employees, 18,652 physicians, 51,010 nurses, 38 medical centers, and 622 medical offices. As of Dec. 31, 2015, the non-profit Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals entities reported a combined $1.9 billion in net income on $60.7 billion in operating revenues. Each Permanente Medical Group operates as a separate for-profit partnership or professional corporation in its individual territory, and while none publicly reports its financial results, each is primarily funded by reimbursements from its respective regional Kaiser Foundation Health Plan entity. KFHP is one of the largest not for profit organizations in the United States. KP's quality of care has been highly rated and attributed to a strong emphasis on preventive care, its doctors being salaried rather than paid per service, and an attempt to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay. However, Kaiser has had disputes with its employee's unions, faced civil and criminal charges for patient dumping, faced action by regulators over the quality of care it provided, especially to patients with mental health issues, and has faced criticism from activists and action from regulators over the size of its cash reserves."

  "text" : "Kalashnikov Concern (Izhevsk Machinebuilding Plant until 2013; Russian: Ижевский машиностроительный Завод) or IZHMASH (ИЖМАШ) is the largest arms manufacturer in Russia headquartered in both Izhevsk (Udmurtia, Russia) and Moscow that produces a wide range civilian and military weapons including assault and sniper rifles, guided artillery projectiles and a wide range of other precision weapons. The majority of civilian products includes hunting shotguns, sporting rifles, various machines and tools. The Concern produces about 95% of all small arms in Russia and supplying to more than 27 countries around the world. The Concern contains three brands: \"Kalashnikov\" (combat and civilian weapons)\", \"Baikal\" (hunting and civilian guns), and \"Izhmash\" (sporting rifles). The Concern is developing new business lines that include remote weapon stations, unmanned aerial vehicles and multi-functional special-purpose boats. In May 2014 a deal to transfer 49% of the company’s shares to private investors (Andrey Bokarev and Alexey Krivoruchko) was completed, a majority – 51% – remained within the state-owned corporation Rostec. At the same time, by agreement of shareholders, the control over the management of the Concern always stays with the private shareholders. Therefore, although the state has remained a controlling stake owner, the management structure of Kalashnikov today is of a private company."

It is part of the Fuyo Group and has its headquarters in Minato, Tokyo. The company changed its English name from Keihin Electric Express Railway Co., Ltd. to Keikyu Corporation on 21 October 2010. Trains on the Main Line have a maximum operating speed of 120 kilometres per hour (75 mph), making it the third fastest private railroad in the Tokyo region, after the Keisei Skyliner and the Tsukuba Express.

  "text" : "Key is a Japanese visual novel studio which formed on July 21, 1998 as a brand under the publisher VisualArt's and is located in Kita, Osaka, Japan. Key released their debut visual novel Kanon in June 1999, which combined an elaborate storyline, an up-to-date anime-style drawing style, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key's second game Air released in September 2000 had a similar if not more complex storyline to Kanon and a more thorough gameplay. Both Kanon and Air were originally produced as adult games, but Key broke this trend with their third title Clannad which was released in April 2004 for all ages. Key has worked in the past with Interchannel and Prototype for the consumer port releases of the brand's games. Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats! (2010) and Charlotte (2015). The brand's ninth game Rewrite was released in June 2011, and a fan disc for the game titled Rewrite Harvest festa! was released in July 2012. The first volume in the six-part Angel Beats! episodic visual novel was released in June 2015. Key released the kinetic novel Harmonia in September 2016. Co-founder Jun Maeda is a prominent figure in the brand, having contributed to the planning, scenario, and music composition in the majority of Key's visual novels. Na-Ga, Key's main artist, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but with Key's sixth game Little Busters! was given the position of co-art director with former Key artist Itaru Hinoue. Shinji Orito, Key's main composer and another co-founder, has composed music for the majority of Key's titles. Yūto Tonokawa, a scenario writer, first worked on the scenario in Little Busters!. Key has been an active participant at the Comiket convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999, where they sold Kanon-related products; Key's latest appearance at Comiket was at Comiket 89 in December 2015. In 2001, VisualArt's created the record label Key Sounds Label to release music albums and singles with music related to Key's visual novels. Between December 2007 and August 2010, Key produced an Internet radio show called Key Net Radio in regard to the brand."

The company was founded in 1985 and registered in Kotka. In addition to the five destinations in the early days of business they currently sail to more than 70 ports. Summer destinations traditionally include several ports of the Baltic Sea, Norwegian fjords and other cities in Northern Europe. In the autumn the ship usually sails in the Mediterranean, where one week cruises to many different destinations are arranged. During winter seasons their ships have sailed in Canary Islands and east coast of Africa. They used to operate two ships, Kristina Regina (1960) made foreign cruises, often cruising in the Mediterranean Sea and other warm destinations. The second ship, Kristina Brahe (1943) was used for cruises within the lakes and coast of Finland. These ships begun to show their age and did not meet the new regulations and have now been sold. MS Kristina Katarina, originally built in 1982 as M/S Konstantin Simonov, was the latest ship. In 2013 the company faced financial difficulties forcing Kristina Cruises to lay up its 1982-built Katarina cruise ship for the winter and cancel the season, the company today has sold the vessel to FleetProOcean. All 2014 plans are cancelled and the company is said to be concentrating on selling cruises on other ships as a tour operator."

Kelsey's has a licensing agreement through early 2011 with CBS Consumer Products for the rights to the theme song from the 1980s sitcom Cheers, which the chain says could lead to \"other opportunities\" in the future. Kelsey's also uses the show's title in its slogan \"Cheers to good friends\", although (due to the generic nature of the word \"cheers\" in regards to pubs and the like) it is not clear whether permission from CBS was required for this."

Its headquarters are in San Francisco, California. All its properties are located in the United States. Most Kimpton properties are marketed under their own independent names as boutique hotels; however, in 2005, the company launched two sub-brands within the company's brand: Hotel Palomar and Hotel Monaco. Each hotel has a restaurant or bar that is marketed as upscale or trendy. The company's loyalty program is called Karma Rewards. Fortune listed it as the #11 best company to work for in 2015. Under contract, the company also manages and operates hotels owned by other entities. December 16, 2014, IHG announced it would acquire Kimpton for $430 million in cash. IHG has retained the Kimpton brand name within the U.S. and may expand it globally. As a result of the acquisition, seven of Kimpton's nine hotels in San Francisco departed the brand in July 2015."

  "text" : "Kino International is a film and video distributor, founded by Bill Pence in 1977. Donald Krim bought Kino just months after its founding and served as president of the company until his death from cancer in 2011. Kino, based in New York City, specializes in art house films, such as low-budget current films, classic films from earlier periods in the history of cinema, and world cinema. Similar in many respects to The Criterion Collection, the home video releases by Kino are usually restored versions with substantial supplementary material. Kino's theatrical arm handles theatrical distribution of much of the Janus Collection, and has a focus on recent art house and foreign films. Their non-theatrical arm has more of a focus on classic cinema, providing silent film classics which are otherwise difficult to find. They are the largest video distributor of silent films, including a great many from the early days of cinema (before 1914). These include important early landmark films by Thomas Edison, Georges Méliès, the Lumière brothers and D.W. Griffith. Many of those were restored by David Shepard's Film Preservation Associates. In 2009, Kino International merged with Lorber HT Digital to form Kino Lorber.

  "text" : "Kuhn, Loeb & Co. was a bulge bracket investment bank founded in 1867 by Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb. Under the leadership of Jacob H. Schiff, it grew to be one of the most influential investment banks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financing America's expanding railways and growth companies, including Western Union and Westinghouse, and thereby becoming the principal rival of J.P. Morgan & Co. In the years following Schiff's death in 1920, the firm was led by Otto Kahn and Felix Warburg, men who had already solidified their roles as Schiff's able successors. However, the firm's fortunes began to fade following World War II, when it failed to keep pace with a rapidly changing investment banking industry, where Kuhn, Loeb's old-world, genteel ways, did not seem to fit; the days of the gentleman-banker had passed. Considered one of the last gentlemen investment banks, the firm lost its independence in 1977 when it merged with Lehman Brothers, creating Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. The combined firm was itself acquired in 1984 by American Express, forming Shearson Lehman/American Express and with that, the Kuhn, Loeb name was lost."

The camp tends to draw campers from Toronto, although it has been known to have campers attend from around the world. Kilcoo Camp offers many activities such as: swimming, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, windsurfing, cliff diving, woodcraft, archery, arts and crafts, mountain biking, rock climbing, and many others. Kilcoo also has the facilities for basketball, ball hockey, baseball, soccer, football, and other sports. In addition to regular programing, a number of special, camp-wide events take place each month. Each Sunday is characterized by a non-denominational Chapel service, carried out on the historic and memorable Chapel Point. Each month is highlighted by its own campwide event: The Bushpede in July and the Kilcoo Olympic Games in August. Kilcoo also maintains an out-tripping program, sending groups to local destinations in Ontario and Quebec as well as more remote locations, like the Nahanni River in the Northwest Territories and Strathcona Park, Vancouver Island. Kilcoo maintains strong contact with its alumni: a good number of new campers are sons or grandsons of past Kilcoo campers. There are several reunion events, which afford the opportunity for past staff and campers to reconnoiter. Amici, a charitable organization that endeavors to send children to summer camp, was founded and continues to be run in majority by Kilcoo alumni. The camp is divided into five sections based on age. From youngest to oldest these are Trailblazers, Pathfinders, Nor Westers, Trappers and Voyageurs."

  "text" : "Kwik Save is a British discount supermarket chain, originally founded in Wales, with stores across the United Kingdom. It went into administration in 2007, but was brought back in April 2012. Its stores were small to medium-sized high street supermarkets, mainly located in areas with below average incomes. It struggled to make profits during the 2000s, as superstore operators such as Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's introduced their own budget brands, and foreign discounters such as Lidl, Aldi and Netto (whom all arrived in the United Kingdom during the first half of the 1990s) expanded. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but it went into administration on 6 July 2007, and closed most of its stores across the United Kingdom, with the remaining 56 being sold to a new company, FreshXpress, which itself went into administration in March 2008. It was then resurrected in a smaller form with nine stores, but this second incarnation of FreshXpress went into administration, and ceased trading in 2009. All remaining stores have since been closed. In April 2012, Kwik Save returned, and is now owned by convenience store operator Costcutter. The first new store opened in Little Lever, Bolton, and the company is continuing to expand."

  "text" : "Ataute, S.L., better known by their trading name Kukuxumusu, is a Spanish company from Pamplona, Navarra specialising in clothing and product design. Its name means flea kiss in Basque. The company was founded in 1989 Pamplona's San Fermín festival. Three friends made souvenir T-shirts depicting the bull-running and bull fights. The company gradually grew and is now one of the key images of San Fermín; in addition to clothing they also produce other goods such as chinaware, keyrings and postcards. Kukuxumusu has exclusive shops in Pamplona and all the main cities within the Basque Country and also in the rest of Spain. Moreover its products are sold elsewhere in over sixty countries. Kukuxumusu's designs are distinctive for their style and humour. Their most famous designs involve bulls and the San Fermín runners in their traditional red and white clothing, but adding some absurd elements. Bulls may be seen chasing the runners over the sea on surfboards, or apparently uninterested in the San Fermín activities. In some designs, the roles of humans and bulls are reversed. Other designs often involve animals, devils or Basque symbols such as the lauburu in humorous situations. Kukuxumusu's designs have grown to include other Spanish regions festivals and typical elements and have, therefore, become a popular souvenir in Spain. Kukuxumusu has added computer screensavers and virtual postcards, with their usual unique humour to their line of clothing and souvenirs."

  "text" : "Key Tronic (NASDAQ: KTCC) is a contract manufacturer. Founded in 1969, its core product group initially included keyboards, mice and other input devices. KeyTronic now specializes in PCBA and full product assembly, plastic molding, precision metal stamping, fabrication and finishing, and engineering services with products ranging from simple consumer devices to complex, high end commercial and industrial electro-mechanical products. Key Tronic operates worldwide with activities in the United States, Mexico, and China. After the introduction of the IBM PC, Key Tronic began manufacturing keyboards compatible with those computer system units. Most of their keyboards are based on the 8048 microcontroller to communicate to the computer. Their early keyboards used an Intel 8048 MCU. However, as the company evolved, they began to use their own 8048-based MCUs. In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other \"solid-state switch\" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-Effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards.

  "text" : "Kyivstar (Ukrainian: Київстар) is the largest mobile network operator in Ukraine, it had 25.4 million subscribers at the end of June 2014 and thus a 42 percent market share. It served 24,944,592 subscribers as of October 2010. Kyivstar's wireless network operates using the GSM standard and provides coverage accessible by approximately 99% of the Ukrainian population. On 5 February 2015 Kyivstar officially gave up its base stations in territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists during the War in Donbass. The following months the company accused the separatists Donetsk People's Republic of setting up its own mobile network operator using these base stations. On 18 April 2015 pro-Russian separatist leader Aleksandr Zakharchenko issued a decree stating that all equipment that Kyivstar gave up falls under the control of the separatists in order to “meet the needs of the population in the communication services”. Kyivstar's president Petro Chernyshov labelled the Donetsk People's Republic operator \"It's just robbery\"."

  "text" : "Kieft Cars, founded by Cyril Kieft, was a British car company that built Formula Three racing cars and some road going sports cars in a factory in Derry St, Wolverhampton. Cyril Kieft was born in Swansea and spent his early working life in the steel industry. After the second World war he started up his own company Cyril Kieft and Co Ltd in Bridgend, Glamorgan making forgings and pressings including components for the motor industry. He had an interest in motor racing and when the Marwyn company, who had built Formula Three cars, failed he bought the designs and used them as a base for his own 500cc car. Several of these were sold and some competition success resulted. Publicity was gained by successful attempts on a series of records at Autodrome de Montlhéry in France. One of the drivers was Stirling Moss who explained the shortcomings of the cars. As a result of this a new design was acquired, Moss and his manager Ken Gregory became directors, whilst the company moved to new premises at Reliance Works in Derry Street, Wolverhampton. A new design by Gordon Bedson, who had joined the company from the aircraft industry, was produced in time for the 1951 Whit Monday Meeting at Goodwood where it won the Formula Three event driven by Moss. Don Parker was employed as works driver and won the British Formula Three championships in 1952 and 1953. In 1954 Kieft started to make a two-seater sports car which could also be used as a road car. Using a Coventry Climax FWA engine, all independent suspension using transverse leaf springs at the rear and a lightweight glass fibre body the car was really a racing car and at £1560 it is doubtful if any were bought just as road cars. The company was losing money and at the end of 1954 Kieft sold the company to racing driver Berwyn Baxter. Kieft Cars left Wolverhampton in 1956 and moved to nearby Birmingham where they concentrated on preparing and tuning other makes of cars. There were plans for a return to making Kieft cars but these failed to materialise. The company was sold again in 1960 and changed its name to Burmans. Kieft Sports Car Co. Ltd. is now owned by Canadian Peter Schömer and based out of Chichester, West Sussex near Goodwood. There is a new Sports Racer in the works using a Coventry Climax FPF 2.5 liter twin cam engine called the Kieft-Climax.Kieft logo TM# 2516876 property of the Kieft Sports Car Co.Ltd."

  "text" : "K&W Cafeterias Inc. is a Southern USA chain of cafeteria-style restaurants. Its headquarters are in the K&W Corporate Office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. K&W serves traditional Southern favorites including fried chicken, turnip greens, fried okra, and homemade desserts. Grady T. Allred, Sr., a founder of K&W Cafeterias, entered the restaurant business on Thanksgiving Day 1935 as an employee of a small restaurant on Cherry Street in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Carolinian Coffee Shop was owned by brothers Thomas, Kenneth and William Wilson and their brother-in-law T.K. Knight. In 1937, the initials K&W (for Knight and Wilson) were adopted and K&W Restaurant was established. Allred later acquired a one-third interest in the K&W Restaurant. After operating the restaurant with his partners for a few years, Allred purchased their interests and became the sole owner of K&W Restaurant around the year 1941. The K&W Restaurant continued to flourish at the Winston-Salem Cherry Street location until fire damage forced it to close for several months. After repairs and restoration were completed, it reopened as a restaurant/cafeteria combination. The cafeteria concept of the operation became so popular and successful that Allred decided to convert the unit entirely to cafeteria style food service. K&W occupied its original location in Winston-Salem until an urban renewal project forced a move to 720 Coliseum Drive in Winston-Salem. On January 18, 1988, the K&W located at 380 Knollwood Street in Winston-Salem exploded due to a natural gas leak. The restaurant was destroyed and the attached Sheraton hotel was severely damaged. The blast occurred while the restaurant was closed. Of the four persons in the lobby/cafeteria building at the time of the explosion, three sustained minor injuries. A fourth person sustained a fractured ankle. Both the restaurant and the hotel were damaged beyond repair and were subsequently demolished. In 1991, K&W began offering takeout service through the To Go Shop. In 2009, K&W Catering began, for events such as weddings and corporate meetings. While other cafeteria chains went bankrupt during the 1980s and 1990s, K&W continued to prosper. From the original restaurant establishment, which seated 110 people, K&W has expanded to 35 cafeterias and over 2500 employees throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and formerly Maryland. Grady Allred, Sr. died in 1983. The chain continues to be operated by his family."

After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in 1996. The company's 2009 merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won ($20 billion) in assets. In January 2011, KT launched unified brand \"Olleh\" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services. In late 2015 former KT president Suk-Jae Lee was charged of breach of trust and embezzlement, allegations which he denies."

With a close inner circle of developers active in installations and global field service, Komori has used over the years Windows-based systems for press console functions. The mix of their own developments with third party products requires little or no integration process at the installation site—a true \"plug and play\" design."

The merger agreement with Lam Research was officially terminated on 5th Oct 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) concluded that the semiconductor industry will be better served by having KLA-Tencor remain as an independent company."

  "text" : "K2 Corporation was founded in 1962 by brothers Bill and Don Kirschner on Vashon Island, near Seattle, Washington in the United States. K2 is known for pioneering fiberglass ski technology, which made skis significantly lighter and more lively than their wood and metal contemporaries. Famous users of K2 skis include Seth Morrison, pro champion Spider Sabich, World Cup and Olympic champion Phil Mahre, and his twin brother Steve Mahre, World Champion and Olympic silver medalist. In late 1969, the company's rapid growth required new capital and Bill Kirschner decided a well-financed partner was necessary. The company was acquired by the Cummins Engine Company of Columbus, Indiana. Then in November 1976, the company was acquired by a private group of Northwest investors. The group, called Sitca, purchased K2 and its subsidiary, Jansport. In 1982, company management purchased all outstanding shares of Sitca Corporation from the group of Northwest investors. Management decided to concentrate all resources on the alpine ski market. It sold its Jansport subsidiary, distribution subsidiaries in Canada, France and Austria, and majority ownership of the Swiss distribution subsidiary In September 1985, Anthony Industries, Inc. acquired 100 percent of the stock of Sitca Corporation. Anthony, an NYSE listed company, develops and manufactures products for leisure and recreational markets under many brand names. In 1995, Anthony Industries sold off its Anthony Pools division to its rival, Sylvan Pools, and changed its name to K2, Inc. By 2000, board member Richard Heckmann had assumed control and embarked on a vigorous growth program. In order to remain financially competitive, in 2001 K2 moved its manufacturing from Vashon Island to Guangzhou Province, China, and its offices to Seattle. On June 22, 2006, K2 announced it was moving its business office from Vashon Island to Seattle's Industrial District. On April 25, 2007 Jarden Corporation announced a definitive agreement to acquire K2, Inc. for a cash and stock value per share of $15.50. Jarden is controlled by Martin Franklin, a British investor and triathlete. It is now owned by Newell Brands"

The company is based in Slough, Berkshire, England. The company was founded in 1853 as Kenyon & Son as a producer of confectionery, jam and pickles. By 1891 the company had become Kenyon & Son and Craven Limited. The company switched to producing roasted and salted hazelnuts in 1948, expanding to peanuts later. These were originally produced for sale in cinemas. In 1952 the company introduced Hercules Nuts and in 1953 the No.1 KP Nuts peanut brand. The company became part of United Biscuits (UB) in 1968. The KP Snacks subsidiary produces a range of packet snack brands including Hula Hoops, Skips, McCoy's, Frisps, Brannigan's, Royster's, Space Raiders, Discos, and Phileas Fogg. The snacks part is based on Teesside and in Rotherham, near the UB distribution warehouse. The Ashby-de-la-Zouch site won a \"Best Factory Award\" in 2004. UB sold the company to the German company Intersnack in December 2012 for £500 million."

  "text" : "Koninklijke Hoogovens known as Koninklijke Nederlandsche Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken (KNHS) until 1996 or informally Hoogovens. was a Dutch steel producer founded in 1918. The IJmuiden steelworks based in IJmuiden, the Netherlands was built between 1920 and 1940, first producing iron, later steel, with hot and cold rolling producing flat products. In the 1960s the company diversified into Aluminium production. The company briefly merged its IJmuiden steel plant with German steel company Hoesch from 1972 forming the joint venture Estel but demerged in 1982. In 1999, the company merged with the larger British Steel plc to create the Corus Group steel company. The aluminium production assets were sold off during the Corus period. In 2007, Corus Group was purchased by India-based Tata Steel and was renamed Tata Steel Europe in 2010."

  "text" : "Koa Coffee Plantation is a former grower and processor of Kona coffee on Hawaiʻi island, United States, acquired by Paradise Beverages DBA Hawaii Coffee Company in 2009. Koa Coffee Plantation is roasted in Honolulu by Hawaii Coffee Company. Koa Coffee Plantation's place of business is 1555 Kalani Street, Honolulu, HI. The company was established on the western slopes of Mauna Loa in Captain Cook, Hawaii by Marin Artukovich in 1997, at 19°29′33″N 155°53′32″W﻿ / ﻿19.49250°N 155.89222°W.It began as a small backyard business only producing 38,000 pounds (17,000 kg) of coffee in its first year. Coffee production nearly doubled every year to reach 2010 production of over 700,000 pounds (320,000 kg). In 2007, Artukovich sold most of the assets of the company to Kona's Best Natural Coffee. KBNC does business as Koa Coffee Plantation. Since 2009 Koa Coffee Plantation has been owned by Hawaii Coffee Company in Honolulu. The Koa Coffee Plantation gained accolades in the late 1990s early 2000's when it had been producing and selling only hand picked 100% estate Kona coffee, including organic Kona coffee and a heritage blend (Grande Domaine Kona) harvested from trees dating back to 1918. The plantation used a wet mill facility from Colombia, a dry mill from Brazil and maintained temperature and humidity control in their former green bean storage facility in Captain Cook, Hawaii. Koa Plantation was named by Forbes as America's best coffee in 2001, won the Pacific Coast Coffee Association Coffee of the Year Award in 2004 and Gevalia Cup in 2002. The Koa Coffee Plantation is also a member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America, the Kona Coffee Council and the Hawaii Coffee Association."

  "text" : "Koho is a brand of ice hockey equipment that originated from Finland. Currently, Koho equipment is manufactured by The Hockey Company (parent company of CCM, now owned by Adidas). Koho is especially known for its goaltending equipment. The main endorsees, instrumental to marketing the brand in the late 1990s and early 2000s, included Patrick Roy, Félix Potvin, Jocelyn Thibault, Tommy Salo, Mathieu Garon, Jean-Sébastien Giguère and Roberto Luongo. Although Koho had the support of high-profile endorsees such as Jaromír Jágr, the player equipment lines were comparatively unsuccessful. The brand name is currently owned by MonkeySports, which operates GoalieMonkey.com and Hockeymonkey.com. They are the exclusive retailer of the brand. Beginning in the early 1990s, Koho offered a line of goaltending equipment called Evolution. It was designed with former NHL goalie Bob Suave who at the time, worked for Koho. Arturs Irbe of the San Jose Sharks was well known for wearing this line of gear for many years. Later versions of Koho goal equipment were designed by goalie equipment guru Michel Lefebvre, who started with the 530 series, which were based on the pad which was sold previously under the Lefebvre brand. Lefebrve, contracted now to develop pads to be sold exclusively through the Koho brand, designed the 560, 570, 580 and 590 series. Beginning with the 560 series, Koho pads were designed exclusively by Lefebvre, and the equipment line was designed for the butterfly style of play. The 590 was the last pad that Patrick Roy wore during the 2002–03 season. During the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, the original plan was to have Roberto Luongo premiere the Koho 600 pad. However, as a result of the unexpected purchase of The Hockey Company by Reebok, Luongo appeared in the World Cup wearing 590s. When The Hockey Company was purchased by Reebok, the Koho name was momentarily dropped and replaced by Reebok, with the intent of eventually phasing out the Koho name from its main product line. The Hockey Company did so previously with the Heaton brand, and would eventually do the same with the CCM goalie brand. Koho was then delegated to a price-point street hockey goalie equipment set, featuring the graphic of the 570. However, on Reebok's first goalie equipment lines, including the RBK Premier and RBK Premier 2, a small tag with the Koho by Lefebvre logo remained, as the names Koho and Lefebvre still had (and continue to have) residual market value. Initially, Rbk was used for the pro and intermediate pro lines of equipment, while Reebok was reserved for all other lines (senior, junior and youth). When Reebok discontinued the use of Rbk in 2008, the Rbk branding was dropped from the hockey equipment as well. When the NHL resumed play in the 2005–06 season following the lockout, only one goaltender, Maxime Ouellet of the Vancouver Canucks, was using Koho equipment. Because the Koho name had been dropped by The Hockey Company, which consequently had not paid the NHL the appropriate licensing fees, the Koho name was not permitted to appear in a game or in any league or team media or promotional materials. Nonetheless, the Koho name remained on Ouellet's pads, which was an oversight by the league. At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, Jonas Hiller of the Anaheim Ducks appeared in pre-season games in 580 leg pads, which were white and blue, matching the colors of his previous team, HC Davos. The Koho name had actually already been removed from Hiller's pads prior to the 2006 IIHF World Championships. By the start of the regular season, Hiller was wearing 580s in colors matching the Ducks' uniform colors. However, about halfway through the season, the logos were removed from his pads. In 2008, GoalieMonkey.com managed to bring back the Koho name to the retail market at least, producing a set with the name Koho 700. The set included pads, blocker, glove, chest protector and a composite goal stick. None of these products were actually designed by Lefebvre, however. They were a pad designed for the hybrid goaltender, but nevertheless feel very similar to the Lefebvre Koho lines, minus the traditional shin rolls, which were never a feature of Lefebvre's design. Meanwhile, Jonas Hiller began the 2008–09 season with 580s with no Koho logos. About halfway through the season, however, Hiller switched to a nearly identical pair of leg pads, this time featuring the Koho logos. This indicated that Monkey Sports, Inc. had successfully negotiated the licensing rights with the NHL, marking Koho's official return to the NHL. In 2009, rumors circulated that a new Koho pad, dubbed the \"900\" series, would be produced, in conjunction with Michel Lefebvre. At the start of the 2009–10 season, Hiller began play in his trademark 580s, along with a blocker and catching glove with custom Koho graphics, thus giving credence to earlier rumors of a new Koho pad. It was later revealed there was a new pad to match his blocker and catching glove but since Hiller had no time to break them in after receiving them after training camp, he stuck with his signature 580s. Hiller debuted the Koho 588 pad in the beginning of the 2010–11 season."

  "text" : "Kaiser Aluminum an American aluminum producer is a spinoff from Kaiser Aluminum and Chemicals Corporation which came to be when common stock was offered in Permanente Metals Corporation and Permanente Metals Corporation's name was changed to Kaiser Aluminum and Chemicals Corporation. Henry J. Kaiser's corporation entered the aluminum business by leasing, then purchasing three government-owned aluminum facilities in Washington state. These were the primary reduction plants at Mead and Tacoma, and the rolling mill at Trentwood. The company grew to be a vertically integrated aluminum producer. Kaiser currently owns 12 fabricating plants that can produce more than 400,000,000 pounds (180,000 long tons) of aluminum annually. The company also owns a 49 percent interest in an aluminum smelter in Wales. The North American plants produce approximately 500,000,000 pounds (220,000 long tons) per year of value-added sheet, plate, extrusions, forgings, rod, bar, and tube. Kaiser Aluminum is headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California. In 2005, it recorded revenues of roughly US$1.1 billion and employed more than 2,000 people at eleven fabricating facilities throughout North America. Kaiser Aluminum filed for bankruptcy in 2002 due to labor disputes, the West Coast energy crisis, and asbestos liabilities. It emerged from bankruptcy four years later. In March 2006, Kaiser Aluminum determined to restate its financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2005; June 30, 2005; and September 30, 2005, to adjust its VEBA-related payments and derivative financial instrument transactions."

  "text" : "KangaROOS are an American brand of sneaker originally produced from 1979 through the 1980s, with a later revival that continues in present. They were notable for having a small zippered pocket on the side of the shoe, large enough for a small amount of loose change, keys, etc. KangaROOS were designed by American architect and jogging enthusiast Bob Gamm. Gamm was a running enthusiast who would go ten kilometers a day, but preferred light athletic clothes without pockets. He designed the sneakers for his own personal use as a place to store his keys and money, then marketed them effectively. His marketing design was successful, leading to sales in excess of 700,000 pairs a month by the early 1980s. Further refinements on the original design led to several significant innovations in athletic footwear. One such innovation, the Dynacoil, was a patented energy release system designed in the mid-1980s by former Nike designer Ray Tonkel and consultant Al Gross and tested by NASA. Many other athletic shoe manufacturers would later incorporate similar designs into their shoes. In the early- to mid-1980s many USA professional athletes wore ROOS football and baseball shoes as well as shoes for running and training. Notables included Walter Payton, O.J. Anderson, William (the Fridge) Perry (football), Ozzie Smith, Vince Coleman and Ron Darling (baseball), and Kenyan track stars (running). There was a faddish dimension to the shoes, which became very popular among both casual athletes and American schoolchildren. Gamm himself remained committed to KangaROOS as serious athletic footwear, and in 1985 he worked with a 10,000-square-meter testing facility called the KangaROOS Laboratory & Gymnasium at the University of Illinois. This allowed for refinement and development of the sneakers for many different sports, including American football, basketball, hockey, tennis, and track and field. By the end of the 1980s, the popularity of the sneakers was on the decline, executives departed the company and KangaROOS were quietly withdrawn from the market. However, nostalgia, combined with an appreciation both of the shoe's athletic design and its ubiquitous pocket, led to a reappearance of the shoe in the late 1990s. Today, KangaROOS are sold in over sixty countries worldwide. Recent years have witnessed expansion through Central and South America as well as Asia. The footwear moved its strategic focus from performance sports to sports lifestyle footwear, most still bearing the zippered pocket on the side. Some, however, now have a side pouch up on the ankle, which can hold a small wallet."

  "text" : "Keurig /ˈkjʊərɪɡ/ is a beverage brewing system for home and commercial use. It is manufactured by the American company Keurig Green Mountain, which is headquartered in Waterbury, Vermont. The main Keurig products are: K-Cup pods, which are single-serve coffee containers; other beverage pods; and the proprietary machines that brew the beverages in these pods. Keurig beverage varieties include hot and cold coffees, teas, cocoas, dairy-based beverages, lemonades, cider, and fruit-based drinks. Through its own brands and its partnership licensed brands, Keurig has over 400 different varieties and over 60 brands of coffee and other beverages. In addition to K-Cup pods it includes Vue, Rivo, Bolt, K-Carafe, and K-Mug pods as well. The original single-serve brewer and coffee-pod manufacturing company, Keurig, Inc., was founded in Massachusetts in 1992. It launched its first brewers and K-Cup pods in 1998, targeting the office market. As the single-cup brewing system gained popularity, brewers for home use were added in 2004. In 2006 the publicly traded Vermont-based specialty-coffee company Green Mountain Coffee Roasters acquired Keurig, sparking rapid growth for both companies. In 2012 Keurig's main patent on its K-Cup pods expired, leading to new product launches, including brewer models that only accept pods from Keurig brands. Keurig has also entered the cold-beverage market with Brew Over Ice, and with Keurig Kold, which launched in September 2015; and it entered the soup market with a line of Campbell's Soup K-Cups which also launched in September 2015. From 2006 to 2014 Keurig, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. When Green Mountain Coffee Roasters changed its name to Keurig Green Mountain in March 2014, Keurig ceased to be a separate business unit and subsidiary, and instead became Keurig Green Mountain's main brand. In 2016 Keurig Green Mountain was acquired by an investor group led by private-equity firm JAB Holding Company for nearly $14 billion."

These include coffees that are certified organic, Fair Trade Certified, specialty blends, and flavored coffees and beverages. Begun as a small specialty coffee roaster and store in Vermont in 1981, after regional and national expansion in the late 1980s and an IPO in 1993, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters completed its acquisition of the brewing-machine manufacturer Keurig, Inc. in 2006, enabling rapid growth through the high-margin sales of its many varieties of single-serve K-Cup pods for home and office use. GMCR changed its name to Keurig Green Mountain in March 2014. The company is headquartered in Waterbury, Vermont. Its Canadian business unit subsidiary operates as Keurig Canada Inc. A publicly traded company from 1993 through 2015, in December 2015 the company announced that a group of investors led by JAB Holding Company would acquire Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion in cash. The acquisition closed in March 2016. Keurig Green Mountain is now a privately held company, and is an independent entity run by its pre-existing management team and a new CEO."

The company is one of the oldest model rc car makers in Japan, and produces a wide variety of products, including radio-controlled cars, planes, helicopters, and boats. Kyosho also produces highly detailed die-cast model cars. Its major competitor in the RC automobile market is Tamiya. Kyosho has avoided direct competition against Tamiya in the hobby grade RC cars market since the 80s and 90s, where Tamiya was most active, focusing instead on designing professional 1/8 scale racing buggies, Mini-Z series, and RC helicopters; areas in which Kyosho dominates today. The company is best known for the Inferno, its 1/8 scale competition buggies; Mini-Z series, and RC helicopters, but it also produces remote-controlled bipedal robots in the Manoi series."

Milk Moola is a Kwik Trip program that provides funding for schools, offering five cents per clipped pouch top. The program uses the catchphrase \"Moola for Your Schoola\". Kwik Trip also has an internal bakery operation which provides sliced and wrapped bread, doughnut and muffin products to its stores, along with a store brand snack line under the \"Urge\" branding."

Kathmandu is a leading retailer of clothing and equipment for travel and adventure in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. Kathmandu was founded by John Pawson and Jan Cameron in 1987 following their sale of the ALP Sports Clothing label. The company set up its first retail outlets in Australia whilst manufacturing most of its original clothing range in New Zealand. Bernard Wicht, owner of Alpine Accoutrements, had been the main manufacturer for ALP Sports but continued to manufacture for Kathmandu and also partnered with Penny Hazard to set up the Bivouac chain of stores in New Zealand. In 1992 Kathmandu, having established a strong operation in Australia (with stores in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra) re-entered the New Zealand retail marketplace, purchasing Alps Sports from its receivers and brought Bernard Wicht in as the third shareholder joining the two existing shareholders John Pawson and Jan Cameron. Kathmandu currently has 137 stores; 45 in New Zealand,87 in Australia and 5 in the United Kingdom as at the end of April 2013. The company was in 2006 fully acquired by an Australasian private equity company for NZ$275 million, after the reclusive founder had previously sold the other half of her business. Bernard was the owner of both the Fairydown and Macpac brands until 2015. Kathmandu was listed on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges in November, 2009."

This is down from a peak of 5.2 million tons reached in 1988. As domestic demand for bituminous coal has grown, exceeding 70 million tons in 2005, the company has reduced its Korean operations and begun to invest in overseas mines.

It was the successor to a Japanese government corporation set up under Japanese rule, when large-scale coal-mining in Korea began."

Kidrobot also makes Kidrobot Mascots, which are figures of their main logo. These figures are usually nicknamed KR (Kidrobot's common nickname) and the number of the Mascot. For example, the first Mascot was KR1. Some figures also have names; for example, KR1 was called Brooklyn. In August 2008, Kidrobot collaborated with jewelry designer, Tarina Tarantino, to launch a limited edition jewelry line, kidrobot by Tarina Tarantino. In November 2014, National Entertainment Collectibles Association Inc. (NECA) acquired Boulder-based art toy company Kidrobot. Terms were not disclosed. Artist-driven Kidrobot remains headquartered in Boulder, CO. Frank Kozik, the famed concert-poster artist and creator of Kid robot's Labbit vinyl toy products, joined the company as creative director in 2014. Kidrobot relocated to Boulder from New York in 2010. The company has since closed its retail stores in Boulder, New York, and Los Angeles. Paul Budnitz, who created the toys in his garage in 2002, no longer works at Kidrobot."

He gained experience managing Toddle House restaurants in Baton Rouge while obtaining an engineering degree at LSU. Soon they opened additional locations. The chain began offering franchise locations some years later and reached a peak of over 265 locations (combined total of company owned + franchisee owned restaurants). These were concentrated in the southern half of the US, from Florida west to New Mexico. The brothers sold the Houston-based chain and 119 locations (predominately located in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) to private equity investors Stephen Portis and Eric Porten in September 1995. This move took the company from a publicly registered company to a private one. Locations can usually be found near major highways and are open 24 hours a day.

  "text" : "Kansas City Power and Light Company is an electric utility company serving the Kansas City metropolitan area. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Incorporated of which it is the biggest component. The company traces its roots to November 1881 when Joseph S. Chick obtained the exclusive rights to use the Thompson-Houston arc lighting system in the counties of Jackson, Missouri, and Wyandotte, Kansas, for $4,000. The following month, the initial franchise to establish an electric works in the City of Kansas, Mo., was granted to Lysander R. Moore and later assigned to Kawsmouth Electric Light Company. Construction was begun in February 1882 on a power plant on a tract of land at the southeast corner of 8th and Santa Fe Streets in the West Bottoms. Kawsmouth Electric Light Company built quickly and, on Saturday night, May 13, 1882, brought electric illumination to the first 13 customers on the west side of Main Street in the downtown district. In 1885 the company reincorporated as Kansas City Electric Light Company. Weeks spun off the Edison Electric Light & Power Company to meet residential demand. An electric war ensued when in 1883 J. Ogden Armour, heir to the Armour Packing Company purchased the company on May 14, 1900, to power the Metropolitan Street Railway Company and Kansas City Electric Light Company. Under Armour the company bought competitors and built a new power plant in 1903, providing steam heat to downtown businesses. The company focused on the trolley company and in 1911 it went into receivership. In October 1917, the company spun off the trolley business (which still controlled some power plants) and emerged from bankruptcy as Kansas City Light & Power Company. In 1917 the company began construction on the Northeast Power station. In June 1919, the company reincorporated again, as Kansas City Power and Light Company. After acquiring the Carroll County Electric Company on July 29, 1922, the reorganized company became Kansas City Power & Light Company, adopting the ampersand and corporate name that continues to this day. Armour sold his interest in 1923. Continental Gas & Electric Corporation purchased the controlling interest in 1924 and was part of United Light and Power until United dissolved in 1950. The Hawthorn Station, situated on the Missouri River, was started in 1948, and the first of two units were completed in 1951. Two other units followed and were fully operational by 1956. Kansas City Power became independent in 1950. It acquired Eastern Kansas Utilities in 1952. It was part of a consortium that built Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas. In a 2001 corporate restructure it became part of Great Plains Energy Incorporated. In September 2009 KCP&L moved into its new building, One Kansas City Place at 1200 Main in KCMO, just 1 block west of Kansas City's Power and Light district. The lease is going to be 23 years long."

  "text" : "Krome Studios Pty Ltd. is an Australian video game company. Its headquarters were in Brisbane and it previously had offices in Adelaide and Melbourne. Krome Studios is best known for their Ty the Tasmanian Tiger games and for their reboot of the Spyro the Dragon franchise. The company was founded in 1999 by Robert Walsh, who is the current CEO, Steve Stamatiadis, the creative director and John Passfield, the design director who left the company in 2005. Krome has created games for the Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, Game Boy Advance, Dreamcast, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Macintosh and PC. Krome has also developed for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation Portable, Windows Phone 7, iOS and Windows 8. Krome Studios are award winning developers, that have created 19 titles on multiple platforms and languages consisting of 40 SKUs, including Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Krome’s own IP. In 2007, Krome Studios places on the Develop 100 List at #94 being the only Australian game development studio to make the list this year after releasing The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning the year before (2006). Three years later in 2010, Krome Studios was awarded the number 52 spot in the Develop 100 list, placing them alongside developers such as Sierra Entertainment, LucasArts, Epic Games, Activision, Blizzard Entertainment and Electronic Arts. Also in this year Krome Studios entered into a technology sharing agreement with Emergent Game Technologies, making them a leader in 3D video game engines. On 18 August 2010, it was reported that Krome had closed down their Adelaide studios and made significant staff cuts to their Melbourne and Brisbane offices, with as many as 100 staff let go. On 18 October 2010, it was reported that all remaining staff were let go; however, on 1 November CEO Robert Walsh responded to an email sent by IGN stating that Krome Studios had not closed down. In July 2012, Krome Studios re-opened their website which remained dormant since their fall in 2010, announcing that Ty the Tasmanian Tiger would return. Since then Krome have developed two games based on Ty the Tasmanian Tiger for iOS and PC. They have also developed several other titles for iOS, including Play Maker and Whole Wide World (for the child learning company, Fingerprint) and Toy Soldiers: Boot Camp, on Windows Phone 7. In March 2016, Krome Studios re-released an PC remastered port of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger on Steam Early Access for the PC only, with increased resolution textures, and new lighting, shadow and reflection effects."

  "text" : "A kissaten (喫茶店), literally a \"tea-drinking shop,\" is a Japanese-style tearoom that is also a coffee shop. Kissaten are particularly popular among students and business people, particularly salarymen, for breakfast. By law kissaten are able to serve sweets and tea, but almost all will also serve coffee, sandwiches, spaghetti, and other light refreshments, as well as curry rice or set meals at lunchtime. In urban areas salarymen and students frequent kissaten for breakfast where they might have \"morning service\" (mooningu saabisu) of thick toast, boiled or fried eggs, a piece of ham or bacon, and a cup of coffee. In Japan there is a distinct difference between cafes (kafe) and kissaten. The design and atmosphere of kafe is usually aimed at younger people or women, whereas kissaten are small, older establishments. There is also the very modern phenomenon of the manga kissa, which is a version of the kissaten but with video games, manga and vending machines instead of coffee."

Instead it awards public service obligation (PSO) contracts to independent operators. The agency was created on January 1, 2002 and has 35 employees and offices at Byterminalen in Stavanger. All buses operated in Rogaland are branded as Kolumbus and painted green. Before Kolumbus was created, there was several smaller companies who was responsible for the transport in the different parts of Rogaland. However, because of complications with bus lines not overlapping with each other, the bus companies finally decided to unite and become Kolumbus, or Rogaland Kollektivtrafikk (Rogaland Public Transports) as it is also known as. The companies that have contracts with Kolumbus are Tide, Nettbuss and Boreal Transport (buses) and Stavangerske, Torghatten Trafikkselskap, L. Rødne og Sønner and John Arne Helgøy (ferries). Trains are not within the responsibility on Kolumbus. NSB has the responsibility and sells tickets for almost all trains in Norway. But Kolumbus has negotiated validity for period passes for both trains and buses. There are local trains Stavanger - Sandnes and Stavanger - Egersund (Jæren Commuter Rail)."

The company’s operations have ceased and a trustee is tasked with liquidating the company’s assets for the benefit of creditors. The company was developing two types of organic solar cells: polymer-fullerene solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Konarka cells were lightweight, flexible photovoltaics that could be printed as film or coated onto surfaces. The company had hoped its manufacturing process, which utilized organic chemistry, would result in higher efficiency at lower cost than traditional crystalline silicon fabricated solar cells. Konarka was also researching infrared light activated photovoltaics which would enable night-time power generation. The company's co-founders included the Nobel laureate Alan J. Heeger. The company was named after Konark Sun Temple in India."

  "text" : "(This article is about the ferry company. For other uses, see Kangaroo Island (disambiguation).)(See also: Kangaroo Island § Sea transport)\nKangaroo Island SeaLink is a South Australian ferry company and tour operator owned by SeaLink Travel Group, which has plied the crossing from mainland South Australia to Kangaroo Island since 1989. From 1989 to 1994, Kangaroo Island Sealink was owned by the Malaysian company MBF. In 1994 the company was sold to a consortium of staff members and Kangaroo Island residents. SeaLink's two currently operating ferries, Sealion 2000 and Spirit of Kangaroo Island, cross Backstairs Passage from Cape Jervis to Penneshaw in about 45 minutes, up to 10 times daily. SeaLink had acquired the previous ferry service founded by Peter March. Its first vessel was Philanderer 3, the first of March's vessels to carry vehicles. In later years, the company operated the Island Navigator (purchased 1990), also a car carrying ferry, as the designated freight and fuel carrier. SeaLink has outlasted several competing companies since it began operations. Boat Torque, a Western Australian company, operated Superflyte from 1994 until 1997, whilst Kangaroo Island Ferries had a short-lived venture with SeaWay, from September 2004 until February 2005. Under different ownership, SeaWay recommenced services in August 2007, before its operations were suspended in May 2008 and an administrator appointed shortly thereafter. SeaLink holds a virtual monopoly on oversea transport, primarily due to its long term lease of the Cape Jervis berth. Sealink's agreement with the Government of South Australia, expiring in 2024, precludes other operators from utilising the Cape Jervis facility for one hour before, and one hour after any scheduled SeaLink service. Kangaroo Island residents have expressed displeasure with the exclusive arrangement granted to SeaLink. SeaLink had state government subsidies with respect to its freight charges, which ended in 2003."

  "text" : "Kresge-Newark was an upper-middle market department store based in Newark, New Jersey. The firm was started in the 1920s when its founder Sebastian Kresge purchased the Plautt Department store in downtown Newark and rebranded the business Kresge-Newark. This store had no management connection to the S.S. Kresge 5 & 10 chain based in Detroit, Michigan. Kresge built a handsome flagship store that occupied an entire city block. between Broad and Halsey streets, and Cedar Street and Raymond Boulevard. It contained more than 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) of selling space on ten levels (nine stories plus a basement store). Such was the store's prominence in the city that in 1927 it arranged to have a subway platform opened at its basement level, allowing customers to come in directly from streetcars; the only access was through the store. The firm positioned itself between its popular priced rival, Bamberger's, and its more upscale competitor, Hahne & Company. Kresge was the last of Newark's department stores to remain independent, and its customer loyalty was fierce. During the Christmas selling season, Kresge's operated a monorail ride around its toy department, and its Breakfast With Santa sold out early each season. In the 1940s the firm opened a multi-story parking garage, 1 block from its store. The garage located at the corner of Raymond Blvd, and Central Avenue was the only structure of its type in downtown Newark that was run by a department store. Bamberger's and Hahne's offered small surface lots next to their stores. With the opening of the garage, Kresge-Newark used the motto, \"easiest to reach, pleasantness to shop in\". This motto was related to not only the parking garage, but its (2) subway entrances, and numerous bus lines that ran along Broad Street. Kresge changed with the times by opening a branch in Summit in 1946, and in 1959 when B. Altman & Company moved its store from East Orange to Short Hills, Kresge-Newark took over the East Orange store as its location. The Summit Branch (and it was marketed under this name) initially offered home furnshings, appliances and the like, but was enlarged in the 1950s to carry a full line of merchandise. Kresge also saw the type of business lines that discount stores were fast becoming dominant in (lawn supplies, hardware, and the like), and in turn leased the top two floors of its flagship store to the Western Electric Company for use as office space. Kresge-Newark also took a lead in many civic improvements and was active in the early planning of the Gateway Center (which opened long after the store's demise). The store also formed an alliance with Asbury Park-based Steinbach. In 1964 with it clear that his heirs had no desire to take over the department store business, the Kresge Foundation sold the stores to David Chase, and they were rebranded Chase-Newark. In 1967 Chase-Newark announced it was closing, and four selling floors of the Newark flagship were leased to the Two Guys chain. The two branch stores were closed at this time and the downtown Newark location reopened as a Two Guys unit in the fall of 1967."

  "text" : "The Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (KCMMF) or Milma was registered as a co-operative society in 1980 with its head office in Thiruvananthapuram. It was brought under the Operation Flood programme of the National Dairy Development Board. KCMMF is a Federation of Regional three Regional Milk Unions, the ERCMPU, TRCMPU and MRCMPU. It follows a co-operative structure and one of the most profitable cooperatives in Kerala State. In 1983, it took over (absorbed) the production and milk marketing facilities under the Kerala Livestock and Milk Marketing Board. The board was later renamed to Kerala Livestock Development Board. A few decades ago, Kerala was seen as a dairy unfriendly State and had to depend primarily on the neighbouring States for its milk supply. However, today, Kerala is almost self-sufficient in milk production. The credit for this largely goes to Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation and its three Regional Co-operative Milk Producers Unions, for the creation of a procurement and marketing network, introduction of quality products, customer friendly policies, modern management and most important of all the integrated co-operative participation by the farmers. The Statewide network of Dairy co-operatives now operating is doing yeoman service by assuring a steady market and stable price to dairy farmers for the milk produced by them. Every success story has a humble beginning and so has been with the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (KCMMF), popularly known as Milma. Established in 1980 as the implementing agency for Operation Flood II in the State of Kerala, Milma has as its goa. “The socio-economic progress of the dairy farmer through procuring, processing and marketing of milk”. The KCMMF operates on the truly democratic lines of “of the farmer, by the farmer and for the farmer”. The Organisation has a three tier structure with the primary milk Co-operative societies at the village level, Regional Milk Producers’ Unions at the middle level and an apex body at the State level which is the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. There are three Regional Co-operative Milk Producers’ Unions operating at present. The revenue districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta come under the jurisdiction of the Thiruvananthapuram Regional Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union (TRCMPU), the districts of Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kottayam and Idukki under the Ernakulam Regional C0-operative Milk Producers’ Union (ERCMPU) and the six northern districts of Palakkad, Kannur, Malappuram, Kozhikkode, Wayanad and Kasaragod under the Malabar Regional Co-operative Milk Producers” Union (MRCMPU). The three-tier structure ensures that the farmer members are directly responsible for policy level decisions for the marketing of their produce. The farmer memberships which stood at 45000 during takeover of dairies from the erstwhile Kerala Livestock Development & Milk Marketing Board during 1983 has grown to over 8.0 lakhs through 3100 milk Co-operatives by the end of 2013-14. Similarly, milk procurement has also shown a phenomenal growth from 52,000 litres per day during 1983 to over 10,00,000 litres per day in 2013-14. The success of the marketing network and customer acceptance has been proved by the growth in sales from 55,000 litres per day during 1983 to 12,10,000 litres per day by the end of 2013-14. Keeping pace with development of milk procurement and sale, milma has concentrated on infra structural development with financial assistance from the National Dairy Development Board, Swiss Development Co-operation and other agencies. As on date, there are 13 milk processing plants with a combined processing capacity of 12.50 lakh litres per day with further expansion envisaged and 8 Milk Chilling Plants scattered across the State. A Milk Powder Plant having a capacity for production of 10 MT of milk powder per day and two cattle feed plants, one at Pattanakkad (300 MTPD) and other at Malampuzha (300 MTPD). The Pellet cattle feed manufactured in these plants are well accepted by the Dairy farmers and in the open market. The Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, in its 34th year of operation, has been one of the successfully run co-operatives of Kerala state. The peoples' strength has been seen time and again in the functioning of our organisation and this has helped us to grow as this was run by the dairy farmers for the dairy farmers. Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation is a testimony to the success of co-operative development in the hands of the people themselves."

  "text" : "For the California beverage company, see Kern's (beverage company) Kern's, or the The Ernst Kern Dry Good Company, was a department store established in Detroit in 1883 by Ernst Kern, who was born in Germany. In 1886, the original store was consumed by fire and was rebuilt at Randolph and Monroe. In 1900, the company purchased a five story building at Woodward and Gratiot to accommodate increasing business. When Ernst Kern died in 1901, his sons Ernst C. and Otto assumed control of the store. After World War I, additional space was once again needed for expansion, and the department store acquired the adjoining nine-story Weber Building. In 1929, the old structures were demolished and a new store was erected at 1048 Woodward Avenue that was 49.3 m (162 ft) high and contained ten floors. In 1957, the family decided to sell Ernst Kern Co., by then Detroit's third-largest department store, to Sattler's Inc. of Buffalo, New York. Following numerous corporate problems and changes in management, the store closed its doors for the final time on December 23, 1959. The store was demolished in the 1960s as part of Detroit's downtown urban renewal. The site remained an undeveloped park until 1999, when the Campus Martius Park project began. The former site of Kern's is now occupied by the Compuware corporate headquarters. A parking garage for Compuware is on the site formerly occupied by the neighboring Crowley's Department Store. The clock which graced the main entrance was a long-time meeting place for Detroiters, with the phrase \"I'll meet you under the clock at Kern's\" a common reminder. When the structure was demolished, the clock was placed into storage. It was reinstalled near its original location in the late 1970s. It was removed and refurbished to allow for construction of the Compuware Building and installed again in 2008 at the corner of Woodward and Gratiot Avenues."

  "text" : "The Kosciuszko Huts Association (KHA - previously spelt Kosciusko) was formed in Canberra, Australia in 1971 with the purpose of saving the mountain heritage huts in the Kosciuszko National Park. The initial meeting was supported by the past Parks commissioner, Neville Gare and resulted in a small group of individuals forming the association. KHA members went on to repair and partially rebuild over 160 mountain huts in the Park over the next decade, despite both accidental and deliberate destruction of some of them by individuals and park officers. The bush fires of 2003 destroyed a further 24 huts, following the collapse of many from the early 1970s through to 2003. There are 79 remaining huts (or groups of huts on one site) in the KNP. In 2006, the KHA was successful in lobbying ministers and the NPWS to include retention of huts in the Kosciuszko National Park Plan of Management. This also included a decision to rebuild at least six of the huts, including the Broken Dam Hut, which was reopened on 15 December 2007. Since 2007 the rebuilding campaign has progressed rapidly and initially the combination of the Kosciuszko National Park rangers and KHA members completed the build of O'Keefes Hut, Pretty Plain Hut and others. Since the construction of the original web site for KHA  the site has grown to 3000 pages of information and the new Committee commenced the construction of a new website at www.khuts.org The first site was built by members of Wildtwo Pty Ltd who held the copyright but have formally given approval for use of all the text and photographs to the KHA in perpetuity, to support the continued collection of material on the mountain huts across Australia."

The company was the world's largest fox and mink fur producer in the 1960s and 1970s, producing approximately 10% of all Finnish mink furs, equivalent to 2% of world production in 1973. After expanding into plastics production in the 1950s, the company was the first in Finland to manufacture expanded polystyrene sheets, and its brand name Styrox became synonymous with all such products in Finland. Establishing a niche expertise in plastic pipe manufacturing, the company was the first in the world to manufacture a 600 mm diameter pipe in 1964, thereby gaining international recognition. Today, the KWH Mirka Group is probably the third largest manufacturer in the world in volume terms in the \"flexible abrasives materials\" industry."

  "text" : "Kalisto Entertainment was a French video game development company founded by Nicolas Gaume at age 19. The company began as Atreid Concept in 1990 and later created the distribution label Kalisto in 1992, which became Kalisto Entertainment's namesake. In late 1993 Atreid Concept became part of Mindscape Inc. as Mindscape Bordeaux. Nicolas Gaume later bought Mindscape Bordeaux back in 1996, and renamed the company Kalisto Entertainment. Kalisto Entertainment declared bankruptcy in 2002, and company officials were found without fault by a criminal court in 2006. Civil trials are still under way. Nicolas Gaume was condemned to pay 200,000 euros by the French Stock Market Authority for repeated misinformation of his stockholders."

The Keeley Institute's location in Dwight, Illinois had a major influence on the development of Dwight as a village, though only a few indications of its significance remain in the village. After Keeley's death the institute began a slow decline but remained in operation under John R. Oughton, and, later, his son. The Institute offered the internationally known Keeley Cure, a cure which drew sharp criticism from those in the mainstream medical profession. It was wildly popular in the late 1890s. Thousands of people came to Dwight to be cured of alcoholism; thousands more sent for the mail-order oral liquid form which they took in the privacy of their homes. It began to decline after Keeley’s death.(Lender, and Martin)"

  "text" : "Kaiser Associates is a boutique strategy consulting firm based in Washington DC and London, with offices in Sao Paulo, Cape Town, Toronto, Kuala Lumpur, and Seattle . The firm was founded in 1981 as a spin-off from Strategic Planning Associates (now Oliver Wyman) by Michael Kaiser, currently President of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. The firm is noted for its benchmarking, competitive analysis, voice of customer, commercial diligence work supporting investment decisions, and other externally driven strategic development work, developed in the 1980s through extensive work with IBM and General Motors and codified in a number of books including Developing Industry Strategies: A Practical Guide of Industry Analysis (1983) and Understanding the Competition: A Practical Guide of Competitive Analysis (1981), and Beating the Competition: A Practical Guide to Benchmarking. The firm's stated mission is focused on fact-driven consulting to drive value creation. Kaiser is most frequently defined by its fact-based approach, through which it helps clients incorporate externally driven analysis into its decision making. Kaiser's notoriety for benchmarking was continued through the late 1980s and early 1990s under Robert \"Bob\" Fifer, a graduate of Harvard Business School whose primary focus was on helping corporate CEOs improve profits through novel methods. His insights were detailed in his book Double Your Profits In Six Months or Less (1995) and The Enlightened CEO: How to Succeed at the Toughest Job in Business (2007). Fifer's departure from the firm marked a transition away from a focus on benchmarking and movement towards more traditional strategic consulting, including a wider array of strategic development and organizational management work competing with other traditional management consulting firms. Kaiser's consulting work has garnered press coverage on topics such as defining innovation metrics and impact on markets, its economic development practice, and its work developing onboarding and new-hire orientation programs for major corporations. Kaiser Associates' Senior Vice President Mark Stein and Vice President Lilith Christiansen, authored \"Successful Onboarding: Strategies to Unlock Hidden Value Within Your Organization\", published by McGraw-Hill in July 2010. Mark Stein and Lilith Christiansen also published materials on the topic at the \"Onboarding Margin\" website."

  "text" : "Kruse International was an auction firm founded by Russell Kruse in Auburn, Indiana, in 1952. The company began as a local auction company selling real estate, farms and personal property run by Kruse and his sons Dean, Dennis and Daniel. The company held its first collector car auction in Auburn on Labor Day in 1971; the Labor Day auction became an annual event and grew to become the largest collector car auction in the world. After the success of this auction, the Kruses were asked by Tom Barrett to have a sale in Scottsdale, Arizona, the next January. This was the first annual sales that continue today. The Kruses were the first to sell a car for a documented $1 million in cash — a 1934 Duesenberg Model SJ La Grande long wheelbase dual-cowl phaeton. The Duesenberg was sold to Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino's Pizza and then owner of the Detroit Tigers. The Kruse family is also noted for conducting the $41 million sale of the famous William F. Harrah automotive collection. The sale of this 1,000-car collection was spread over three auction sessions in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The company was sold to ITT in 1981, but the family bought it back in 1986. It was then sold to eBay for $275 million in 1999 but was purchased back by Dean Kruse in 2002. On May 25, 2010, the Indiana Auctioneer Commission revoked the company's auctioneer's license amid charges that the company failed to pay clients who had sold items through the company. On July 1, 2010, Kruse sold its auction park, home to the annual Auburn auto auction, to RM Auctions of Canada."

  "text" : "Khmer Mekong Films (KMF) is a major Cambodian film and television production company based in Phnom Penh, capital city of Cambodia. It grew out of the team created and trained by the BBC in 2004 to make a 100-episode TV drama about HIV for Cambodian television. The Taste of Life was funded by the British Government through DFID and managed by the  BBC World Service Trust. With funding finished in 2006, producer Matthew Robinson stayed in Cambodia to form KMF with the Taste of Life Khmer production team. To date, KMF has produced dozens of television dramas, documentaries, information films, educational films, television commercials and public service TV spots. The company has also produced five Cambodian cinema films, Staying Single When (2007), Vanished (2009), 'Palace of Dreams' (2010), 'Day in the Country' (2015) & 'Price of Love' (2016). In 2015/16 'Day in the Country' won a number of awards at four international film festivals - Hollywood International Moving Pictures FF; Los Angeles International FF; New York City Indie Film Awards (including 'Best Actor' & 2nd Best Foreign Feature Film) & the Canada International Film Festival. In 2016 'Price of Love' won four awards at the Hollywood International Moving Pictures FF. KMF aims to help develop the Cambodian film industry moribund since the country was devastated by civil wars (1967–75), the Khmer Rouge regime (1975–79) and occupation by Vietnam (1979–89)."

  "text" : "King Brewery is a brewery in Nobleton, Ontario, Canada which has won a number of awards. It operates in a traditional German style, producing lagers. Owner and brewmaster Philip DiFonzo gained input from over 200 bars, pubs, taverns, and restaurants before launching in July 2002 with a single Czech-style Bohemian Pilsner. King Brewery's 20 hectolitre brewhouse with a steam-fired kettle continues to be one of very few authentic Decoction Brew houses in Canada. This popular method of brewing in Germany is rare in Canada as it takes longer and is a more expensive brewing process. The King Brewery Pilsner has won a Gold Medal at the Canadian Brewing Awards, in the class \"European Style Lager (Pilsner)\", as well as the 2004 Toronto Star Beer of the Year. The King Brewery Dark Lager has won a Bronze Medal in the class \"Dark Lager\"."

  "text" : "K's Merchandise Mart, Inc. (usually known as simply K's Merchandise) was a catalog showroom department store based in Decatur, Illinois. It offered furniture, jewelry, and general merchandise, including electronics, at 17 locations in 5 Midwestern states at the time of its closing. K's was founded in 1957 by Raymond \"Ray\" Eldridge Sr. and his brother Kay. However, by the 2000s, competition from big box stores had eroded K's sales for years, though it had 17 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Kentucky. Boston's Gordon Brothers Group took over the company from the original family, appointing Bill Weinstein as president. After an attempt at turning around the stores' operations, K's announced on 3 October 2006 that it would liquidate and close to pay off its creditors in full. K's Merchandise also operated four chain stores by the name of \"Bargain's Only\", and had locations in Mt Zion, Champaign, Springfield and Peoria, Illinois. These stores closely resembled a TJ Maxx style offering, with clothing, household goods and furniture. They closed in front of their parent stores, with the final store closing in October 2006 in Mt. Zion."

Kadey-Krogen Yachts is a semi-custom builder and manufactures 10-15 yachts per year. Five models are currently offered, ranging in size from 44 to 58 feet (13 to 18 m) with new models on the drawing board. Defining aspects of the Kadey-Krogen trawler yacht are a pure full displacement hull, a fine forward entry, a wineglass transom, a fully covered aft deck which functions as the back porch, and high quality interior joinery predominantly in teak or cherry with other selections available. Their design enables the yachts to make ocean passages in comfort and safety. Owners of Kadey-Krogen trawler yachts have reported crossing the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea. Kadey-Krogen is headquartered in Stuart, Florida, with other offices in Annapolis and Seattle. Unlike the majority of boat manufacturers, the company does not use a dealership network, but instead works directly with customers. For the past 21 years the company's boats have been built at a dedicated yard in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Kadey-Krogens are sold direct through an in-house sales team. Kadey-Krogen's yachts are often used as liveaboard vessels. According to company estimates, up to 75-percent of owners are part- or full-time liveaboards. While most owners have or are in the process of retiring, many continue to work and utilize their last few years working to take small trip and get acquainted with their boat and the lifestyle."

KKS bought twenty motorized trams from Schuckert & Co. and twelve trailers, designated as Class S. It built two depots, Sagene and Rodeløkka. The company was created after a political shift whereby the municipal council decided to start operating trams. The company operated a mix of line services, most of the lines operating every ten minutes. KKS failed to make a profit. After the 1904 elections the majority in the municipal council shifted. The company was privatized in May 1905 and sold to KSS after the municipal council had rejected purchasing the very same company."

  "text" : "A/S Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei or KES, nicknamed the Blue Tramway (Norwegian: Blåtrikken), was a company which operated part of the Oslo Tramway between 1894 and 1924. It built a network of four lines in Western Oslo, the Briskeby Line and the Frogner Line which ran to Majorstuen, and two other consecutive lines, the Skøyen Line and the Lilleaker Line. These all connected to a common line through the city center which terminated at Jernbanetorget. KES was established as the second tram operator in Oslo (then known as Kristiania). When it commenced services it was the first electric tramway in Scandinavia. It originally opened the Briskeby Line and the Skøyen Line to Skillebekk using a fleet of Class A trams. Later the company also ordered Class U and Class SS trams, for a total 78 motor cars and 66 trailers. Skøyen was reached in 1903. The first part of the Frogner Line opened in 1902, and it was completed in 1914. The Lilleaker Line was built to Lilleaker in 1919. KES and its competitor, Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) were both taken over by Oslo Municipality in May 1924 and became Oslo Sporveier. The take-over did not include the Lilleaker Line and this part of the operation continued as Bærumsbanen."

  "text" : "KidZui was a web browser designed for children developed by KidZui, Inc. The KidZui browser used a Zooming User Interface paradigm to make browsing easier for children. Search results appeared as scaled down images of websites, videos, and pictures that children click on to zoom in and see content. Children can also browse by category without typing search terms. The KidZui browser did not access the open Internet. KidZui uses teachers and parents to screen content and maintains a database of approved URLs. The KidZui browser could only access URLs in the approved database. Children built avatars called Zuis to represent themselves online. They earned points for web browsing and used points to gain levels and buy clothes and accessories for their Zuis. Children could share KidZui content with friends online. To add a friend online, children needed to know the friends Zui name. There was no online directory of Zui names, so children needed to get their friends Zui names offline in order to add them. Friends also needed to be approved by parents before they become available in the browser. KidZui also tracked children’s Internet usage and sends reports to their parents on what their children looked at online. KidZui began development on the product in the summer of 2006. After beta testing, KidZui was offered to the general public on March 19, 2008. The KidZui browser and basic reports for parents are free. KidZui makes revenue through a paid membership program. Membership gives kids additional features like more available clothing and accessories for Zuis, more background and themes, and the ability to get to higher levels with points. Membership gives parents more reporting capabilities to track their children’s online activity, and more ways to customize the KidZui browser for their children. KidZui was designed for children between the ages of 3 and 12 years old. KidZui had a focus on children’s online safety, but they also tried to expand the content available to children online. Rather than solely using filters, KidZui trained and enlisted parents and teachers to search out content that is appropriate for children even if it was not designed expressly for children. Websites that had been reviewed and approved by KidZui could carry a KidZui seal of approval that indicate the site’s content is appropriate for children. Websites that carried the seal agree to abide by KidZui’s content guidelines. Kid Zui was also a prize on the 3rd round on the Nickelodeon game show BrainSurge. In August 2014, LeapFrog purchased KidZui. The terms of the deal were not disclosed."

They first began to develop original properties, beginning with their visually appealing early 3D fighting games, Criticom, Dark Rift and Cardinal Syn (referred to as the \"Trilogy of Terror\" by one gaming journalist). The organization later gained greater critical and commercial success for the Fear Effect series with Eidos, although Kronos retains all rights to the franchise. Kronos was busy developing the third installment in that series, Fear Effect Inferno, when publisher Eidos discontinued funding for the project following a major restructuring of their budget. The developer then shopped it around to other publishers but were unable to secure another deal to get the game finished. The company disbanded soon after, with Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix being their final released game."

The Today Show (NBC TV), The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch (CNBC) and other media have compared Knockouts to Hooters restaurants for the sex appeal/entertainment angle used to engage customers, labeling Knockouts “the Hooters of Haircutting.” The salons have a gym/warehouse-like decor with faux boxing ring posts and ropes and a brick wall helping to define the space, as well as boxing photos and memorabilia on the walls. There are flat-screen televisions at each grooming station and in the waiting area. These are usually tuned to sports programs, but are individually controlled by the customer. Knockouts employs an attractive all-female staff of licensed hair stylists and massage therapists. The services include haircuts, hair coloring, waxing, manicures, pedicures, and six types of massage therapy. Grooming products are also available for purchase. Some locations also offer hair replacement and facial shaves. Knockouts salons provide a free beverage to customers while they wait, including water, sports drinks and beer (where legally permitted). Knockouts has sold over 500 franchised salons in 29 states."

The company was wholly owned by Taubåtkompaniet, owned by Ole T. Bjørnevik, and operated one cruiseferry, MS Kongshavn. It ceased operations on 21 October 2008. The company was established in 2006, following the bankruptcy of Kystlink AS. The company acquired MS Pride of Telemark, but the ship had an accident on 11 September 2007, and was for the rest of the company's history in dry dock. After this, Kystlink acquired MS Fantaasia from Estonian Tallink, changing the name to Kongshavn. The ship was described by Håkan Ågård in the Swedish Maritime Administration as the worst he had ever seen, with severe lacks to maintenance, though pointed out the responsibility was that of Tallink and not Kystlink. This point of view had protested by the Estonian Maritime Administration and in July 2008 supported by Paris MOU. On October 20, 2008, the company announced that its ferry service would conclude on October 21, and the company would be liquidated."

It uses the brands Grimselstrom and Grimselwelt, the latter specifically for its tourism ventures. Both brands are named after the Grimsel Pass that forms the upper end of its operating area. Founded in 1925, the company had its first power plant, Handeck 1, online by 1932. Currently, KWO is operating nine plants, fed by the reservoirs of Grimselsee, Oberaarsee, Räterichsbodensee, Gelmersee and Totensee, with a total of 26 turbines giving a total maximum power output of 1.125 Gigawatts. The company produces around 2,350 Gigawatt hours of electricity annually, which represents about 7% of the country's total hydroelectric energy production. The company also owns the Meiringen–Innertkirchen railway, the Gelmerbahn funicular, and the Sidelhornbahn, Triftbahn and Tällibahn aerial lifts. All of these were originally built to assist the construction and maintenance of its hydroelectric plants, but now provide transport for local residents and/or tourists. Additionally the Kraftwerke Oberhasli operates and maintains the Reichenbachfall funicular, although this is owned by the neighbouring EWR Energie company. KWO employs 530 people, or a total of 364 full-time jobs."

The first is through a mobile search service known as 542542 (kgbkgb). It launched January 5, 2009, following the launch of the similar 118118 \"Ask Us Anything\" service in the United Kingdom. In February 2013, after investigation by the US Department of Labor, a judge ordered kgb to pay $1.3 million to internet researchers who had been sharply underpaid. The company has also entered the internet group buying space with a business called kgbdeals. kgbdeals seeks to offer lifestyle deals to consumers in the US, UK, France and Italy."

(コーエーテクモホールディングス株式会社 Kōē Tekumo Hōrudingusu Kabushiki-gaisha), is a holding company created in 2009 by the merger of Japanese video game companies Koei and Tecmo. It was founded as Tecmo Koei Holdings. Koei Europe was the first subsidiary to change its name to Tecmo Koei Europe, Ltd and to release video games under the new moniker. In January 2010, Tecmo, Inc. and Koei Corporation followed suit by merging to form Tecmo Koei America Corporation. In April 1, 2010, Tecmo was declared disbanded in Japan. Its sister company Koei survived but was renamed Tecmo Koei Games and is now the sole publishing arm of the group. Koei Tecmo Games continues to strategically use the \"Tecmo\" and \"Koei\" brand names on new video games for marketing purposes. In addition, the former development divisions of Tecmo and Koei were briefly spun-off as separate companies in March 2010, but folded into Tecmo Koei Games in April 2011. The continued operating loss prompted Kenji Matsubara, the former president and CEO of both Tecmo Koei Holdings and Tecmo Koei Games label, to render his resignation in November 2010. Yoichi Erikawa, co-founder of Koei, took over the four positions vacated by Matsubara. On July 1, 2014, the company was renamed as Koei Tecmo."

When Telsim was taken over by the Vodafone Group on 23 August 2006, it became a subsidiary of the global Vodafone Group. The company still operates under the brand KKTC Telsim in Northern Cyprus, although in Turkey Telsim has been rebranded Vodafone. This is due to Vodafone Group having a partnership agreement with the Cytamobile-Vodafone network in Southern Cyprus. The exclusive agreement on the use of the Vodafone brandname covers the entire territory claimed by Republic of Cyprus, thus including Northern Cyprus so the use of the Vodafone brand by a company other than Cytamobile is not allowed on the entire island of Cyprus."

  "text" : "The Keystone Bridge Company, founded in 1865 by Andrew Carnegie, was an important American bridge building company. It was one of the 28 companies absorbed into the American Bridge Company in 1900. The company advertised its services for building steel, wrought iron, wooden railway and road bridges. It held a patent for wrought iron bridges and also supplied wrought iron columns for buildings. Thomas Carnegie worked for Keystone Bridge as treasurer for roughly 20 years, from the founding of the company until his death in 1886. Keystone is perhaps best remembered for the Eads Bridge in St. Louis, completed in 1874, which survives to this day. A number of its works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Carnegie sold his company, Carnegie Steel Company to J.P. Morgan in 1901. Works include (attribution): \n* Fairground Street Bridge (built 1895), spans ICG RR yard on Fairground St. Vicksburg, MS (Keystone Bridge Co.), NRHP-listed \n* Hannibal Bridge or Kansas City Bridge, spanned the Missouri River at Kansas City, MO, (constructed 1867-9) for the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad.

  "text" : "Kuwahara Company (桑原商会 Kuwahara Shōkai) is a Japanese bicycle company manufacturing both bicycles and parts. The company was started as a small family business in Osaka, Japan in 1918 by Sentarō Kuwahara (桑原仙太郎). With his wife and eight children, he began a local bicycle parts wholesale. In 1925, Kuwahara began to export bicycles and parts to Russia, China and Southeast Asia, closing the business from 1940 to 1945 during World War II. 1959 saw the first delivery of Kuwahara bikes to the USA. Sentaro Kuwahara died the following year, with his son Masao taking his place. In 1962, Kuwahara sent its first shipment of Apollo brand sport bicycles to Canada and, in 1968, began exporting private label bikes to the USA for other companies such as Schwinn, Takara, Puch, and Azuki. The first Kuwahara branded bikes for export came in 1972 when it began developing BMX bicycles for the North American, European and Australian markets. Howie Cohen — who had previously operated West Coast Cycle, importer of Nishiki bikes — founded the company, Everything Bicycles, and worked with Kuwahara to build and import BMX bikes carrying the \"Kuwahara\" brand name, developing the first major BMX distributorship. To make the Kuwahara brand name a household word, Cohen ran a promotion giving free stickers to children who called a toll-free phone number and could correctly pronounce the brand name. In 1989, Cohen sold the Kuwahara name back to the Japanese parent company. The Kuwahara brand gained international recognition and popularity when its BMX model was used in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Following the success of the film, Kuwahara began producing red and white \"ET\" models in three price and quality levels. Kuwahara reissued the ET model in 2002, as part of ET's twentieth anniversary. In 2007, lead singer Tom Meighan of rock group Kasabian purchased the screen used bike for £10,000. Takuo Kuwahara started Kuwahara International in 1988."

Indigo remained the majority owner, with investors including Borders Group, Cheung Kong Holdings, and REDgroup Retail taking minority stakes. As of March 2010, Indigo Books & Music owned 58% of Kobo Inc. Rakuten acquired the company from these owners in January 2012.

Klarna allows users to pay with simply an email address, billing the customer later and paying the retailer in the meantime. Their business model thus differs from that of other online payment companies, which collect payment from the customer immediately and then forward the money to the retailer. About 40% of all e-commerce sales in Sweden goes through Klarna. The company has more than 1400 employees, most of them working at the headquarters in Stockholm. In 2014, the company handled about $10 billion in online sales."

  "text" : "King Schools, Inc. is an American computer software company headquartered in San Diego, California, USA. The company focuses on the creation of Computer Based Training (CBT) or E-learning, to assist individuals in obtaining all levels of Pilot certification in the United States. Over the years, the company has expanded its training courses to cover the various pilot certificates, ratings and educational requirements, along with many aeronautical elective studies. More recently, it has begun offering all of its courses in Web-based training (WBT) and mobile device formats. King Schools was founded in 1975, by John King and Martha King, husband and wife. As Certificated Flight Instructors, the Kings first began as a traveling ground school, offering two-day courses in various cities. A little more than a decade later, they began producing training videos that other flight instructors could incorporate into their own curriculum. Eventually, demand for their videos by individuals learning to fly led to the development of courses that could be used for self-paced study. As of May 2010, King Schools has over 70 employees and operates exclusively from an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) facility near Montgomery Field. Course development, production, customer service and shipping all occur at this location. Course videos are filmed either in the in-house digital studio or at nearby Montgomery Field. John and Martha King are two of the most recognized experts in flight instruction and King Schools is best known for its effective use of a folksy, humor-rich approach in their training videos characteristic of the King's presentation style. The company claims that more than half of all pilots in the United States have studied using one of their courses. Of the courses they offer, the Private Pilot Knowledge Test Course is likely the most used, supporting FAA Part 61 ground schools. Among the approximately 90 other courses offered, topics covered include Private Pilot, Instrument Pilot, Commercial Pilot, International Operations and risk management. King Schools also produces the Cessna-branded courses used by Cessna Pilot Centers, which are Part 141 ground schools."

Kabam markets freemium games for mobile devices, and social networking services,. The company's investors include Alibaba, Canaan Partners, Google, MGM, Intel, Pinnacle Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Warner Bros. and others.

In late 2009, Kabam launched Kingdoms of Camelot, one of the first successful strategy games on Facebook, but in June 2010, the number of players began constantly shrinking. As of April 2015, Kabam has announced a shift in its focus to developing AAA mobile games. In July 2015, Kabam announces that Marvel Contest of Champions hit $100 million in gross revenue in seven months, the fastest of any game in Kabam history (The Hobbit was next fastest at 13 months)."

  "text" : "Julius Kayser & Co., the predecessor to the modern Kayser-Roth Corporation, was founded in the early 20th century by Julius Kayser and was a notable manufacturer of hosiery, lingerie and gloves. In 1958, the company purchased the Chester H. Roth Company, forming Kayser-Roth. Alfred P. Slaner, the first head of the merged company, developed Supp-Hose hosiery. In 1973, in order to compete with the L'eggs brand (currently owned by HanesBrands), Kayser-Roth launched No Nonsense, which was one of the first brands of hosiery to be sold in supermarkets, drugstores and discount department stores. In 1975 Kayser-Roth was purchased by conglomerate Gulf+Western. In the years under Gulf+Western's stewardship, improvements were made to Canadian manufacturing plants, most notably in Ontario and Quebec. Forays into diverse markets such as the automotive industry were carried out. During the late-1970s and early-1980s almost every automobile produced had Kayser-Roth components on board. In 1985 Gulf+Western began divesting all of its non-entertainment enterprises, with Kayser-Roth being sold to the Wickes Companies. Eight years later the Mexican hosiery manufacturer Grupo Synkro purchased the company for approximately US$230,000,000. In 1999, Italian Golden Lady, the largest hosiery manufacturer in Europe, acquired Kayser-Roth Corporation from Grupo Synkro and reorganized the company. During the 2000s (decade), the No Nonsense brand expanded to include bras, panties, sleepwear, socks for women and men, and foot comfort products. In April 2011, Kayser-Roth partnered to become an exclusive distributor of socks and hosiery for Jockey International. Today, Kayser-Roth products are featured on the television show Gossip Girl and have also previously been showcased on The View."

KAITEC was later renamed as the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH). Following a re-organisation of government research institutes in 1999, KITECH was the largest institute grouped under the Korea Research Council for Industrial Science and Technology (ISTK), currently under the supervision of the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. KITECH's focus is on the development and management of manufacturing technologies for SMEs. KITECH receives both government and private funding, and distributes most of its research grants to private companies. By the middle of the 1990s, KITECH's annual budget was around US$130 billion, and employed a staff of one thousand in five sub-institutes. The institute conducted materials research into environmentally friendly manufacture of metal alloys, and sold the technology to the private sector for 28.2 billion won. It also fostered the exchange of technological know-how with foreign research institutes by creating the Global Venture Investment Center in Seoul. Together with Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI) and the company Rotem, KITECH developed the HSR-350x, a high-speed train with domestic technology. The institute also participated in the development of the android prototypes EveR-1 and 2."

  "text" : "The company was founded in Melbourne in 1986. as an international electronics trading firm, in a spare bedroom, by Rosmin Robertson (née Jaffer) and Bruce Robertson, Bruce developed the ground-breaking KI2000 Optical Light Source and KI020 Optical Talk Set. Bruce Robertson's technical involvement in fiber optics started 1980 - 1985, when he was a researcher at GEC's Hirst Research Centre in the UK, developing novel fiber optic cable designs, manufacturing processes, fiber optic sensors & instrumentation, and was awarded various patents. In 1988, the business moved to a large garage, further contracts were won, and an Australian Federal R&D Grant was received for early development work on optical power meters, which culminated in the release of the KI6000 series power meters soon afterwards. The company has always emphasized product quality and performance, so first achieved ISO9001 certification in 1994, and achieved Asia's first NATA accredited public optical calibration laboratory in 1993. The company continues to offer the industry's most accurate test equipment. In 1991, Kingfisher had grown into its first factory in Rowville. Kingfisher then located in facility in Scoresby from 2001 to May 2015, when it moved to new premises at 720 Springvale Road, Mulgrave Victoria 3170. The company has always made its products in Australia. Kingfisher is one of the oldest fiber optic test companies, and is regarded by industry elders as having a significant influence on the development of the industry. Kingfisher products are used by professional technicians when installing and maintaining fiber optic cabling and systems, and its fiber optic test equipment range includes such items as, optical power meters, optical light sources, optical loss test sets, optical test and inspection kits, variable optical attenuators, inspection microscopes and various optical fault locators. The company has worldwide distribution channels, and currently participates in various national and international standards development groups. Since 2014, Kingfisher International has been wholly owned and managed by co-founder Bruce Robertson."

Kaggle also hosts recruiting competitions in which data scientists compete for a chance to interview at leading data science companies like Facebook, Winton Capital, and Walmart. In April 2015, Kaggle released the first version of their Scripts product onto their platform. Scripts allows users to write, run, and publicly share their code on Kaggle. In January 2016, Kaggle released their Datasets product, making a selection of public datasets available on Kaggle. Each datasets has Scripts enabled, as well as a dedicated forum, allowing for conversation and collaboration between data scientists and the work they are doing on each dataset. On 8 July 2016, Kaggle renamed its Scripts product to Kernels."

  "text" : "The KarMel Brewing Co. is a beer brewery/distributor currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The brewery was started by Jürgen Björn Jensen (1858–1937) in 1893 in the small town of Herlev, Denmark. Ever since its incarnation, the brewery has remained a family company. Jürgen began brewing his own flavors in his father's basement in 1891, and slowly gained a following in his town. The early Jensen immigrants then migrated to the United States in 1901, where they began a swine farm. The beer is now mostly known for its pork-infused brews, an idea Jürgen originally conceived in 1909, on his farm. The prohibition era put a significant damper on production, however, and the brewery all but disappeared for several years. It was only in the final days of the Great Depression, after Jürgen's passing, that his son Arthur elected to resurrect the company from the ground up. Today, the company remains small, only brewing 110 barrels per year, and importing them to the U.S. East Coast. In 2011, the K.M.B.C. is celebrating 118 years by attending the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Beer Festival. Employees from the factory, as well as the President and current Owner: Karl Sören Jensen, are expected to be in attendance."

His sons, Karl and younger brother Wilhelm, took on the business in 1904, renaming the foundry Gebrüder Klingspor in 1906, and turned it into a major concern. Famous type designers like Rudolf Koch, Walter Tiemann and Otto Eckmann worked for this foundry and created well known typefaces like Koch Antiqua, Wilhelm Klingspor, Tiemann Antiqua and Eckmann. Starting in 1925, Klingspor types were distributed in the United States by Continental Type Founders Association. The foundry closed in 1956 when it was acquired by D. Stempel AG, which had held a majority stake in the company since 1917. The right of the typefaces was transfered to D. Stempel AG, Frankfurt am Main which then had been transferred to Linotype. Many original designs can be seen in the Klingspor Museum in Offenbach am Main."

It is said there are over 1,000 different kinds of alcoholic beverages in Korea. With the Yin Yang philosophy, each type of SOOL serves the occasions, such as marriage, harvest, longevity and so on. Most K-SOOL have been made from rice, of both glutinous and non-glutinous variety, which are fermented with the aid of yeast and nuruk (a wheat-based source of the enzyme amylase). In addition, fruits, flowers, herbs and other natural ingredients have been also used to craft traditional Korean alcoholic beverages. There are 6 distinguished flavors in K-SOOL; Sweet, Sour, Pungent, Roasted, Bitter and Spicy tastes, and when they are all harmonized in balance, SOOL is considered to be a quality liquor. K-SOOL is divided into three categories: Gwasilju (Fruit Liquor), Jeungryuju (Distilled Liquor), and Takju/Yakju (Rice Liquor). The first K-SOOL tasting event is scheduled to be held in New York City from June 5 to 7, 2012."

  "text" : "Kessel Food Markets was an American supermarket chain based in Michigan. It began in 1981 when Owosso, Michigan native Al Kessel, a former executive vice president of Hamady Brothers supermarkets, purchased Kroger locations in Corunna and Saginaw. Kroger closed these stores due to Michigan's poor economy at the time, and failure to reach union agreements. After Kroger closed all five of its Flint locations in 1982 for the same reasons, Kessel purchased them as well, followed by 13 Hamady stores after that chain filed for bankruptcy in 1991. At its peak, Kessel Food Markets comprised 24 stores. Kessel filmed his own television commercials for the chain, in which he would throw items into a grocery cart and state, \"Save at Kessel this week. Why? Because we're with you.\" The Kessel chain was frequently targeted by workers' unions in Saginaw. By 1999, four of the Kessel stores had been converted to Save-A-Lot or closed, while the rest were sold to Kroger, which briefly continued to operate them under the Kessel name before converting them. Kessel's company, Kessel Enterprises of Grand Blanc, Michigan, continued to operate the Save-a-Lot stores and local Pet Supplies Plus stores. Kessel died December 28, 2012 at age 74 of esophageal cancer, in Naples, Florida."

The studio produced Hoodwinked!,which was one of the first computer-animated films to be entirely independently financed.The film was produced on a budget of less than $8 million,considerably less than the typical budget for an animated film.To save costs, Kanbar Entertainment founded the animation studio Digital Eyecandy in Manila, Philippines to create most of the film's animation.The Weinstein Company signed on as the film's distributor near the end of its productionand it was released in December 2005.The film received mixed critical reviews, but was financially successful, earning over $110 million worldwide. Hoodwinked!'s success led to a sequel being announced in January 2006.Although Kanbar Entertainment originally intended to finance the film entirely on its own as it had done with the first film, it was convinced by The Weinstein Company to enter into a co-financing agreement with the studio.This allowed the film to be produced on a larger budget than its predecessor at $30 million.The film was initially scheduled for a January 2010 release, but in December 2009, The Weinstein Company postponed the release date.Kanbar Entertainment sued The Weinstein Company in April 2011, claiming that the delay violated their agreement and also accusing the studio of not contributing to monthly production accounts after February, 2009, neglecting to consult them on a release strategy, and failing to respond to proposed changes to the film, even though they held \"final authority on production decisions\". Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil was eventually released in April 2011 to almost universally negative critical reviewsand financial failure, earning $16.9 million worldwide; only about half of its budget. Kanbar Entertainment enlisted InterWorks, Inc. to create an Android based video game of Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil. Kanbar Entertainment had several ideas proposed to them by InterWorks, Inc. and chose Hoodwinked Too! Decoder Game, which was released on the Android Market in correlation with the film's April 29, 2011 release date. Kanbar Entertainment also produced Lifelines (film), which was released in 2009 and Seducing Charlie Barker (film), which was released in 2010."

In 1967 all private lotteries were banned and the Government of Kerala started the Kerala State Lotteries. The idea behind the setup of the new department under the Ministry of Finance, (Government of Kerala) was from the then Finance Minister of the state, Shri. P. K. Kunju Sahib. The objectives of starting Kerala state lottery were providing employment. to and supplementing the government finance without disturbing the public. The department soon became a model for other states in India. Soon many other states jumped into the bandwagon by starting their own lotteries. The department now has around 465 employees under its Directorate located at Vikas Bhavan at Thiruvananthapuram, 14 District Offices and a Regional Deputy Directorate at Ernakulam. The department which was initially under the Department of Finance was later brought under the Taxes Department. The Kerala State Lotteries included different types of Lottery Draws with Different Prize structure weekly and few Bumper Lotteries too. Here we have listed all the different types of Kerala Lottery results with their respective release date."

  "text" : "Kosmos Energy is an American international oil company founded and based in Dallas, Texas. It also maintains offices in the Bermudas, Morocco, Suriname and Ghana. It has been involved in the discovery and development of the Jubilee oil field off the coast of Ghana. Kosmos was a focus of the BBC documentary Storyville: Power, Money, Greed and Oil. From 19 December 2014, the company started a highly controversial oil drilling in the Cap Boujdour area off the coast of Western Sahara. The license is signed with the Moroccan state oil company ONHYM. The UN stated in 2002 that any further oil exploration in Western Sahara would be in violation of international law if it was not in accordance with the wishes of the people of the territory. In an article from February 2015, former UN legal counsel Hans Corell stated that the ongoing exploration activities by Kosmos and Glencore is in violation of the legal opinion he wrote for the UN Security Council. On March 2, 2015 Kosmos Energy said it drilled dry at its CB-1 exploration well at the Cap Boujdour area. Despite this, the company is planning for a second drill. On April 28, 2015 Kosmos Energy has made a significant gas discovery at its Tortue-1 development well in Block C-8, offshore Mauritania. The well was drilled to test the Tortue West prospect, which forms part of the Greater Tortue complex. It was drilled to a 4,630m depth, where it encountered 107m of net hydrocarbon pay and a single gas pool in the primary Lower Cenomanian objective."

The system is an electronic alternative to informal Hawala systems, traditional international bank transfers and older remittance networks where the minimum transfer fees would often make it uneconomical to send low value payments that are typical for migrant workers and relatives of the island communities.

It is promoted by GIZ-German Agency for International Cooperation and the Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME) under the aegis of an umbrella bilateral development programme jointly supported by Government of Federal Republic of Germany and Government of India. KNN provides news and information to the mainstream media – both print and electronic, fed through a national network of over 156 KNN member industry associations. and 110 institutions. The Micro, small and Medium Enterprises. (MSME) are considered the back bone of the Indian economy. Over 40 million in number, cumulatively they are the second largest employer after agriculture and contribute over 35% to exports and almost 40% to industrial production. However, the MSME sector is largely unorganized and operates in informal setting. Due to their unorganized nature, their views and news seldom reach to policy makers. This results in a structural gap in information-feedback-loop critical for formulation of demand driven policies and schemes. While MSMEs rightly complain about bad policies, the policy makers do not have sufficient information to frame right response. KNN aims to enable two-way flow of information from MSMEs to both policy makers and institutions and vice versa."

Founded in Warsaw in 1858 as an iron foundry by a shipbuilding magnate Andrzej Artur Zamoyski and led by Konstanty Rudzki, it soon expanded into machinery, steel and engineering. By the end of the 19th century the company, with its seat in Warsaw and a large factory in Mińsk Mazowiecki, had become one of the largest and most experienced bridge construction contractors in Central and Eastern Europe, with roughly 20% of bridges constructed in the Russian Empire bearing the logo of K. Rudzki. After World War I the company declined and ceased its machinery production arm, but continued on as an engineering and construction business. It was nationalised and liquidated after World War II. Throughout its existence the company was responsible for some of the most innovative bridge undertakings in the world, including the 1914 Poniatowski Bridge, the 1916 Khabarovsk Bridge (for decades the longest bridge in Eurasia at over 2,500 metres in length) and the 1927 Maurzyce Bridge, the first welded road bridge in the world."

It then developed during the East German era into a live music venue where many notable German bands played regularly. Gentrification of the surrounding area in the late 2000s led to complaints about the club's noise from residents of newly constructed apartment buildings nearby. A court case resulted, placing restrictions on the noise levels, which the owners judged made the club financially untenable, resulting in its closure on 31 December 2010. After efforts to reopen in another district, the club secured new premises in Prenzlauer Berg and announced in February 2013 that they planned to reopen in 2016."

The products are currently produced by manufacturers such as Whirlpool, GE, Panasonic, Sanyo, LG, Bosch, Electrolux, and Mabe Mexico. The brand is controlled by Sears Holdings, and owned by KCD IP, LLC, a special purpose entity created by Sears Holdings for securitization purposes. The name \"KCD IP\" is an abbreviation for Kenmore Craftsman DieHard intellectual property. Today the brand is sold at all Sears Holdings stores, including Sears and, since 2005, at Kmart. In 2016, the Kenmore brand was expanded into consumer electronics with the launch of Kenmore-branded high definition (Kenmore HDTV) and ultra HD (Kenmore Elite UHDTV) televisions."
