  "text" : "Intel Corporation (also known as Intel or intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California (colloquially referred to as \"Silicon Valley\") that was founded by legends Gordon Moore (of Moore's Law fame) and Robert Noyce. It and AMD are the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue., and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Inc., Lenovo (formerly IBM), Hewlett Packard, Inc. and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968 by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics. The fact that \"intel\" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate. Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business. During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs, and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry. Intel was placed at #56 on the 2015 rankings of the world's most valuable brands published by Millward Brown Optimor. The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland, Intel Array Building Blocks, and Threading Building."

  "text" : "IKEA (/aɪˈkiːə/; Swedish: [ɪˈkeːˈa]) is a multinational group of companies that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture (such as beds, chairs and desks), appliances and home accessories. As of January 2008, it is the world's largest furniture retailer. Founded in Sweden in 1943 by then-17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad, who was listed as one of the world's richest people in 2013, the company's name is an acronym that consists of the initials of Ingvar Kamprad, Elmtaryd (the farm where he grew up), and Agunnaryd (his hometown in Småland, southern Sweden). The company is known for its modern architectural designs for various types of appliances and furniture, and its interior design work is often associated with an eco-friendly simplicity. In addition, the firm is known for its attention to cost control, operational details, and continuous product development, corporate attributes that allowed IKEA to lower its prices by an average of two to three percent over the decade to 2010 during a period of global expansion. The IKEA group has a complex corporate structure, the purpose or one of the purposes of which may be to avoid tax, and is controlled by several foundations based in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. As of September 2016, IKEA owns and operates 389 stores in 48 countries. In fiscal year 2010, US$23.1 billion worth of goods were sold, a total that represented a 7.7 percent increase over 2009. The IKEA website contains about 12,000 products and is the closest representation of the entire IKEA range. There were over 470 million visitors to IKEA's websites in the year from September 2007 to September 2008. The company is responsible for approximately 1% of world commercial-product wood consumption, making it one of the largest users of wood in the retail sector."

Activision finally shut down the Infocom division in 1989, although they released some titles in the 1990s under the Infocom Zork brand. Activision abandoned the Infocom trademark in 2002. The name was later registered by Oliver Klaeffling of Germany in 2007, which itself was abandoned the following year. The Infocom trademark is currently held by Pete Hottelet's Omni Consumer Products, who registered the name around the same time as Klaeffling in 2007."

Its main shareholders were Carlton Communications and Granada plc, two franchises of the ITV network. Starting as ONdigital in 1998, the service was re-branded as ITV Digital in July 2001. Low audience figures and an ultimately unaffordable multimillion-pound deal with the Football League led to the broadcaster suffering massive losses; these forced it to enter administration in March 2002. The service ceased permanently in June 2002, with the terrestrial multiplexes subsequently taken over by Crown Castle and the BBC to create Freeview in October 2002."

Originally, factories were to be located in Moscow, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Kharkov, but due to the approach of Nazi German troops, the Moscow facilities were moved to Irbit, and the Leningrad and Kharkov facilities to Gorkiy (now called Nizhny Novgorod). A similar design is the Soviet (now Ukrainian) Dnepr motorcycle. Both Ural and Dnepr motorcycles are sometimes known by the generic name, \"Cossack motorcycles,\" which was used between 1973 and 1979 by SATRA in the United Kingdom. Plans for the M-72 were later sold to the Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation, a Chinese industrial firm, to build the Chang Jiang."

  "text" : "IG Farben was a German chemical and pharmaceutical industry conglomerate. Its name is taken from Interessen-Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AktienGesellschaft (Plc Syndicate [literally, \"community of interests\"] of dye-making corporations). The company was formed in 1925 from a number of major chemical companies that had been working together closely since World War I. During its heyday, IG Farben was both the largest company in Europe overall and the largest chemical and pharmaceutical company in the world. IG Farben scientists made fundamental contributions to all areas of chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Notably IG Farben scientists discovered the first antibiotic, fundamentally reformed medical research and \"opened a new era in medicine.\" Otto Bayer discovered the polyaddition for the synthesis of polyurethane in 1937. Several IG Farben scientists were awarded Nobel Prizes. Carl Bosch and Friedrich Bergius were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931 \"in recognition of their contributions to the invention and development of chemical high pressure methods\". Gerhard Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939 \"for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil\". Kurt Alder was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950 for his \"discovery and development of the diene synthesis\". Following the Nazi takeover of Germany, the company became embroiled in the Nazi regime's policies as a large government contractor. In 1951, IG Farben was split into its four largest original constituent companies, which remain some of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The current main successor companies are AGFA, BASF, Bayer and Sanofi."

It provides free public access to collections of digitized materials, including web sites, software applications/games, music, movies/videos, moving images, and nearly three million public-domain books. As of May 2014, its collection topped 15 petabytes. In addition to its archiving function, the Archive is an activist organization, advocating for a free and open Internet. The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers, which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible. Its web archive, the Wayback Machine, contains over 150 billion web captures. The Archive also oversees one of the world's largest book digitization projects. Founded by Brewster Kahle in May 1996, the Archive is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit operating in the United States. It has an annual budget of $10 million, derived from a variety of sources: revenue from its Web crawling services, various partnerships, grants, donations, and the Kahle-Austin Foundation.Its headquarters are in San Francisco, California, where about 30 of its 200 employees work. Most of its staff work in its book-scanning centers. The Archive has data centers in three Californian cities, San Francisco, Redwood City, and Richmond. To prevent losing the data in case of e.g. a natural disaster, the Archive attempts to create copies of (parts of) the collection at more distant locations, currently including the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt and a facility in Amsterdam. The Archive is a member of the International Internet Preservation Consortium and was officially designated as a library by the State of California in 2007."

It is a division of the film production company, Lucasfilm, which Lucas founded, and was created when Lucas began production of the film Star Wars. For many years, particularly during the widespread inception of computer graphics in film during the 1980s, ILM was considered the leading industry standard production house for computer graphics in film; many studios other than Lucasfilm sent scenes to the studio for CG. It is also the original founder company of the animation studio Pixar. ILM originated in Van Nuys, California, then later moved to San Rafael in 1978, and since 2005 it has been based at the Letterman Digital Arts Center in the Presidio of San Francisco.

However, this does not mark the first introduction of the Infiniti brand to Japan, with the original Q45 being sold as the Nissan Infiniti Q45 in Japan from November 1989 until 1996. Infiniti models have direct equivalents in the Japanese domestic market Nissan lineup. The Infiniti G as the Nissan Skyline sedan and coupe and previously the Nissan Primera, Infiniti M as the Nissan Fuga and previously the Nissan Leopard, Infiniti EX as the Nissan Skyline crossover, and Infiniti Q45 as the Nissan Cima. The Infiniti FX has no Nissan equivalent and is not sold in Japan. The Skyline and Cima were luxury vehicles in Japan in earlier forms, and were originally exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called Nissan Prince Shop, then later called Nissan Red Stage until the Japanese dealership network was disbanded. In 2012, Infiniti moved its global headquarters from the Nissan corporate building in Yokohama and incorporated in Hong Kong as Infiniti Global Limited, with Carlos Ghosn intending for Infiniti to have a greater focus on the burgeoning luxury market in mainland China as it forecast the country to become the largest luxury car market. Johan de Nysschen was appointed to head the Infiniti division in 2012. De Nysschen left the company as of August 2014 to become CEO of Cadillac. Infiniti Chairman Andy Palmer assumed de Nysschen's responsibilities. Nissan appointed Roland Krüger as president of Infiniti after the chairman of the marque, Andy Palmer, resigned to join Aston Martin in September 2014. In mid-2013 Infiniti announced their Q30 Concept car would get its world premiere at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, a move which will see Infiniti start an aggressive strategy to extend the Infiniti brand into new premium segments. In 2013, Infiniti's model designation will change to the coupes and sedans starting with the letter Q (SUVs and crossovers will start with the letters QX) and a number reflecting the model's place in the brand lineup. For instance, the M sedan will become the Q70 while the G sedan will be replaced with the Q50; meanwhile, the QX56 will become the QX80 while the EX will become the QX50. With its QX60 crossover (formerly known as JX35) Infiniti began to produce vehicle outside Japan. In 2014, it is expected to start producing two models in Xiangyang, China, a plant operated by Nissan's joint venture with Dongfeng Motor. It is also expanding in Sunderland, England, to produce a new compact car named Q30 in 2015. Infiniti was a minor sponsor for the 'Where Are We Going, Dad?', or '爸爸去哪儿' in Chinese (Pinyin: Bàbaqùnǎ'er), a popular Chinese television series, in 2013. It was also a major sponsor for the second season of ' Where Are We Going, Dad? ' in 2014."

  "text" : "Irem (アイレム Airemu) is a Japanese video game console developer and publisher, and formerly a developer and manufacturer of arcade games as well. The company has its headquarters in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Irem is probably mostly known for three 1980s arcade games: Moon Patrol (1982; licensed to Williams Electronics in North America), the earliest beat 'em up, Kung-Fu Master (1984), and the scrolling shooter R-Type (1987). In recent years, Irem has greatly diminished its input for video game consoles and has instead focused its attention in developing video game softwares based on Pachinko machines. The full name of the company that currently uses the brand is Irem Software Engineering. It was founded in 1997 by its parent company Nanao for the purpose of taking over the development department of the original Irem Corporation that had left the video game industry in 1994 to concentrate itself on the rental and sales of coin-op electronics. Irem Corporation was founded in 1974 as IPM Co Ltd and still exists today under the name Apies. Irem has been a popular developer in Japan with games like Photoboy for the PC Engine and In the Hunt for the arcades, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2. Irem refocused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Its video game division was dissolved in April 2011 and many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating games."

  "text" : "ihug was New Zealand's third largest ISP (behind Xtra and TelstraClear), before it was bought, then absorbed by Vodafone New Zealand (the country's largest mobile phone operator). According to 2005 estimates, it had over 100,000 internet and phone subscribers. Before 2000 ihug was New Zealand's largest ISP but as other ISPs began offering flat rate services, some customers opted to transfer to those providers. ihug originally stood for Internet Home Users Group, even though the name was seldom used. It was also known as The Internet Group or 'TIG' in Australia. Ihug was sold to iiNet in 2003 before being sold to Vodafone in 2006 after interest from then Television New Zealand subsidiary THL and competitor Orcon. Its headquarters are in Auckland, New Zealand. The former CEO was Mark Rushworth, who became Manager of Marketing at Vodafone NZ. The company also ran a small subscription television service in Auckland for a short period. After Vodafone retired the ihug brand in April 2008, existing customers were moved to Vodafone's own internet services, although customers had the choice of retaining their email addresses."

  "text" : "In-N-Out Burger is a regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations primarily in the American Southwest and Pacific coast. Founded in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948 by Harry Snyder and his wife Esther Snyder. The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine, California and has slowly expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California, as well as into Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Oregon. The current owner is Lynsi Snyder, the Snyders' only grandchild. As the chain has expanded, it has opened several distribution centers in addition to its original Baldwin Park location. The new facilities, located in Lathrop, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Draper, Utah; and Dallas, Texas will provide for potential future expansion into other parts of the country. In-N-Out Burger has resisted franchising its operations or going public; one reason is the prospect of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth. The company's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies. For example, In-N-Out is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines – starting at US$9.25 per hour in California, as of August 2001. The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base, and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys."

  "text" : "ITV plc is a British media company that holds 13 of the 15 regional television licences that make up the ITV network, the oldest and largest commercial terrestrial television network in the United Kingdom. The network, which is branded ITV by ITV plc, has vied with the British Broadcasting Corporation's BBC One for the status of the UK's most watched channel since the 1950s (a crown it lost in 2005). The company was formed by a corporate takeover by Granada plc (the parent company of Granada Television) of Carlton Communications. Granada acquired a 68% controlling interest of the newly formed company whilst Carlton retained the 32% remaining shares. It began trading on 2 February 2004. This was the most recent stage in a long process of mergers between the original ITV regional franchises. It acquired the remaining 25% of the Breakfast franchise holder, GMTV, from The Walt Disney Company in 2009 and Channel Television from Yattendon Group plc in 2011. On 19 October 2015, ITV announced it would buy UTV for £100 million, with ownership transferring to ITV on 29 February 2016. ITV plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index."

  "text" : "International Computers Limited (ICL) was a large British computer hardware, computer software and computer services company that operated from 1968 until 2002. It was formed through a merger of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM) and Elliott Automation in 1968. The company's most successful product line was the ICL 2900 Series range of mainframe computers. In later years, ICL attempted to diversify its product line but the bulk of its profits always depended on the mainframe customer base. New ventures included marketing a range of powerful IBM clones made by Fujitsu, various minicomputer and personal computer ranges and (more successfully) a range of retail point-of-sale equipment and back-office software. Despite significant sales in overseas markets, ICL's mainframe base was dominated by large contracts from the UK public sector. Significant customers included Post Office Ltd, the Inland Revenue, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence. ICL also had a strong market share with UK local authorities and (at that time) nationalized utilities including the water, electricity, and gas boards. The company was eventually acquired by Fujitsu, and in April 2002 it was rebranded as Fujitsu."

Registered officially as a company in Sweden since September 27, 2001, Illwinter's products include three fantasy strategy games and an installer creation program for Linux. Illwinter's games are characterized by large amount of content, replaybility, support for multiple platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows included), good multiplay support and simple, perhaps even outdated, visual and sound effects. The games are said to have a steep learning curve and a somewhat lacking user interface. Labor division within the tiny team is simple: Kristoffer Osterman creates the units, spells and descriptions while Johan Karlsson makes everything else work. Both Johan Karlsson and Kristoffer Osterman have expressed their love for role-playing games, especially Ars Magica and roguelikes. Kristoffer Osterman teaches religion and social sciences as a primary occupation."

Inslaw's principal owners, William Anthony Hamilton and his wife, Nancy Burke Hamilton, later sued the United States Government for not complying with the terms of the Promis contract and for refusing to pay for an enhanced version of Promis once delivered. This allegation of software piracy led to three trials in separate federal courts and two congressional hearings. During the ensuing investigations, the Department of Justice was accused of deliberately attempting to drive Inslaw into Chapter 7 liquidation; and of distributing and selling stolen software for covert intelligence operations against foreign governments such as Canada, Israel, Singapore, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan."

  "text" : "iBiquity Digital Corporation is a company formed by the merger of USA Digital Radio and Lucent Digital Radio, with the goal of creating an in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital radio system for the United States and around the world. Based in Columbia, Maryland, with additional offices in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and Auburn Hills, Michigan, iBiquity is a privately held, intellectual properties company, whose investors include global leaders in the technology, broadcasting, manufacturing, media and financial industries. IBOC can operate on both AM band and FM band broadcasts either in a digital-only mode, or in a \"hybrid\" digital+analog mode. Most broadcasters for the foreseeable future will use the hybrid method, reportedly giving AM stations FM quality sound, while allowing FM stations to broadcast mp3 audio (~96kbps). The stations can split the MP3 bandwidth to carry multiple audio program streams (called HD2 or HD3 multicast channels) as well as show on-screen text data such as song title and artist, traffic and weather information. Nearly 2,000 stations in the US broadcast with this system. The technology is marketed under the trademark HD Radio. It is the only technology approved by the Federal Communications Commission for digital AM and FM broadcasting in the United States. Due in large part to its ability to deliver digital audio services while leveraging existing analog spectrum (by broadcasting digital information on the sidebands), commercial implementation of the technology is gaining momentum in various countries throughout the world, including Canada, Mexico and The Philippines. Testing and demonstrations of the system are also underway in China, Colombia, Germany, Indonesia, Jamaica, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, Thailand, and Ukraine, among other countries. According to iBiquity Digital, holder of the HD Radio trademark, the \"HD\" in \"HD Radio\" does not stand for \"High Definition\" or \"Hybrid Digital\". It is simply part of their trademark, and does not have any meaning on its own. The name \"HD Radio\" and logo were developed by Lexicon Branding. On September 2, 2015, iBiquity announced that DTS was purchasing them for $USD 172 million, bringing the HD Radio technology under the same banner as DTS' eponymous theater surround sound systems."

Vince Zampella, Grant Collier, and Jason West established Infinity Ward in 2002 after working at 2015, Inc. previously. All of the 22 original team members of Infinity Ward came from the team that had worked on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault while at 2015, Inc. Activision helped fund Infinity Ward in its early days, buying up 30 percent of the company. The studio's first game, World War II shooter Call of Duty, was released on the PC in 2003. The day after the game was released, Activision snapped up the rest of Infinity Ward, signing employees to long term contracts. Infinity Ward went on to make Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts and most recently announced Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Co-founder Collier left the company in early 2009 to join parent company Activision. In 2010, West and Zampella were fired by Activision for \"breaches of contract and insubordination\", they soon founded a game studio called Respawn Entertainment. On May 3, 2014, Neversoft was merged into Infinity Ward."

The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties can not be foreign-owned. The company operates a unique business model: instead of committing a large percentage of production for the next fashion season, the company commits a small amount and uses customer feedback and an efficient production network to replenish stores with new and different products weekly.

  "text" : "Intel Ireland's parent company – the giant U.S. based Intel microprocessor business – is a public company trading on the NASDAQ exchange. Intel decided in 1989 to build its European manufacturing operations in Leixlip, County Kildare, and formed Intel Ireland to be the holding company. The manufacturing plant manufactured its first chip in 1993. To base its European operations in Ireland, Intel received over IRE£87m in grants from IDA Ireland. Intel Ireland also operates a research facility (Intel Shannon) in Shannon, County Clare which employs approximately 250 people. Since 1989, Intel has invested $12.5 billion, turning 360 acres of the Collinstown Industrial Park into the most advanced industrial campus in Europe. Intel Ireland has approximately 4,500 employees working at its Leixlip campus and as it has been a major contributor to the performance of the Irish economy. Construction of the Fab 24 manufacturing plant in the 2000s signified its continuing commitment to developing its Irish operations. The Intel Ireland campus at Leixlip is Intel's largest manufacturing plant outside of the United States and consisted of two semi-conductor wafer fabrication facilities: Fab 10 Ireland Fab Operations (IFO), and also the Fab 24 manufacturing plant which includes Fab 24-2. IFO was a 200mm wafer facility whilst Fab 24 processes 300mm wafers using 65 nanometer and 90 nanometer process technologies. IFO ceased operations and fab 10 is now classed as fab 24 along with fab 14. The leixlip facility now only produces 300mm wafers using 14 nm technology. In April 2005 the operation announced that the one-billionth microchip had been manufactured by the Leixlip-based operation . By August 2010, Intel Fab Operations (IFO) had become the first Intel plant to ship 2 billion die. It is also notable as the only Intel facility to achieve the ISO 14001 safety standard for its management of the local environment Intel Ireland has been located in Leixlip,Co. Kildare since 1989. The company has invested over $7 billion transforming the 360 – acre former stud farm into a manufacturing centre. This site was chosen as it was ideal for the further expansion of the plant."

  "text" : "Impressions Games was a video game developer founded by David Lester in the UK. He sold the company to Sierra Entertainment in 1995, who was then bought out by Cendant and eventually, Vivendi Universal (now known as Vivendi SA). Impressions specialized in historical strategy games, and is most well known for its City Building Series, which include Caesar, Pharaoh, and Zeus: Master of Olympus. Mike Ryder, former president of Sierra Entertainment, forced a change in management in October 2001, during development of Lords of the Realm III. Rod Nakamoto was installed as the new director. Lords III became Impressions's final game, and was released to mediocre reviews in March 2004. The studio was shut down in April 2004 when Vivendi Universal closed most of their game development studios. Many members of the studio moved on to form Tilted Mill Entertainment. Former notable employees of Impressions include Chris Beatrice and Peter Haffenreffer, co-founders of Tilted Mill Entertainment and Simon Bradbury, founder of Firefly Studios."

It was founded in 1989 by David Blech, Isaac Blech, Robert Nowinski, and George Rathmann, a pioneer in the industry and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Amgen, Icos focused on the development of drugs to treat inflammatory disorders. During its 17-year history, the company conducted clinical trials of twelve drugs, three of which reached the last phase of clinical trials. Icos also manufactured antibodies for other biotechnology companies. Icos is famous for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was discovered by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phase III clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biopharmaceuticals, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees."

  "text" : "Investcorp is a Bahrain-based manager of alternative investment products, for private and institutional clients. Its principal client base is in the six countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council, but it also has institutional clients in North America and Europe. It has offices in New York City, Bahrain and London. The company offers investments in corporate investment, real estate and hedge funds, and has arranged investments with a combined value of approximately $44 billion. It typically places the private equity of companies and real estate properties it acquires directly with investors on a deal-by-deal basis, rather than through a fund structure. In addition, the firm operates the Gulf Opportunity Fund investing in the MENA region, and a number of technology funds. The company was founded in 1982 as a corporate and real estate investment firm, and diversified in 1997 into hedge funds. Non-Gulf investors, mainly in the US, now account for around two-thirds of Investcorp’s hedge fund client assets under management, with $1 billion in new US hedge fund mandates being secured in 2009. Investcorp currently has approximately $12 billion in invested assets under management across its three asset classes. In 2011, it ranked 67th in the PEI300 (Private Equity Index 300) ranking of private equity firms by assets deployed, with $4.68bn invested in private equity over the previous five years.(subscription required) The company maintains relationships with over 1,000 individual and institutional investors in the Gulf. The company is regulated in Bahrain as a wholesale bank, and has traditionally utilised long-term and medium-term bank financing, including private placements and syndicated loans, in order to ensure a longer maturity profile. The company’s capital adequacy ratio (Basel II) at 2012 year end was 22.9%. The company is listed on the Bahrain Bourse (BSE), with a financial year end of 30 June. Investcorp's portfolio company, Moneybookers, ended its relationship with Wikileaks in August 2010 as a direct result of U.S. government pressure."

  "text" : "Iron Lore Entertainment was a video game developer that was founded in October 2000 by Brian Sullivan and Paul Chieffo. In late June 2006, the company released Titan Quest, an action role-playing video game for publisher THQ. Titan Quest is set in ancient Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia and China, and makes use of the mythology of those civilizations. The company released an expansion pack, Titan Quest: Immortal Throne, in March 2007. Iron Lore received the New Studio award at the 7th annual Game Developers Choice Awards, recognizing outstanding achievement of a studio whose first title was released in 2006. It was announced in the October 2007 issue of Games for Windows Magazine that Iron Lore Entertainment was assisting with the development of the Relic Entertainment title Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War: Soulstorm, which was the third and final expansion for Dawn of War. It proved to be their last project. On February 27, 2008 it was announced that Iron Lore Entertainment had closed down owing to an inability to secure funding for its next project. Following the closure, former members of Iron Lore formed a new company called Crate Entertainment."

  "text" : "Ilmor, founded by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan in November 1983, is a British independent high-performance autosport engineering company. With manufacturing based in Brixworth, Northamptonshire, and maintenance offices in Plymouth, Michigan, the company supplies engines and consultancy to the IndyCar Series and MotoGP. After originally developing IndyCar engines, the company built a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to power F1 cars for both the Sauber and McLaren teams. After the death of Paul Morgan in a vintage aeroplane crash in 2001, Mercedes increased its stake until it owned the entire company, and renamed it Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd. In 2005, Mario Illien concluded a deal to purchase the Special Projects part of the company in partnership with Roger Penske, which was under contract with Honda Performance Development to jointly develop IndyCar engines from 2003-2006 (with the relationship continuing through 2011). This new company, which is totally independent of Mercedes, is once again known as Ilmor Engineering Ltd. They once again developed the Ilmor X3 for the 2007 MotoGP World Motorcycle Championship, which they entered in one race before withdrawing and effectively shutting down the race team, due to funding problems. Racing remains the core part of the business today and Ilmor acts as a consultant for motorsport clients from all forms of racing. However, the business is now using its racing expertise to diversify into other areas such as OEM automotive, defence, marine and energy efficient engine applications."

The company has played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It has worked with NASCAR to create new tracks and update older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators (though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR."

  "text" : "The International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) was established by the Government of Abu Dhabi pursuant to an Emiri Decree in 1984 with a mandate to invest globally in energy and energy related industries. The Government owns 100 per cent of IPIC and appoints all the members of its board of directors. Over its history, IPIC has been supported by equity contributions from the Government of Abu Dhabi. The Chairman of IPIC's board of directors is Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the UAE Minister of Presidential Affairs. The Managing Director of IPIC is Suhail al Mazrouei. IPIC is a long term strategic investor and it holds more than 18 investments in over 10 countries and on five different continents. Its investment portfolio includes: \n*  two wholly owned operating companies, being Nova Chemicals, a leading North American plastics and chemicals company based in Canada, and CEPSA, a leading Spanish integrated oil and petrochemicals company; \n*  two majority owned operating companies, being Borealis, one of the world's largest polyolefin producers and Aabar, a diversified investment company; and \n*  minority stakes in Cosmo Oil, a leading Japanese refining and marketing company and OMV, a leading Austrian integrated oil and gas company with a presence throughout Central and Eastern Europe. In addition, IPIC is undertaking the following strategic projects: \n* the multibillion-dollar ChemaWEyaat project at Madeenat ChemaWEyaat Al Gharbia, which is expected to comprise a series of world class petrochemicals complexes with access to Abu Dhabi's gas and liquid petroleum feedstocks. The first phase of this project is expected to be completed in 2015 and it is expected to be the world's largest single site petrochemicals facility, comprising an aromatics complex, including a naptha reformer, paraxylene and benzene units; \n* ADCOP, a 400 kilometre pipeline project which connects Abu Dhabi's key onshore oil fields to an export terminal located in the Emirate of Fujairah on the Indian Ocean (outside the Persian Gulf). The pipeline is intended to help mitigate the risk of a suspension of Abu Dhabi's crude oil exports in the event of a closure of, or a disruption to, the Strait of Hormuz and is expected to provide increased capacity in the export of Abu Dhabi's crude oil. The pipeline became operational in June 2012 with a capacity of 1.5 million barrels per day. IPIC intends to gradually raise the pipeline's capacity to 1.8 million barrels per day; \n*  the continuing expansion of the Borouge project (a joint venture in which IPIC's subsidiary Borealis has a 40.0 per cent. stake) to bring advanced technology and expertise into Abu Dhabi to strengthen and develop Abu Dhabi's industrial base and hydrocarbon and petrochemicals industries; \n*  the multibillion-dollar Fujairah Refinery project in the Emirate of Fujairah, which will process UAE crude oil, such as Murban and Upper Zakum; \n*  the Emirates Liquefied Natural Gas project (\"ELNG\"), a 50/50 joint venture with Mubadala Oil and Gas, a business unit of Mubadala, involving the development of a new LNG regasification facility on the UAE’s east coast in Fujairah; and \n*  the Duqm refinery and petrochemicals project (the \"Duqm Refinery\"), a 50/50 joint venture with Oman Oil Company S.A.O.C., involving the development of a new oil refinery situated on Oman’s east coast in Duqm."

  "text" : "Innis & Gunn is a brewing company based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Brewed in Glasgow at Wellpark (C&C Brewery), established in 2003 its beer has become the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. Since 2008, the business is family-owned, following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons. The beer was originally developed as a way of flavouring the barrels used by distiller William Grant for its ale cask reserve whisky. The original plan was for the beer to be discarded after it had flavoured the barrel, but the brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself. Innis & Gunn was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel. It was also an official corporate sponsor of the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2012. Innis & Gunn Original also featured at the 2013 Walt Disney World EPCOT International Food and Wine Festival at the inaugural Scotland booth."

  "text" : "The Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) was the administrator of British East Africa, which was the forerunner of the East Africa Protectorate, later Kenya. The IBEAC was a commercial association founded to develop African trade in the areas controlled by the British colonial power. Created after the Berlin Treaty of 1885, it was led by William Mackinnon and built upon his company's trading activities in the region, with the encouragement of the British government through the granting of an imperial charter - although it remained unclear what this actually meant. It granted immunity of prosecution to British subjects whilst allowing them the right to raise taxes, impose custom duties, administer justice, make treaties and otherwise act as the government of the area. Mombasa and its harbour were central to its operations, with an administrative office about 50 miles (80 km) south in Shimoni. The company was incorporated in London on 18 April 1888, and granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria on 6 September 1888. The IBEAC oversaw an area of about 246,800 square miles (639,000 km2) along the eastern coast of Africa, its centre being at about 39° East longitude and 0° latitude, and from 1890 also administered Uganda. The administration of British East Africa was transferred to the Foreign Office on 1 July 1895, and in 1896 so was control of Uganda."

A third studio, 2K Marin, was split off from Irrational in 2007, with five former Irrational Games employees leaving to join the new company. 2K Marin and 2K Australia would later work together on BioShock 2, while Irrational was developing BioShock Infinite.

The company was established by Navistar in 2002 through a reorganization of its subsidiary bus manufacturer American Transportation Corporation (AmTran). Through AmTran, IC traces its roots back to the 1933 founding of Ward Body Works in Conway, Arkansas. The IC company name stands for Integrated Coach (originally Integrated Chassis), alluding to how the vehicles are nearly completely assembled under a single corporate structure. For all IC vehicles, Navistar produces the bus body, chassis, and engine. Currently, all IC Bus vehicles are produced at its manufacturing facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma; since 2010, the former AmTran/Ward manufacturing facility in Conway, Arkansas has remained in use for fabrication and the production of parts."

Today, it is jointly owned by some of the world's largest oil companies and is headquartered in London, England. In June 1972, the Ba'athist government in Iraq nationalised the IPC and its operations were taken over by the Iraq National Oil Company. The company \"Iraq Petroleum Company\" still remains extant, however, on paper and one associated company – the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company (ADPC, formerly Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd) – also continues with its original shareholding intact. The related Iraq Petroleum Group was an association of companies that played a major role in the discovery and development of oil resources in areas of the Middle East outside Iraq."

  "text" : "iParty was a chain of more than 52 retail stores in New England and the Tampa Bay Area of Florida that specialized in selling party-related merchandise, as well as seasonal items such as Halloween costumes, Christmas garland, and Easter baskets during the appropriate time of year. In total, the number of different products that iParty sold throughout its stores was over 20,000. The chain, started in 1998 by husband and wife team Sal Perisano and Dorice Dionne, employed more than 1,000 people in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Florida. In March 2013, iParty announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Party City in a deal worth around $38 million in total. The company cited financial issues stemming from the effects of Hurricane Sandy in late-2012 (which disrupted the Halloween season) as a motive for the decision to explore strategic alternatives. iParty's stores were re-branded under the Party City brand."

  "text" : "ITV News is the branding of news programmes on the British television network ITV. ITV has a long tradition of television news. Independent Television News (ITN) was founded to provide news bulletins for the network in 1955, and has since continued to produce all news programmes on ITV. The channel's news coverage has won awards from the Royal Television Society, Emmy Awards and BAFTAs. Between 2004 and 2008, the ITV Evening News held the title of \"RTS News Programme of the Year\". The flagship ITV News at Ten has won numerous BAFTA awards, and also being named \"RTS News Programme of the Year\" in 2011 and 2015. ITV News has the second-largest television news audience in the United Kingdom, second only to BBC News (and followed by other broadcasters such as Sky News, Channel 4 News and 5 News). However, its £43 million annual news budget is dwarfed by that of the publicly funded BBC, which spends £89.5 million annually on news-gathering, plus a further £23.1 million on its rolling news channel. Initially, all national news programmes on ITV carried ITN's own brand. As the ITV network consolidated from the mid 1990s onwards, ITN branding of news programmes was eventually dropped in 1999 following the introduction of the ITV News brand. ITN remains the producer of all the national ITV News programmes."

  "text" : "Invest In Canada is the Government of Canada organization that promotes and attracts foreign direct investment into Canada. As a bureau in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada, Invest In Canada assists companies planning to invest in Canada or to expand their Canadian operations. The department was created in 1985 by the Investment Canada Act. Recent practice by the Harper government has been to limit foreign investment to no more than 50% share, a policy designed by Nigel S. Wright during his time at the PMO, although that was thrown out the window prior to the Oliver budget of April 2015 with the sale of a 50.1% share in the Canadian Wheat Board. Foreign direct investment (FDI) by country and by industry are tracked by Statistics Canada; the total in 2012 of FDI was CAD$634bn. New FDI inflow to Canada in 2011 was CAD$40.8bn. Canada was host to CAD$33bn in state-owned enterprise investment over the period between 2005 and 2012. Over the same period, the net FDI increased by CAD$236.1bn, so that SOE FDI was almost 14% of the total. Conversely, Canadian SOEs limit themselves to domestic affairs. The SOE of Canada are not aggressive in this manner: Canadian SOEs have no foreign investments. The Canadian government is planning to raise to CAD$1bn the amount of foreign money that can go into a Canadian company before the investment is reviewed. As of 2012, an investment or takeover of a Canadian business by a WTO investor worth CAD$330mn or more triggers a federal review under the Investment Canada Act. The WTO was implemented in Canada by the World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act in 1994. Industry Canada provides a helpful webpage with this information, and explains that WTO members are eligible for CAD$344mn review-free investment as of 12 January 2013. The WTO maintains a membership list. The information on the WTO \"amount\" permitted by discretion of the Minister of Industry under subsection 14.1(2) of the Investment Canada Act is published annually in January in the Canada Gazette. The government investigates whether the investment is of \"net benefit\" to Canada, which brings into play a nebulous political definition. Amounts inferior to this limit do not incur political oversight under the Investment Canada Act, so that the foreign investor is treated like any other Canadian investor. This means effectively, that Canada is open to reverse takeover by stealth. Prime Minister Harper clarified this FDI policy area in Toronto on 7 November 2013 when he said that a little wiggle room was needed on foreign takeover rules."

Inotera provides commodity DRAM memory foundry services on 300mm silicon wafers for its customers, Micron and Nanya Technology. All of Inotera’s manufacturing capacity is reserved for these two customers on an equal basis. The Company has reached full conversion to 70 nm shrink technology at the end of June 2008 and started pilot production of Micron’s 50 nm stack process technology from the third quarter of 2009 in order to further improve the productivity and to reduce manufacturing unit cost. Its total capacity of 130 thousand wafer starts per month is expected to be converted into 50 nm stack technology by the end of 2010 with DDR3 products making up the majority of the production. Inotera’s main products are currently the 512Mb DDR, 512Mb DDR2, 1Gb DDR2 and 1Gb DDR3 products featuring high density, high speed, and low power consumption."

  "text" : "The International Sport Karate Association (ISKA) is one of the major international bodies regulating sport karate and kickboxing matches, and is based in the United States. It was established in 1985 as a response to legal and revenue issues that sent the Professional Karate Association (PKA) into decline. From 1974 until 1985, the PKA had been the most recognised worldwide kickboxing sanctioning group. It was instrumental in establishing public relay of the sport via ESPN, helping to introduce the burgeoning sport to a wider audience, and had also developed the first fighter's ratings systems. Five major U.S.-based promoters and resigning PKA executives created the new body, the International Sport Karate Association (ISKA), with an official announcement on July 16, 1986. The first U.S. directors were Mike Sawyer, Karyn Turner, Tony Thompson, John Worley and Scott Coker. It currently runs the biggest martial arts tournament in the world, The U.S Open. Thousands of competitors from around the world participate every year. Many of the major PKA promoters began sanctioning their events with the ISKA and several also joined its administration. ISKA also secured ESPN broadcasts of its major title bouts in 1986, thus helping bring quick credibility and recognition to the new association. Since the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations (WAKO) was mostly active in Europe and the World Kickboxing Association (WKA) in Asia, ISKA was quick to expand through its own European Directors starting October 1986 with Olivier Muller, Jérome Canabate and Mohamed Hosseini. American Richard Mayor oversaw the establishment of this European wing as European President between 1986 and 1988. By 1991, the worldwide control of the ISKA was shared by two co-chairmen: Mike Sawyer and Olivier Muller. International TV coverage was secured, and united separate organisations were formed worldwide to handle responsibility for international sanctioning and grading. ISKA has conducted its official activities under ISKA ASIA since 2008 with Dr. S. A. Moinshirazi the President of ISKA ASIA. Paul Zadro is the President of ISKA Australia, which is the biggest martial arts tournament circuit in Australia."

  "text" : "Isaly’s was a chain of family-owned dairies and restaurants started in Mansfield (Richland County), Ohio with locations throughout the American Midwest from the early 20th century until the 1970s. It is known today for its iconic chipped chopped ham and for creating the famous Klondike Bar ice cream treat, popularized by the slogan \"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\". The company was founded by William Isaly, son of Swiss immigrants who settled in Monroe County, Ohio in the 19th century. By the early 1960s, the company boasted retail outlets that stretched from Pennsylvania to Iowa. Isaly’s early success was attributed to its loose company structure, which allowed for easy expansion without corporate overhead. William Isaly’s first dairy was established in Mansfield, Ohio where he acquired the Mansfield Pure Milk Company. Isaly expanded the core business from processing milk for sale to other grocers, to operating his own retail stores with milk, ice cream, bread and lunch counter service. Isaly also pioneered the idea of the modern convenience store by opening at least one outlet that also sold gasoline to motorists. The first expansion of the business took the company to Marion, Ohio after acquiring the Marion Pure Milk Company in 1914. Operated by Charles Isaly, the Marion operation was quickly modernized, and business grew accordingly. From Marion, the company expanded to Youngstown, Ohio and then Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (on the Blvd. of the Allies). Expansion continued through the 1930s and 1940s with additional dairies built from Columbus, Ohio (at North High Street and Arcadia Avenue) west to Iowa. Pittsburgh residents so highly regarded Isaly's that the company was considered a Pittsburgh original. In its advertising, the dairies used the mnemonic phrase \"I Shall Always Love You Sweetheart\" to help with the spelling of the Isaly’s name. In Marion, Ohio, Isaly’s fielded an amateur basketball team that played against the Marion, Ohio based  Jim Thorpe and His World-Famous Indians and the Buffalo Silents - a team composed of deaf/mute players. In the 1930s, Isaly’s began a commercial building program that employed high style art deco / Art Moderne designed production facilities and retail outlets, most of which were designed by architect Vincent (Shooey) Schoeneman. The Youngstown dairy facility represented the apex of this project, with the streamline building (with exterior by architect Charles F. Owsley) dominated by a five-story glass block tower. In addition to the Klondike Bar, the dairies were also known for their unique Skyscraper Cones, which eschewed round ice cream scoops, instead using a patented design that resulted in a long, inverse cone shaped dip. The company also had great success in selling chipped chopped ham, sliced (shaved) razor thin for sandwiches. The sandwich was featured on the PBS special Sandwiches That You Will Like. The company also marketed \"immunized milk for infants, supplied by special isolated herds of cattle.\" Shifting consumer demands, declining sales for home-delivered milk, as well as corporate consolidation led to the closing of Isaly facilities beginning in the 1960s. According to Brian Butko, author of Klondikes, Chipped Ham, & Skyscraper Cones: The Story of Isaly's, it was the loose company structure – in an era of growing corporate homogeneity - that left Isaly’s unable to compete on the wholesale and retail levels, leading to the closure of its dairies beginning in the mid-1960s. Several members of the Isaly family attempted to continue to operate food-service operations. In Pittsburgh, Isaly outlets were converted to the \"Sweet William\" brand. In Ohio, restaurants operated under the \"Isaly Shoppe\" name until the mid-1990s when the final outlet closed in Marion, Ohio. Since 1984, the Isaly's name has enjoyed a comeback of sorts, but one not overseen by members of the Isaly family. Delicatessen Distributing Incorporated of Evans City, Pennsylvania purchased the Isaly trademark name and markets the original quality luncheon meats, cheeses and sauces under the Isaly name in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. The concern also distributes Isaly brand ice cream (except Klondikes) to stores in Western Pennsylvania. The Klondike Bar product line is now owned by Unilever. There are at least three Isaly's still in operation in southwestern Pennsylvania in the areas of West View, Turtle Creek, and East Allegheny (city neighborhood of Pittsburgh), all retaining most of the classic interior. In June 2012, ownership of the West View Isaly's changed hands. The new owners have kept everything in the store intact but slightly changed the name to \"I Shall Always Love You Sweetie\", reflecting on Isaly's acronym. To punctuate this, periods have been added after each letter in the classic Isaly's storefront. A former Isaly's franchise in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, which operated under the name \"Bricker's Restaurant\" after its Isaly's contract ended and continued to serve much of the Isaly's menu, closed in 2012."

  "text" : "Intertrust Technologies Corporation is a software technology company specializing in trusted distributed computing. Intertrust's technologies in the realm of digital trust, data privacy, internet security and content protection include Seacert, whiteCryption, ExpressPlay, Personagraph and Genecloud. It is also a strategic investor in several startup companies. Much of Intertrust's DRM related work is based on the open standard Marlin DRM, which Intertrust founded along with four consumer electronics companies: Sony, Panasonic, Philips, and Samsung. Intertrust invents, develops, and licenses software, technologies and intellectual property for digital rights management (DRM) and trusted computing (TC). The company holds over 150 patents and has over 300 patent applications pending worldwide. Intertrust's inventions enable many products that use DRM and trusted computing technologies, including operating systems, digital media platforms, consumer electronics and mobile computing devices, web services, and secure enterprise automation. Through its wholly owned subsidiary Seacert, Intertrust provides trust management services for the Marlin and OMA DRM standards. Intertrust provides Marlin DRM server and client SDKs to support servers or clients. Supported clients include set-top boxes, Internet TV's, personal computers, mobile phones, and other service-enabled devices. Intertrust is headquartered in Silicon Valley and has regional offices in London and Beijing. Intertrust was founded in 1990 by inventor-entrepreneur Victor Shear. Shear's vision was to revolutionize electronic commerce by creating technologies that allowed independent actors to establish trust between each other when using digital networks and devices. Shear, a sociologist by training, brought concepts from human behavior, community construction, commerce and economics to life in the digital world in a unique and innovative way. The concepts that Intertrust has developed over the years cross disciplines and impact everything requiring trusted transactions, from healthcare, enterprise computing to entertainment and consumer electronics.

  "text" : "Intelligent Finance (IF) is a Scottish offset bank, a division of Bank of Scotland plc which is part of Lloyds Banking Group. It was established as a division of Halifax plc in 1999 by Jim Spowart, who helped establish other direct financial services firms including Direct Line. Following a reorganisation of the HBOS group, it is now a division of Bank of Scotland plc. IF's registered headquarters are in Edinburgh, with customer service operations based in Scotland (Livingston, West Lothian, and Rosyth, Fife. It operates throughout the United Kingdom. IF was set up at a time when many banks were exploring opportunities to utilise new technology to reduce the costs of providing financial services. IF established what it marketed as \"intelligent\" products whereby customer pick a combination of all or some of a range of bank accounts including current account, savings account, mortgage and credit card. The credit balance in a person's current account and saving accounts would \"offset\" any debit balances in the person's mortgage and credit card accounts. The customer would then pay interest on the net balance, potentially allowing savings to be made on borrowings. However, in June 2005 IF withdrew its offset credit card, citing high running costs. Although the bank was hit by technical problems at its launch, it quickly gained a significant market share in the mortgage and current account market, and is still one of the largest in the U.K Intelligent Finance sponsored the Scottish First Division football team Livingston FC. From 2006 to 2008 it sponsored the if.comedies award, successor to the Perrier Comedy Award, at the Edinburgh Fringe. In July 2009, Intelligent Finance withdrew its mortgage and current account products to new customers, although existing customers were unaffected. In March 2013, Intelligent Finance withdrew all its remaining products to new customers. As with mortgages, existing customers continued to be able to operate their accounts. In Summer 2014, Intelligent Finance asked its savings customers to consider moving their accounts to TSB Bank. Lloyds Banking Group was asked to close Intelligent Finance to new business by the European Commission in order to reduce their market share."

The name of the company's principal ferry, the Scillonian III, is perhaps better known than that of the company itself. The company is based in the Isles of Scilly Travel Centre Penzance. It also owns Isles of Scilly Skybus Ltd, an operator of fixed-wing aircraft services to the Isles of Scilly, and sight seeing flights. In 2010, the company had close to 1,000 shareholders, around half of whom live on the Isles of Scilly. Due to the Isles of Scilly's remote location, the shipping service is often called 'a life line' for the archipelago. In addition to passengers, 12,000 to 14,000 tonnes of cargo are normally carried by Scillonian III and Gry Maritha every year."

  "text" : "Ice Harbor Brewing Company is a brewery founded in Pasco, Washington in 1996 by two former workers at the Hanford Site. They entered this venture after buying the Meheen & Collins brewery. The brewery is located in what was once a grain mill at 206 N. Benton St. in Kennewick, Washington. This building serves as a brewery, and as a brewpub. The menu offers sandwiches and various fare as well as the brewery's creations. The brewpub recently installed a beer engine, which allows the beer to be pulled from the cask, rather than pushed by carbon dioxide gas. The brewpub is believed to be the only Tri-City brewpub that uses such a device. Recently, Ice Harbor Brewing had opened its second pub, which is located at the Port of Kennewick's commercial building at 350 Clover Island Dr. on Clover Island in Kennewick. The pub opened in late October 2007, and features much of the same brews and fare at the Railroad Avenue brewpub, but without the homebrewing inventory."

It was a Palo Alto laboratory and technology incubator focusing on consumer product applications and services with a focus on the Internet. A 1997 version of the company's web page described itself as \"a research setting seeking to define the issues, map out the concepts and create the technology that will be important in the future.... [pursuing] basic innovations in a number of early-stage technologies and [seeking] to foster industries around them -- sparking opportunity for entrepreneurs and highlighting a new approach to research.\". A 1999 Wired magazine article based on a memo from Paul Allen described the company as under fire from Allen to produce \"less R and more D.\" Interval Research Corporation officially closed its doors in April 2000, while a small group of former employees were kept on to form Interval Media to continue a few specific projects. Interval Media was closed in June, 2006. As of June 2008, the interval.com domain registration was maintained by Digeo, another Paul Allen company."

  "text" : "The International Navigation Company (INC) was a Philadelphia based holding company owning 26 ships totaling 181,000 tons and carried more passengers than either Cunard or White Star, when the company was reorganized as International Mercantile Marine in 1902. INC was formed in 1871 with the backing of the Pennsylvania Railroad to operate foreign flagged vessels on transatlantic routes to Philadelphia. Clement Griscom, the company’s general manager, entered into an agreement with the Belgian Government to establish the Red Star Line to operate a mail service out of Antwerp to Philadelphia and New York. This subsidiary would provide most of the company’s profits for the next 30 years. In 1873, Griscom also took over the management of the American Steamship Company, a Philadelphia based passenger and cargo service to Liverpool that was also backed by the Pennsylvania Railroad. This company, known as the American “Keystone” Line was unprofitable because of the substantially higher costs associated with operating American-flagged vessels. In 1884, the assets of the American Line were acquired by International Navigation. Two years later, INC also acquired the assets of the financially troubled Inman Line, operator of a British flagged Liverpool-New York mail service. With PRR’s backing, Griscom ordered two record breakers to restore Inman’s fortunes. However, the British Government objected to Inman’s ownership change and revoked Imman’s mail contract. Griscom successfully lobbied Congress to reflag the two new express liners and qualify for an American mail subsidy. In 1893, Inman was merged the American Line and the company built two additional express liners in the US to create a premium weekly service, now routed to Southampton. Griscom believed that the major lines should be merged to control capacity and avoid rate wars. In 1899, he became acquainted with J. P. Morgan, an investment banker who was responsible for many of the large mergers during the period. With financing from Morgan’s syndicate, in 1902 Griscom and Morgan expanded International Navigation by acquiring the Atlantic Transport Line, the Leyland Line, the White Star Line, the Dominion Line and half of Holland America. International Navigation was renamed International Mercantile Marine (IMM). However, Griscom and Morgan paid too high a price for the companies they acquired and IMM struggled under the debt payments. Management was reorganized to focus on White Star, the most profitable subsidiary. In 1915, IMM was forced into bankruptcy when the war disrupted cash flow, but later was able to profit from the wartime demand for shipping. In the 1920s and 1930s, IMM gradually sold off its foreign subsidiaries. In 1931, it acquired the United States Lines, and merged all operations under that name in 1943. The company failed in 1986 and was liquidated when it over expanded in the cargo container business."

Interislander was started in August 1962 by KiwiRail's predecessor, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR). The service primarily provided a RORO rail link between its North and South Island networks, allowing NZR to compete directly with coastal shipping companies for inter-island freight. It also provided the first RORO road link between the two islands, which saw the Interislander compete with, and then completely replace, the Union Company's Wellington–Lyttelton ferry service. Today, the service is still well patronised despite competition on the Wellington–Picton sea route with Bluebridge and from airlines, carrying around one million passengers and 230,000 vehicles per year on 5,500 sailings."

Before then, it was a printed periodical called Visionary Darkness. Free copies of Visionary Darkness were distributed in local high schools and record shops. It later became a web site on Geocities which housed a variety of humorous articles and rants. Barr also registered other sites on GeoCities under several aliases and made them all a part of the Visionary Darkness web site. After a few years of building up the popularity of these sites, Barr registered the I-Mockery.com domain name in August 1999 to house all of his humor sites under the same roof (and to avoid GeoCities' increasingly slow performance). The I-Mockery name was created as a spoof of all the corporate web sites that started with \"I\" or \"E\" at the time. The name loosely translates to Internet-Mockery. Over the years the site has expanded greatly, but still continues to live up to its original slogan: \"Dedicated to making a mockery out of all things adored by the general public. Dedicated to exposing people who take themselves far too seriously. Dedicated to giving due credit to works of genius that have never enjoyed the spotlight.\""

  "text" : "Instaphone was brand name of first ever cellular mobile communication services launched by M/s Pakcom Ltd., a telecommunications company in Pakistan and the pioneer of cellular industry in Pakistan. The company was jointly owned by M/s Arfeen and Millicom International (Luxemberg)and was acquired later by the Arfeen Group.In 1989, the Government of Pakistan awarded licences to cellular mobile operators. M/s Pakcom Ltd. and M/s Paktel Ltd. won the bids and were granted licences for 15 years. A third company ( M/s Pakistan mobile Telecommunication ltd) was also among the competitors however could not complete technical/financial proposal in time and had to stay away from competition for some times ( least they brought GSM system, an advanced digital system in 1994 with famous brand name of Mobilink.)The two companies raced to launch their cellular service and \"Instaphone\" won the race by few weeks, when they commercially launched their operation on 16 October 1990 with 3 Radio Base Stations located at WTC ( Khyaban e Jami, Clifton), PNSC building roof top, and at Pak Capitol exchange ( a PTCL exchange at University road, Karachi). The Cellular mobile exchange was located at penthouse on WTC building tower 1.This building is owned by M/s Arfeen, the partner in M/s Pakcom. Later next month the services were started in Islamabad with exchange and a radio base station at Blue area, a RBS at Daman-e-Koh, and one at State life building in Sadder, Rawalpindi. The CME (cellular mobile exchange of both operators was from Ericsson (Sweden) model AXE-10. Services at Peshawar were started in April 1991 with RBS at roof top of State life building,Sadder, Peshawar cant, and later at Quetta with RBS at PTCL exchange at Mall road and at Brewery road.The Quetta was satellite of Karachi exchange linked via PTCL network, and Peshawar was satellite of Islamabad exchange again linked via PTCL network. The nature of billing was post paid with Rs.5000/- as initial deposit, the Call data was stored on magnetic tapes, sent to UK for printing of bills and bills were then sent to the customers for settling their bills, hence the turn around time was in excess of 45 days. This resulted in non payments from many defaulters who fled away after using and making heavy bills. The call rate was Rs.4/- per minute for local calls charged to both (caller and responder). Such unpaid billing was Rs. 25 Million approx in June 1993.f The company's license was cancelled by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority in January 2008 for unpaid fees."

  "text" : "Integral Energy is the second largest state-owned energy corporation in New South Wales, incorporated under the Energy Services Corporations Act 1995 from a merger between Prospect Electricity and Illawarra Electricity. Integral Energy is involved in electricity retail in addition to owning an electricity distribution network and currently holds licences to retail electricity in the contestable markets covered by the NEM (National Electricity Market). Integral Energy distributes and retails electricity and services to 807,000 customers, or 2.1 million people. The company is increasingly operating outside of New South Wales, with the introduction of full retail contestability in other states. In addition to electricity retailing, Integral Energy also owns an electricity distribution network spanning 24,500 square kilometres in Greater Western Sydney, the Illawarra, and the Southern Highlands. Their network value is estimated at A$2 billion and is made up of 25,000 transmission, zone and distribution substations, 370,000 power poles and 150,000 streetlights bound together by 33,000 kilometres of underground and overground cables. Integral Energy does not have a monopoly on the sale of energy within its distribution area and is in competition with private sector retailers such as AGL and Origin Energy since the introduction of full retail contestability in New South Wales. The current CEO is Vince Graham (formerly of Railcorp), who replaced Richard Powis on 7 April 2008. Fifteen Integral Energy field service centres operate within their franchise, with staff to maintain the network, repair faults, respond to emergencies and service customers and developers in relation to customer connection and contestable projects. The centres are located in Bowenfels, Glendenning, Hoxton Park, Kandos, Katoomba, Moss Vale, Narellan, Nowra, Parramatta, Penrith, Picton, Shellharbour, Springhill, Ulladulla and South Windsor."

  "text" : "IZZE Beverage Company is the name of the company that produces the Izze line of fruit-derived carbonated soft drinks commonly sold at Starbucks and other coffee shops, Chipotle, Whole Foods, Target, Costco, other health food and grocery stores. IZZE is made of 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water. The company was founded in Boulder, Colorado by Todd Woloson and Greg Stroh in 2002. Izze has founded the charity program Project Reach. This program helps give more educational opportunities to families of the farmers that sell their fruit to Izze. On September 26, 2006, IZZE Beverage Co was purchased by PepsiCo. PepsiCo has announced that it plans to leave IZZE as is, only assisting with marketing efforts. The IZZE Beverage Co introduced its second line of beverages, IZZE-esque, on March 9, 2007. IZZE-esque is reminiscent of the original IZZE but contains approximately 60 calories per serving versus the 90-120 per serving in original IZZE and contains 25% fruit juice versus 70%. The name IZZE was chosen because the creator's daughter is named Isabel and \"Izze\" is her nickname."

Indra's portfolio ranges from consultancy, project development, and systems and applications integration to outsourcing of IT systems and business processes.

By geographical areas, Europe and the United States are the two international markets with the greatest weight and growth for Indra. Latin America is also a geographical area in which Indra is operating. The following are among Indra's main business areas: \n*  Air traffic control systems – where it is one of the world's largest suppliers; Indra claims that a third of the world's air traffic is managed by systems developed by the company \n*  Ticketing systems developed for underground railway systems – such as those in Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Lisbon, Shanghai, Athens, Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile \n*  Financial services \n*  Energy \n*  Electoral technology and processes \n*  Aircraft simulators \n*  Defense \n*  Health information systems"

The site provides a safe and health-focused location for injection drug use, primarily heroin. The clinic does not supply any drugs. Medical staff are present to provide addiction treatment, mental health assistance, and first aid in the event of an overdose or wound. In 2009, the site recorded 276,178 visits (an average of 702 visits per day) by 5,447 unique users; 484 overdoses occurred with no fatalities, due to intervention by medical staff. Health Canada has provided $500,000 per year to operate the site, and the BC Ministry of Health contributed $1,200,000 to renovate the site and cover operating costs. Insite also serves as a resource for those seeking to use a harm reduction approach for people who inject drugs around the world. In recent years, delegations from a number of countries are on record touring the facility, including Colombia and Brazil."

  "text" : "Innovation Publishing (also known as Innovation Books) was an American comic book company based in Wheeling, West Virginia. It was co-founded by David Campiti in 1988 after writing a business proposal and raising US$400,000 to finance its launch. Innovation became #4 in market share, below Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and Dark Horse Comics. The company published many adaptations and tie-in series of existing media properties, such as Anne Rice's novels Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned. It also published Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality: On a Pale Horse; the TV series Dark Shadows, Quantum Leap, Beauty and the Beast and Lost in Space; and the movie series Child's Play, A Nightmare on Elm Street among others. Innovation's original series included Angel Heat; Dangerous Secrets; Dream Angel; The Experimentals; writer Al Rio's Exposure; Galaxy Girl; Greylore; writer Kevin Juaire's Hero Alliance; Legends of the Stargrazers; and writer Mike Barr's The Maze Agency (continuing a series originally published by Comico). Innovation was one of the first companies to delve heavily into recruiting talents from Brazil, starting the American careers of Mike Deodato and Joe Bennett, among others. 1992 Russ Manning \"Best Newcomer\" Award-winner Mike Okamoto broke into comic books illustrating The Maze Agency #15 (Aug. 1990) and Hero Alliance #11-12 (Nov.-Dec. 1990). Campiti left Innovation in 1993 to launch Glasshouse Graphics, a studio/agency for illustrators, writers, painters, and digital designers.Shortly thereafter, in early 1994, Innovation closed, leaving substantial debts to creators, printers, and investors."

  "text" : "Igloo Products Corporation is a manufacturer of ice chests. The company's headquarters are in unincorporated Waller County, Texas, United States, west of the city of Katy. Igloo, originally a metal working shop, began in 1947. In early 1960 Igloo merged with the Production Tooling Company, and the company name changed to Texas Tennessee Industries (TTI). The company's marketing arm was the John T. Everett Company, a company from Memphis, Tennessee. By 1971 Texas Tennessee Industries, Inc. was planning to change its name to Igloo. Started in 1947 as a small metalworking shop that made metal water coolers for blue collar workers, Igloo Products is now a leading ice chest and beverage dispenser manufacturer, perhaps known best for its Playmate brand. The company's first all-plastic ice chest was introduced in 1962. Igloo makes the coolers for personal and industrial use and claims that nearly three in every four US households owns an Igloo cooler. The company's more than 500 products (including personal, beverage, and full-sized coolers) are sold through more than 250 retailers in the US and abroad. Private investment firm Westar Capital purchased Igloo from Brunswick in 2001. J.H. Whitney & Company became the new majority owner in 2008. In March 2014, ACON, a Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm, purchased Igloo from J.H. Whitney, which will maintain a small stake in the Company."

  "text" : "Imagine Homes Ltd was at one point one of the largest purchasers of residential property in the United Kingdom. Founded by CEO Grant Bovey in 2003, Imagine Homes began operating from offices in Kew, Surrey, with a total of four employees. In 2007, Imagine Homes achieved substantial growth, with headquarters located in Farnborough, Hampshire, offices in Canary Wharf, Dubai, Singapore and Dublin, and employing over 80 staff worldwide. Imagine Homes operated in the UK buy-to-let industry, working with established property developers to offer off-plan investment opportunities throughout the United Kingdom, i.e. they would buy properties from developers, fit them out, then market them to investors as \"buy-to-let\" properties. The company's tag line was \"The simple way to profit from property\". In 2008, Imagine Homes planned to open the UK’s first buy-to-let showroom on the Hogarth Roundabout, Chiswick, London. Grant Bovey's company rode the rise in property prices in the UK and internationally, and rode the fall in property prices until Bovey lost control in early 2009 after being personally wiped out. In September 2007 the Daily Telegraph reported that a proposed IPO by Imagine Homes had been abandoned. Instead the business was recapitalised by a £37.5 m equity-and-debt injection from HBOS. The flotation plans were put back until 2009 at the earliest. The decision to pull the flotation was caused by: \n*  Significant softening in the business’s main market, the sale and rental of new build residential property. The business model of Imagine Homes depended on “Buy to Let” investors feeling confident enough in price rises to buy property with the expectation of rising property prices and rent high enough to cover their costs.  \n*  The correction of a prior year accounting errors in the company’s report and accounts which had resulted in the overstatement of revenues. After correction of the error, the reported losses before tax had more than doubled to £6.42m in the year to March 2007 compared to £2.81m for the previous year. \n*  Weakening equity markets would not have helped the flotation of an investment prospect linked to the property market. HBOS, as part of their refinancing, asked for improved Corporate Governance within Imagine Homes. They recruited two non-executive directors to the board. On 23 February 2009, The Daily Mail reported that HBOS had taken over the company, and that Bovey and his wife Anthea Turner had been forced to put their Surrey mansion up for sale. The article quoted them as saying that they had been substantially wiped out and that only a small fraction of their net worth remained. The Daily Mail also reported that Anthea Turner is doing television commercials for household detergents to make ends meet, as well as a satellite show about ridding your home of pests. Imagine Homes Limited was placed in administration in May 2009."

  "text" : "The Iraq National Oil Company (INOC) was founded in 1966 by the Iraqi government. It was empowered to operate all aspects of the oil industry in Iraq except for refining which was already being run by the Oil Refineries Administration (1952) and local distribution which was also already under government control. In 1961 Iraq passed Public Law 80 whereby Iraq expropriated 95% of the Iraq Petroleum Company's concessions, and went on to announce the intent to form the INOC in 1964. In 1967 Iraq and the Soviet Union signed the Iraq-Soviet Protocol which committed the Soviet Union to give technical and financial aid to the company. In 1967 and 1968 the company's purview was expanded to include areas expropriated from the Iraq Petroleum Company. Unlike the National Iranian Oil Company, the INOC was forbidden from entering into partnerships or granting concessions to foreign oil companies. Though there was discussion of allowing the French Compagnie Française de Pétroles, partners in IPC from whom the North Rumaila Field had been appropriated, to enter into a contract to develop the field, ultimately, with the help of the Soviet Union, the INOC opened the field on 7 April 1972. In 1972 nationalization was complete. In its first years of sole control INOC managers succeeded in raising production in Iraq from 1.4 million barrels per day (220,000 m3/d) to over 3 million barrels per day (480,000 m3/d) in 1980. But the outbreak of war with Iran that year severely hit capacity. In April 1987, under newly appointed oil President Asfhaq ul Rasheed, Decree 267 merged the INOC with the oil ministry, which became the direct operator in the industry as well as its regulator. At an operational level, the single national-level company was broken into a series of regional companies, the largest among them being North Oil Company, based in Kirkuk, and South Oil Company, based in Basra."

  "text" : "Ideal Jawa (India) Ltd was an Indian motorcycle company based in Mysore which sold licensed Jawa and ČZ motorcycles beginning in 1960 under the brand name Jawa and later Yezdi. The catchphrase for the bikes sold by the firm was \"Forever bike forever value\". Jawa motorcycles were introduced in India in 1960 and they have a cult following to this present day. Production was carried out directly in India by Ideal Jawa India Ltd based out of Mysore. The factory was inaugurated by the then Governor of Mysore State, Jayachamaraja Wadiyar in 1961. The Jawa 353/04 designated as 'A' Type, Yezdi 250 'B' Type, Jawa 350 type 634 Twin and Yezdi 250 Monarch models are driven to this day in various parts of the country. Jawa and Yezdi bikes, especially the ones with fuel tank paddings and ignition systems on the fuel tank are now collectors items. The company stopped production in 1996. There are still several bike enthusiasts in the country. There are several bike clubs across the country, some of them even organizing long distance rallies."

The headquarters moved to Andheri in suburban Mumbai in late 2000 to accommodate its growing strength. Out-sourced product development has been the bread-n-butter for the company, which has helped finance several product development projects, which so far have not met any level of market success. After opting out of off-shore services in 2005, and a subsequent management re-shuffle, the company's financial health has seen a steady decline."

  "text" : "Indah Water Konsortium Sdn Bhd (\"IWK\") is a national sewerage company in Malaysia. IWK is wholly government-owned company which has been entrusted with the task of developing and maintaining a modern and efficient sewerage system for West Malaysia. In 1994, the Federal Government awarded the company the concession for nationwide sewerage services which prior to that, was under the responsibility of local authorities. Since then, IWK has taken over the sewerage services from local authorities in all areas except the States of Kelantan, Sabah, Sarawak and the Majlis Perbandaran Johor Bahru. A modern and efficient sewerage system is vital for the country so as to ensure that wastewater is treated before being discharged into our rivers. This will help preserve the country's waste resources, protect public health and provide a cleaner and safer environment. In June 2000, as testimony of the Government's seriousness in ensuring that a proper and efficient sewerage system will be successfully put in place and maintained, the Government, through the Minister of Finance Incorporated, took over the entire equity in IWK from its previous private owners. IWK is now well-positioned to undertake the vital task of ensuring that Malaysians today and in the future will be able to enjoy a clean and healthy environment through a proper and well-maintained sewerage system."

  "text" : "Infra Corporation is a division of EMC Corporation that produces infraEnterprise, which is a multi-tier web-based IT Service Management software tool. The software is based on the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and it implements a number of ITIL processes, including Service Desk management (including Incident Management and Problem Management), Change Management, Release Management, Configuration Management (including Federated CMDB), Availability Management and Service Level Management. The tool also includes a knowledge base module (known as the \"knowledge bank\"), which complies with principles of Knowledge Centered Support (KCS). Infra Corporation was first established in 1991 in Australia, and now has regional head offices in North America, Australia, the UK and Europe and a worldwide network of partners and distributors. Infra was acquired by Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC Corporation on 10 March 2008, in a move viewed by analysts as part of EMC's ongoing strategy to establish itself as an IT management solution provider. In 2002, infraEnterprise was awarded PinkVerify ITIL certification from Pink Elephant, an independent consulting firm specialising in ITIL and PRINCE2. Infra has won a number of awards. In 2007, they were awarded the Network Computing magazine \"Helpdesk Product of the Year\" for infraEnterprise, and were awarded HDI's Best Business Use of Business Support Technology in 2006 at the 11th Annual Help Desk and IT Support Excellence Awards. VMware acquired Ionix Service Manager (formerly Infra) in 2010 and subsequently re-branded the tool VMware Service Manager. Support for this product began on 1 July 2010  and end of support has been announced for its latest and believed last version 9.x as of 8 March 2017. In July 2014, it was announced that VMware and IT Service Management software company Alemba had entered into an agreement to hand control of the support and development of VMware Service Manager to Alemba. Under the terms of this agreement, Alemba has taken over all operational aspects of VMware Service Manager, including support, account management and consultancy. Full product support and a development roadmap will now continue past the previous end of availability date of March 2017. Alemba rebranded and relicensed the VMware Service Manager product as vFire Core. In December 2014, Alemba announced the release of vFire Core 9.2.0, the first major release of the tool under Alemba’s ownership."

ICE was founded on 8 April 1949 by Decree-Law No. 449 after the Costa Rican Civil War of 1948, in order to solve the problems of power shortages that occurred in Costa Rica in the 1940s. Since 1963 ICE provides telecommunications services throughout the country. The attempts to reform ICE throughout a set of laws in the years 1999 and 2000 generated a great social mobilization. The ruling party at that time, the Social Christian Unity Party and the main opposition National Liberation Party agreed to change the institution. Meanwhile, the citizen opposition reached 274 protests in 14days. Following the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement, the telecommunication market was opened to private companies. Since 2011, América Móvil through Claro Americas and Telefónica through Movistar, are competing against ICE in the Costa Rican mobile market. ICE Group's generates annual revenues of around $ 1,844 million."

Incitec Pivot is the largest supplier of fertilisers in Australia; the largest supplier of explosives products and services in North America; and the second largest supplier of explosives products and services in the world. The company began trading on the ASX on 30 July 2003 having been formed as the result of a merger between Incitec Fertilizers and the Pivot group, and substantially expanded with the acquisition of Southern Cross Fertilisers in 2006 and Dyno Nobel in 2008. Employing approximately 5,000 staff worldwide, Incitec Pivot has extensive operations throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Australia. In 2005, the company struck a deal with the Government of Nauru to re-develop the country's phosphate mining industry, which had fallen into disrepair. The company invested $5 million to facilities and machinery, and phosphate mining resumed in late 2006. Incitec Pivot bases a large part of its fertilizer production on imports of phosphate rock from Western Sahara, a territory which has been occupied by Morocco since 1975. Since such imports are considered in violation of international law, Incitec Pivot has been blacklisted from portfolios of several ethical investors including the United Methodist Church, Danske Bank, Storebrand, KLP, and the national pension funds of Sweden and Luxembourg."

  "text" : "The Isthmian Steamship Company was a shipping company founded by US Steel in 1910. Isthmian Steamship was the brainchild of US Steel President James A. Farrell, who had connections with the maritime industry through his father's trade as a ship's master. Farrell realized that US Steel could save substantial sums of money by owning its own fleet of freighters, rather than chartering cargo space from other companies. Farrell named the company after the Isthmus of Panama, in honour of America's recent construction achievement, the Panama Canal. Farrell headquartered Isthmian Steamship in London, partly in order to take advantage of Great Britain's respected name in the industry, and partly to benefit from Britain's long history of maritime experience. Management of the company was assigned to the British Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd, a company which traced its own origins back as far as 1782 with the British East India Company. The US end of Farrell's new company was managed by the Norton Lilly Agency. The company's first ship was the SS Bantu, a British vessel launched in 1902 and purchased by US Steel in 1907 for a reputed £24,000. By 1914, the company had purchased six additional ships – Kentra, Buenaventura, Santa Rosalia, Charleton Hall, Craston Hall and the sleek cargo liner Crofton Hall – all sturdy British steamships. With the outbreak of World War I however, Farrell brought the company back under the protective cover of the flag of America, which was not at the time a belligerent. The company would continue to expand its operations in the ensuing decades. In 1956 however, the by then highly lucrative company was sold to States Marine Lines. US Steel justified the sale on the grounds that Isthmian's overall usefulness had diminished, as it now carried only a fraction of the corporation's exports. It continued to operate as a property of States Marine until the early 1970s. Its last list of corporate officers is dated 1974."

  "text" : "Istithmar World (\"istithmar\" is Arabic for \"investment\") is an investment firm based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). This company is a state-run business owned by Dubai World, a Dubai government-owned company, and was established in 2003. Originally known as \"Istithmar,\" the company was renamed as \"Istithmar World\" in 2008. Istithmar World, which was created in 2003 as the investment arm of Dubai World specializes in private equity and alternative investment opportunities globally. In the five years since its inception, Istithmar World has built a portfolio of investments in markets ranging from North America and Europe to Asia and the Middle East, and across a variety of sectors, including consumer, industrial, financial services and real estate. An analysis of Istithmar's investment portfolio which included the investment of $3.8 billion with an associated $14 billion of debt, has not performed positively. In a number of cases, Istithmar has lost control of assets or sold at a loss. As a subsidiary of Dubai World, the company has been mentioned in numerous press reports related to the high debt levels of its parent. Since late 2009, the company has seen numerous departures of high-profile executives."

It has a partnership with Indiana University School of Medicine. IU Health is known for its three Indianapolis hospitals that have deep roots in Indiana: IU Health Methodist, the largest private hospital in Indiana with a capacity of 625 beds; Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, the state’s first pediatric hospital; and IU Health University Hospital, the largest teaching hospital in the state. The three Indianapolis hospitals, along with administrative offices and a centralized pathology lab, are located on a linear “campus” served by a driverless People Mover train that runs on elevated tracks through downtown Indianapolis. At the north end of the tracks is Methodist, which has a distinctive lighthouse beacon on its roof and has long served as the official hospital for race car drivers injured at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In 2015, IU Health announced it would undertake its most far-reaching development plan: combining most operations of its Methodist and University hospitals into a new consolidated hospital to be built at the Methodist site. Construction was expected to begin in 2017 and last several years, at an estimated cost of over $1 billion."

  "text" : "Instron (an ITW company) is a manufacturer of test equipment designed to evaluate the mechanical properties of materials and components, such as universal testing machines. In 1946, Harold Hindman and George Burr, who worked together at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), teamed up to determine the properties of new materials to be used in parachutes. Together, they designed a material testing machine based on strain gauge load cells and servo-control systems. This led to the formation of Instron Engineering Corporation. CEAST (Now operating within Instron) was founded in 1953 by Dr. Mario Grosso and focussed initially on refurbishing instruments shipped from America through the Marshall plan. Later, the company used its experience to develop polymer testing instruments. Today the company is based in Pianezza, Turin, and specializes in impact, rheology and HDT/Vicat testing of polymers, typically thermoplastics. In 2008 CEAST was acquired by Instron but continues to operate semi-autonomously."

Under this agreement, ISC is responsible for the management and operation of the land titles, personal property, and corporate registries, the land surveys directory, geographic information, and access to certain government services for business. The Government of Saskatchewan manages the contractual relationship with ISC through the Office of Public Registry Administration at the Ministry of Justice. This Office contains the government-appointed registry officials responsible for oversight of each of the registries and the land surveys directory. Three government agencies came together to form ISC in January 2000: the Land Titles Office (which was then a part of the Department of Justice), the Personal Property Registry (also part of Justice) and the Surveys, Mapping and Geographic Information Systems division of the Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation. In 2008, the Vital Statistics Registry, which had been a part of the Department of Health, was transferred to ISC. In June 2013, the Vital Statistics Registry transferred to eHealth Saskatchewan. The Corporate Registry (formerly known as the Corporations Branch as part of the Ministry of Justice) became part of ISC in October 2010. In 2011, ISC launched Business Registrations Saskatchewan. In 2013, Information Services Corporation became a publicly traded company. ISC employs over 300 people and has offices in eight Saskatchewan communities: Humboldt, Moose Jaw, North Battleford, Prince Albert, Regina, Saskatoon, Swift Current and Yorkton. For 2012 and 2013, ISC was named by Mediacorp one of Canada’s Best Diversity Employers, a Top 20 Saskatchewan Employer, and one of Canada's Greenest Employers. For 2012, ISC was also named by Mediacorp one of Canada's Top Employers for Young People."

The lifeline of Sindh, brings minerals and soil from the Himalayas to the region and flows into the Arabian Sea at the Indus River Delta located in Sindh. These factors define the scope of Sindhology: the study of antiquities, the relics, the history, and the culture both of ancient and modern Sindh, with particular reference to Sindhi society and literature.

  "text" : "IG Port (株式会社IGポート Kabushiki-gaisha Ai Jī Pōto) is a Japanese holding company that was established on December 1, 2007 as a result from a merger between the holding companies of Japanese anime studio Production I.G and manga publisher Mag Garden. The announcement of the merger between Production I.G and Mag Garden was on July 4, 2007. Specifically, the original company, Production I.G, was transformed into a holding company a month before the merger. Along with a name change, it transferred most of its former duties and management to a new developed subsidiary called Production I.G. After the merger with Mag Garden by stock exchange a month later, IG Port (the \"old\" I.G and Mag holding companies) now fully owns the \"new\" Production I.G, XEBEC, and Mag Garden as its subsidiaries. In 2014, IG Port announced it was forming a new animation division named SIGNAL.MD. Its goal is said to be develop technology for full digital animation and smart devices. It will also build the foundation for the production of animation aimed at children and families (including Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys, Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram and White—Victini and Zekrom and Pokémon Origins). Production I.G board member, Katsuji Morishita is expected to serve as president of SIGNAL.MD."

  "text" : "Intelliquip, LLC develops browser-based software also known as the Intelligent Front-End. The basic function of the company's software is to automate the front-end sales process for complex equipment. The software is specialized for the fluid handling equipment industry and is compatible with pumps, compressors, valves, blowers, turboexpanders, heat exchangers, actuators, filters, seals, couplings, motors, and variable-frequency drives. The Intelligent Front-End is composed of three main products: the Intelliquip Selector, the Intelliquip Configurator, and the Intelliquip Quote Manager. Together, these products create an integrated application that allows users to quickly select, configure, price, and quote complex products. Intelliquip was founded in July 2000 by Dave Brockway, Tryg Dahl, Mike Joy, and David Tress. The company's headquarters and primary software development office is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, with an additional sales office in Orlando, Florida. Intelliquip’s multilingual and multicurrency implementations have been completed with large and small companies located across the globe, including North America, Europe, India, and Asia. Intelliquip's browser-based software incorporates the concept of software as a service (SaaS), which is a means to deploy a subscription-based, hosted service that users access via the Internet, without the need to install software on a user's computer. The SaaS platform for Intelliquip’s Intelligent Front-End allows its clients to deploy selection and configuration solutions for their equipment directly to their internal sales force and their sales channels. The company has licensed FPX's patented, core configurator engine for use in its software. Intelliquip is also a member of the Hydraulic Institute, the largest association of pump industry manufacturers in North America. It is part of the Hydraulic Institute's Electronic Data Exchange Committee to participate in a project with FIATECH to adopt AEX cfiXML schemas and implement them in Intelliquip's software. This initiative is developing standards to automate information exchange for the design, procurement, delivery, installation, operation, and maintenance of engineered equipment."

The company was established in 1984 by current supervisory board chairman and Chief Technology Advisor, August-Wilhelm Scheer as a spin-off from the Institute for Information Systems. Based on Dr. Scheer’s early Y-Model, developed in the 1980s, IDS Scheer’s ARIS product and related consulting services is the heart of the company’s technology and revenue. In 2009 it was acquired by Software AG. IDS Scheer has a dominant BPM market-share in Europe and is considered well-positioned in the US market based on its partnerships with Microsoft, SAP, HP, Oracle, IBM and TIBCO as well as consistent financial success and numerous favorable reports from Gartner, Forrester, and AMR Research. However, the company is less well known in the US market, warranting some in the US to call IDS Scheer a “better kept secret.” The company holds the unique distinction of being embedded in the products of SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. End-user markets for IDS Scheer include consumer packaged goods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, papers, metals, retail and textile industries."

  "text" : "The International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) is a non-profit organization committed to furthering international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety. Its aim is to advance the science and application of space safety. IAASS was legally established on April 16, 2004 in the Netherlands. It became a member of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) in October 2004. The IAASS is based on the intellectual interaction of individual members who together shape the technical vision of the association, and make the association services available to stakeholders (on a non-profit basis). In June 2006, former US Senator John Glenn and first American to orbit became an Honorary Member. In June 2010, IAASS was granted the Observer status at the United Nations COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space). The association counts more than 200 professional members from 25 countries, 55% of the members are from industry, while the remaining 45% come from space agencies, governmental institutions and academia. A 2005 report by the Space and Advanced Communications Research Institute (SACRI) of George Washington University, titled Space Safety Report: Vulnerabilities and Risk Reduction In U.S. Human Space Flight Programs suggested that the newly formed IAASS might help improve the safety of the International Space Station (ISS). It also recommended NASA work with the IAASS to develop safety standards and advancement of space debris minimization and control. The first IAASS conference was held in Nice, France in October 2005. The European Space Agency sponsored the second IAASS Conference \"Space Safety in a Global World\" in May 2007 in Chicago. The third conference was held 21–23 October 2008 in Rome, Italy. The fourth conference was held 19–21 May in Huntsville, USA. The fifth conference was held 17–19 October 2011 in Versailles, France, and the 6th conference 21–23 May 2013 in Montreal, Canada."

  "text" : "The Ideas Campaign is a grassroots initiative in the Republic of Ireland asking ordinary people for ideas to stimulate economic activity. The origins of the campaign can be traced back to the TV appearance by businesswoman Aileen O'Toole on a special edition of the current affairs programme Prime Time on RTÉ about the state of the Irish economy in January 2009. She argued in the programme that the current focus on economic problems meant that positive, practical ideas for economic growth were being overlooked. In response to her appearance, Prime Time did a follow-up programme on 5 March 2009, on which she launched the Ideas Campaign. The submission for ideas closed at the end of March 2009 and centres on a website - IdeasCampaign.ie - on which ordinary citizens can submit their ideas to stimulate economic growth. Some 1,750 ideas were submitted in the campaign's first week The ideas were then reviewed by an advisory group and distilled into a report. The action plan was released on the 14 May. Read the full Ideas Campaign Action Plan. The Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, issued a statement on 8 March 2009 that he would ensure that the report will be \"fast-tracked to the Cabinet sub-committee on Economic Renewal for assessment and implementation, where appropriate\". On Tuesday 21 July 2009 the Irish Government announced its response to the Ideas Campaign. A total of 17 of the 44 ideas included in the campaign’s Action Plan, in areas such as active citizenship, the knowledge economy, tourism and government finances, are to be implemented on the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal."

The ISHL, now the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library (ALPL), participated from 1987 to 1995. The CHS, now the Chicago History Museum (CHM), worked on the project from 1989 to 2009 in the 19 northernmost Illinois counties. When the UIUC Library joined the project in June 1995 (and the INP relocated its offices there), it became responsible for the central and southern Illinois counties."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with Integrity Music.) Integrity Records is an independent record label based in Bedford, England. The label was founded in the early 1990s and specialised in discovering new bands in the rock/indie/punk genres. The first release on the label was 1996 single 'Ghost Island' by The Traceys, but the label is most notable for signing bands such as Miss Black America and Million Dead, whose vocalist Frank Turner went on to forge a successful solo career. John Peel was a great supporter of the label and played the vast majority of their releases on his BBC Radio 1 show. In 2002, 5 Integrity releases (including B-sides) appeared in Peel's annual Festive Fifty. Over the years, Integrity has also been the UK home for American artists such as Katastrophy Wife and Meow Meow. In December 2005 Integrity released a single by London-based noiseniks October All Over, after which the label entered a hiatus. In March 2011, the label announced via social media feeds that it was active again and welcomed two new signings. A redesigned official website then confirmed those signings as Travis + Julie from Nashville, Tennessee and Birmingham dream-indie duo Pet Dog Storm. Travis + Julie's single Osmosis preceded their album Moon Girl whilst Pet Dog Storm released debut single Time to Fly from their album Beautiful is Down. In June 2012 the label announced the signing of Scottish art-rockers Miniature Dinosaurs, followed by a single \"Lemonade\" in July and the \"Turn It On EP\" in November. Their roster grew further with the addition of Birmingham alt pop band TheLights with the single \"Days Don't Get Me Far Enough Away\". November 2012 saw a deal announced with Futur Primitif, the new project of Daniel Lefkowitz, former member of American indie-folk band The Low Anthem, followed by the release of two singles, Nuclear Shockwave and Digital Space, and the album Machineteeth. In 2013 the label signed Valentiine, are an all-girl trio from Melbourne, Australia, and have released singles Love Like and Chucky, before their debut album Valentiine in July. Later in the year, the label signed both Horse Party and Wolverhampton based indie-electronica outfit Silhouettes, with the latter releasing their debut single \"Gold Tag\" in November 2013, and debut album \"Ever Moving Happiness Machines\" in January 2014."

  "text" : "InterMapper is a cross-platform, network monitoring, and network mapping program. It is produced by HelpSystems. The current version of InterMapper comes with a variety of network probes based on ping, SNMP, http and other network protocols used to monitor the state of networked devices and servers. It displays the status of the devices it monitors in maps or lists. For example, the software can monitor the internal state of Apple Inc. Xserves such as fan speed and cpu temperature remotely by using a probe to query the servers. Intermapper can also discover network devices by probing a network, building a map of devices found in each network segment starting from a single IP address. Intermapper also supports alarms for devices that have disappeared from the network or which are in a warning state, and can send alerts via email, pager, console alerts, or script execution. The software can be configured to display graphs of performance data stored at variable intervals to show trends. Intermapper can export data for use with Google Earth to show network infrastructure on a map, and provides a web service for display of network status and maps. InterMapper began as a Macintosh program, and was created at Dartmouth College, supporting monitors via both SNMP and AppleTalk. Dartware was purchased from the original founders in December of 2012, by HelpSystems. None of the original founders (William Fisher, Richard Brown) remain."

  "text" : "Intransitive Recordings is an independent record label for experimental music, founded in Gainesville, Florida in 1997 by the artist Howard Stelzer and currently based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Intransitive publishes electro-acoustic music, free improvisation, sound art, sound poetry, and noise music. Since its inception, Intransitive has released over 36 albums. When the label began, its goal was to self-publish work by Stelzer: \"... (the) reason for starting Intransitive was to publish my own work. I had recorded « Stone Blind » , a one-hour-long tape piece, and knew that no one outside of Florida had ever heard of me, so no one would have any reason to put it out. I just did it myself, and subsequently fell in love with the idea of putting out CDs.\" In 1998, Stelzer decided to publish work by other composers, and reached out to people whose music he had long admired. \"Since it was so easy to publish one CD, I felt empowered (and bold!) enough to ask two of my favorite artists, Brume (Christian Renou, from France) and Kapotte Muziek (Frans de Waard, from the Netherlands) to submit an album for me to put out.\" In 2002, Stelzer was asked by Philippe Petit of Bip-Hop Magazine if his label's mission was to discover and promote up-and-coming new artists. Stelzer replied that it was not: \"Many of the artists whose work appears on Intransitive are folks whose music I’ve been excited about since I was young. Brume, for example, is someone whose music first excited me when I was 16 years old and in high school. Frans de Waard’s Kapotte Muziek records and cassettes are things I’ve been listening to for years and years. Same with Marc Behrens and others. In many cases, I use the label to give something back (in a way) to the artists who I admire by publishing their new works. In addition to publishing CDs and records, Intransitive Recordings also hosts concerts in the Boston area."

  "text" : "Ink Dish is an American tableware design company located in San Diego, California. The company uses designs by contemporary underground artists for their line of porcelain dinnerware. Ink Dish was founded in 2008 by David Harding and Caroline Pople. Julie Pople, mother of Caroline, is the lead designer for Ink Dish. Julie graduated from Liverpool Art College (John Moores University) in 1971 with a degree in Textile Design. Julie was an in-house ceramic designer for Royal Stafford, Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent until becoming the head of design for the European arm of the ceramic company PT Sango. In 2008, Ink Dish partnered with Paul Timman to create a line of tattoo inspired porcelain dinnerware. \"I knew that if I did my job well, I could bridge the gap between mainstream society and help to introduce tattooing into everyday life -- without the process of getting tattooed,\" says Timman. The Irezumi tableware design by Paul Timman was named to Metropolitan Home's 2009 Design 100 list  The design is based on the Japanese style of tattooing known as Irezumi. In 2010 Ink Dish partnered with modern artists David Palmer and Dana Oldfather. In 2011 Ink Dish had established a partnership with artist Alyson Fox. Ink Dish also designs patterns for tableware manufacturers such as Villeroy & Boch, Macy's, and Corelle. Among the best known of the company's product range are Paul Timman's pattern Cherry Ink, Alyson Fox's pattern December, and Dana Oldfather's pattern Kites."

  "text" : "iFixit is a private company in San Luis Obispo, California. Founded in 2003 while the founders were attending Cal Poly, the company sells repair parts and publishes free wiki-like online repair guides for consumer electronics and gadgets on its web site. The company is also known for their \"teardowns\" of consumer devices. iFixit product teardowns of new Apple products are carried by PC World, the Mac Observer, NetworkWorld and other publications. Founder Kyle Wiens aims to reduce electronic waste by teaching people to repair their own gear and offering tools, parts, and a forum to discuss repairs. In 2011, he travelled through Africa with a documentary team; a short film is in progress  and stories of \"fixers\" met on the trip are posted on the company's activism-oriented blog, ifixit.org. iFixit provides a SaaS platform known as Dozuki to enable others to use iFixit's documentation framework to produce their own documentation. An early adopter was O'Reilly Media, whose Make and Craft magazines use Dozuki to feature community guides alongside instructions originally written by the staff for the print magazine. In September 2015, Apple removed the iFixit app from the App Store in reaction to the company's publication of a teardown of a developer pre-release version of the Apple TV (4th generation) obtained under Apple's Developer Program violating a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement and as such their developer account was suspended. iFixit has since worked on developing a more user friendly mobile site so mobile users can still access iFixit."

Following the successful launch of the San Francisco fund, IDG organized its non-publishing investments in China into venture funds. In 2009, IDG Ventures China renamed itself IDG Capital Partners to reflect the breadth of its half dozen funds encompassing start-up venture through growth investments. In 2000, IDG started a fund in Europe; this fund is now closed. In 2001, IDG started a fund in Boston, also named IDG Ventures. The manager of the Boston fund renamed itself Flybridge Capital Partners in 2008 and is no longer associated with the IDG Ventures funds. In the 2000s, IDG started funds in Vietnam, India, and Korea. As of 2013, there are five countries with IDG funds - China, Vietnam, India, Korea and the United States (San Francisco)."

  "text" : "Indian Thought Publications is a publisher founded in 1942, in Mysore by R. K. Narayan. Narayan founded the company as he was cut off from England owing to the war and needed an outlet for his works. The first book to be published by the company was Malgudi Days, in 1943. The publishing company followed a short-lived journal that he founded, of the same name. The company is currently managed from a tiny home-office in Chennai by Narayan's granddaughter Bhuvaneswari (Minnie). Although the company was started as an effort in self-publishing, it is far from being a vanity press. The war and other factors meant that the his British publishers did not stock their Indian warehouses and Indian readers had no access to his books resulting in Narayan starting the company. Most of the work was done by Narayan himself including distribution and collecting delinquent bills. During one such task, he met with the proprietor of India Book House who convinced him to hand over the distribution function to them. India Book House continues to be the company's sole distributor. In 2006, on Narayan's birth centenary, Indian Thought Publications issued a commemorative coffee table edition of his 1974 autobiography, My Days, with an introduction by his long-time admirer Alexander McCall Smith."

  "text" : "iWantGreatCare.org is a service which allows NHS and private health care patients to rate individual GPs, hospital doctors and nursing staff on the care they provide. Launched in July 2008, the service was founded by Dr. Neil Bacon FRCP, the founder of Doctors.net.uk, the largest independent online network of doctors in the UK. The company collects information from patients regarding the quality of care they have received from their doctor and other healthcare professionals, and believes that the capture of real-time patient feedback and experiences will lead to a higher level of healthcare in the UK. The controversial launch evoked outrage from some UK doctors against a system of collecting feedback on the care they provide to patients. In November 2014 the site had collected only 400 patient reviews of GPs, which are published on its website. Rt Hon Alan Milburn, the former UK Secretary of State for Health, is the Chairman of iWantGreatCare. Dr Neil Bacon is a commentator on e-health and patient feedback. In June 2012, he formed part of a UK delegation invited to Washington for the Health Datapalooza, a US health data forum attended by UK health secretary Andrew Lansley, US President Barack Obama and Jon Bon Jovi. The discussion centred on how the two countries can work more closely to make health data a driver for innovation, economic growth and – most importantly – better care for patients."

  "text" : "Indramat GmbH, now part of Bosch Rexroth, was an industrial control firm founded in 1958, based in Neuwied (am Rhein), Germany. Its name is a German abbreviation meaning “Gesellschaft zur INDustrialisierung-RAtionalisierung und AutoMATisierung“ (Association for Industrialization, Rationalization, and Automation). The core business was the production of industrial servo drives and motion controls for use on machine tools, machine presses, printing presses, food packaging machinery, as well as assembly lines and material handling equipment. Indramat was acquired by the hydraulic concern Rexroth in 1965, for Rexroth to gain competence in machine control. At that time, Indramat was moved to the German town of Lohr am Main, Rexroth’s headquarters. In 1968 Rexroth, including Indramat GmbH, was taken over by Mannesmann AG. In 2001, after the hostile takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone, the industrial portion of Mannesmann was acquired by Robert Bosch GmbH, including Rexroth and Indramat. The new entity was named Bosch Rexroth, and Indramat GmbH became the Electric Drives and Controls Technology Group under Bosch Rexroth. The name Indramat was no longer used, however Bosch Rexroth Electric Drives and Controls continues to produce and support products originally marketed under the Indramat brand, and newer product families such as the IndraDrive, IndraDyn, and IndraControl are named in recognition of their heritage. In 2001 Indramat employed 1,500, with a turnover of 261 million Euro. Exports constituted 52% of the business. Indramat gained recognition in Germany and Central Europe starting in the 1970s as a supplier of DC servo drives and control systems, especially in the areas of sheet steel processing, and 3-dimensional tracing controls. A key feature of the Indramat servo is the programming module (called a “Personality Module” in the North American market), which contained all variable settings required to match the servo amplifier with a given motor. This feature greatly simplified the commissioning process. In 1979 Indramat released a brushless drive servo system, which it branded as an “AC Servo”. This product gained acceptance in automotive industry Powertrain manufacturing, bringing Indramat global recognition. Indramat is also recognized for distributed CNCs for automotive Powertrain manufacturing, and electronic line shaft technology for commercial printing presses."

  "text" : "The International Grooving & Grinding Association (IGGA) is a non-profit trade association founded in 1972 that represents the industry that performs grooving and grinding of both concrete and asphalt surfaces in addition to Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) and Concrete Pavement Preservation (CPP) methods. CPR and CPP methods are a series of engineered techniques developed during the last 40 years to manage the rate of pavement deterioration in concrete streets, highways and airports. A non-overlay option used to repair areas of distress in concrete pavement without changing its grade, CPR restores the pavement to a condition close to or better than original and reduces the need for major and more costly repairs later. CPP/CPR addresses the cause of pavement distress, minimizing further deterioration. Covering road distress with an asphalt overlay does not correct the cause and will eventually manifest itself again, usually as a larger, more expensive problem. Asphalt overlays typically last eight to 12 years, whereas CPP and CPR last up to 30 years. In 1995, the IGGA joined in affiliation with the American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA) to represent its newly formed CPR Division. The IGGA/ACPA CPR Division now serves as the technical resource and industry representative in the marketing of optimized pavement surfaces, CPR and pavement preservation globally. As of 2009, the IGGA had more than 60 members. The IGGA is made up of contractors, manufacturers, suppliers, consultants and public officials representing all facets of the industry. In addition to a diversified Board of Directors, the IGGA is served by a Communications Committee whose activities include public relations, development of marketing materials and industry promotion. The Environmental Committee is in place to research and educate the industry about key issues affecting the marketplace."

After entering into a partnership with the video game developer and publisher Eidos Interactive, Innerloop merged with DiMaga Studios in 1997 and changed its name to Innerloop Studios to reflect the merger. In the fall of 2000, Swedish electronic entertainment company Vision Park acquired the studio. In 2002, Innerloop once again became an independent company before shutting its doors in June 2003. The company was unable to make funds to create future titles,so they finally decided to shut down the studio. Company staff numbers ranged between 15 and 25 at various times throughout the company's existence. Innerloop was widely known for its graphics technology, first on display in the flight simulator JSF - Joint Strike Fighter. With the release of Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In in December 2000, the exclusion of being able to save the game within a level created controversy amongst its fans. Except the sports game Sega Extreme Sports for Sega Dreamcast, Innerloop chose to develop exclusively for the PC platform. Co-founder Henning Rokling was the company's Managing Director until the studio shut down its operations in 2003. In addition to working with Eidos Interactive, Innerloop also worked with Infogrames, Sega, Empire Interactive and Codemasters."

The British company was in competition with Ital Design, Pininfarina, Bertone. By the early 1990s the company employed over 1400 professionals. The majority of the projects completed by IAD was never made public keeping the high level of security that John Shute believed was the key to customers allowing IAD to be considered for future projects. The company was awarded the Queen's Award for Export and Industry many times and ultimately John was appointed an OBE (Order of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth II for his endeavors on behalf of the British Motor industry.IAD Worthing Herald Article IAD designed and developed many cutting edge and memorable concept cars developed as showcases demonstrating the company's creative and engineering expertise including the IAD Alien, IAD Hunter, IAD Interstate, IAD Arrival, IAD Royale, IAD Mini MPV, IAD Venus and finally the IAD Magia. IAD amassed a talented group of designers, engineers and prototype builders who have subsequently gone on to senior positions within the automotive industry. They specialized in car prototyping and engineering design. Mayflower Corp. purchased IAD after it went into receivership in the early 1990s with the Engineering, Design groups and facilities were sold to Daewoo Motors 1993. The Mazda MX5 (Miata) was one of the many projects IAD was involved in, developing not only Exterior and Interior style for the vehicle in the UK/ US (California) but also building prototypes locally prior to volume production in 1989. Mazda came to IAD to replicate the \"true\" British sports car invoking the MG's success of handling, and even directed the Chassis team to copy the exhaust note of early MGBs."

  "text" : "Inner Four, Inc. is a software company that develops a wide range of Mobile apps, with a focus on the Apple iPhone. The company was founded July 2007 as an internet marketing firm. The company spun off an IPv6 network management tools division at the end of 2007 doing business as 3dSNMP. Since the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2008, the company has shifted nearly all of its resources to iPhone Mobile app development. May 2009 Inner Four's app for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, titled Weird Laws, achieved the #1 overall free ranked download position in the Apple iTunes App Store. July 2009 Inner Four's app for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, titled Mirror Free, achieved the #1 overall free ranked download position in the Apple iTunes App Store. Amazingly, the company's own President admits the app doesn't actually do anything, and was intended as a joke. Unfortunately for the company, much of the early advertising revenue that would have been generated from ads in this app were lost due to a coding error. September 2009 Inner Four's app for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, titled Finger Security, achieved the #1 overall free ranked download position in the Apple iTunes App Store. March 2010 Inner Four and The Jerky Boys jointly announce two apps for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, titled The Jerky Boys Prank Caller and The Jerky Boys Pinball."

Examples of findings in IBI studies include: \n*  Employers that shift too much of the cost of drugs to workers in their company health plans could wind up losing more than they save, through absenteeism and lost productivity \n*  Employers severely underestimate the prevalence and lost productivity costs of depression \n*  The importance of addressing co-morbidities—employees with multiple chronic health conditions drive the largest effects on productivity loss \n*  Companies that effectively manage health-related productivity as a corporate best practice also tend to be more profitable"

Invite Media was purchased shortly after Google completed their acquisition of AdMob on May 2, 2010. Google's purchase of Invite Media has caused controversy among consumer advocacy groups, as John M. Simpson of Consumer Watchdog puts it: \"The ink is hardly dry on Google's questionable AdMob acquisition, and the Internet giant is forging ahead with an insatiable appetite for more. When is enough, enough?\"  There was speculation about Google acquiring Invite Media almost as soon as the AdMob deal was successfully completed, because Invite Media offered \"a three-year-old “demand-side platform” designed to help buyers navigate high-volume display-advertising exchanges\"."

  "text" : "Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats) is in the business of mining, refining and marketing of platinum group metals (PGMs), as well as nickel, copper and cobalt. In the 2009 financial year, Implats produced 1.7Moz of platinum (approximately 25% of global supply) and 3.4Moz of PGMs. The group employs approximately 53,000 people (including contractors) across its operations and is one of the most efficient and lowest cost primary platinum producers in the world. The company is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the LSE. In March 2011, the government of Zimbabwe implemented laws which required local ownership of mining companies; following this news, there were falls in the share prices of companies with mines in Zimbabwe, including Implats. In late January 2014 thousands of employees belonging to Impala Platinum and other platinum mines in South Africa went on strike, demanding a basic salary of R12,500 ($1,180). This is the same salary for which striking miners were shot and killed by the South African Police Service (SAPS) in 2012. Most of the miners belonged to the miners' union 'AMCU' which South African politician and Commander in Chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters had vowed to sponsor in order to allow the miners to continue striking. The platinum miners were mainly based in Marikana, the town in which Malema jump started his political party and gained popularity with most of the miners. It is estimated that the miners lost a minimum R10 billion in salaries due to their strike which lasted more than five months. Striking miners attacked other miners that were 'caught' going to work, accusing them of \"betraying the revolution\". The strike, the longest in the history of South Africa, ended in late June 2014 when the mineworkers union signed a 3-year settlement deal with Impala Platinum and the other platinum mine owners which saw the lowest paid workers, whose basic salary was less than R12,500, increased by R1,000 ($95) a month for two years, and by R950 per month in the third year. The agreement also ensured no platinum worker would earn less than R8,000 as a basic salary."

After the end of World War II it continued producing firearms, both for military and hunting applications, and later high-tech weapons and civilian machinery. After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union the range of civilian products was greatly expanded, but firearms were still its major production. Baikal firearms can still be bought from Remington under the name Ranger. Since 1960 Izhmekh supplied hunting shotguns for export under the trademark \"Baikal\". Their products also included various hand held pistols, including the popular Baikal IZH-79. Izhmekh was widely known for having developed and manufactured Makarov and Yarygin pistols. It was also one of the primary factories producing Mosin–Nagant and SVT-40 rifles during World War II for standard issue to Soviet troops. On August 13, 2013, Izhmash and Izhevsk Mechanical Plant were merged and formally renamed Kalashnikov Concern."

Founded in 1998 in the Netherlands, the firm was publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange on January 28, 2011. Interxion is headquartered in Schiphol-Rijk, the Netherlands, and delivers its services through 40 data centres in 11 countries located in major metropolitan areas, including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid, the main data centre markets in Europe. The company’s core offering is carrier-neutral colocation, which includes provision of space, power and a secure environment in which to house customers’ computing, network, storage and IT infrastructure. Interxion also supplements its core colocation offering with a number of additional services, including systems monitoring, systems management, engineering support services, data back-up and storage. Within its data centres, Interxion enables approximately 1,500 customers to house their equipment and connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, ISPs and other customers. The data centres act as content and connectivity hubs that facilitate the processing, storage, sharing and distribution of data, content, applications and media among carriers and customers. Interxion’s customer base is in high-growth market segments, including financial services, cloud and managed services providers, digital media and carriers. Customers in these target markets enable expansion of existing communities of interest and build new, high-value communities of interest within the data centre. Communities of interest are particularly important to customers in each of these market segments. For example, customers in the digital media segment benefit from the close proximity to content delivery network providers and Internet exchanges in order to rapidly deliver content to consumers. Interxion expects the high-value and reduced-cost benefits of communities of interest to continue to attract new customers. Interxion’s data centres enable its customers to connect to more than 500 carriers and ISPs and 20 European Internet exchanges, allowing them to lower telecommunications costs and reduce latency times."

  "text" : "Intermountain West Communications Company is an American telecommunications company, formerly owned by James E. \"Jim\" Rogers (1938–2014), that owns licenses for a number of local television stations in the United States, operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, IWCC was founded on October 1, 1979, following the purchase of KORK-TV, the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, by local attorney James E. \"Jim\" Rogers and 16 Las Vegas residents. KORK-TV was renamed KVBC-TV after taking control and KSNV-DT on July 9, 2010 and Rogers expanded Sunbelt's reach to include other stations in Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming. In 2008, Sunbelt was renamed Intermountain West Communications Company; Rogers was at his summer home in Montana when he was asked about the \"SUNBELT\" license plate on his car when Montana wasn't a Sun Belt state. Most of IWCC's stations, prior to the gradual sale of them that began in 2013, were NBC affiliates. On September 3, 2014, Intermountain West Communications announced that it would sell KSNV-DT to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $120 million. As Sinclair already owned a duopoly in Las Vegas, KVMY (channel 21) and KVCW (channel 33), the company planned to sell the license assets (though not the programming) of one of the three stations to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, with the divested station's programming being moved to the other stations. 80–85% of proceeds from the sale will go toward the formation of the Rogers Educational Foundation, which will support students and educators in Southern Nevada. On November 1, 2014, KSNV began the process of swapping signals with KVMY; KVMY moved its MyNetworkTV programming to a subchannel of KVCW, which was replaced by a simulcast of KSNV-DT's programming. Additionally, the two stations swapped virtual channel numbers, which moved KVMY to channel 3, and KSNV to channel 21. On November 4, 2014, the call letters on KVMY's license were changed to KSNV, and the existing KSNV license changed its call letters to KVMY. These moves effectively put KSNV under Sinclair ownership using its existing channel 21 license. The previous channel 3 license was later sold to Howard Stirk Holdings. A similar swap occurred during Sinclair's acquisition of WCIV, in which its ABC programming and call sign were moved to another Sinclair-owned signal, and the previous WCIV channel 4 license (renamed WMMP) was sold to Howard Stirk Holdings, though the PSIP channel number was not swapped. Sinclair could not buy KSNV-DT outright because Las Vegas has only seven full-power stations--four too few to legally permit a duopoly. When the sale closes, Sinclair would control half of those stations. It would also create a situation in which a CW affiliate is the nominal senior partner in a duopoly involving an NBC affiliate and a \"Big Four\" station."

  "text" : "The International Vale Tudo Championship is an MMA fighting promotion based in Brazil starting in 1997. The first events were no holds barred contests inspired by the Ultimate Fighting Championship and gained an international reputation for its hardcore nature. Head butts and groin strikes were not forbidden. Head butts render fighters on the bottom in the guard position more vulnerable. Founded by Sergio Batarelli, it became one of the most important Vale Tudo tournaments in Brazil during its existence. While the UFC fights were held in an octagon, the IVC kept the normal ring shape. A fight lasted a maximum of 30 minutes. It was not uncommon for fighters to get a hand broken, lose teeth or receive cuts in their faces. An IVC in 1999 concluded with 8 out of 10 matches finished with strikes. After 14 events, the state of São Paulo (where the promotion was based) prohibited the sanctioning of the Vale Tudo fights, and the event entered an hiatus period. In January 2011, during an interview to channel Combate, Sergio Batarelli announced the return of the IVC in mid-2012 with a new ruleset (based on the UFC rules) and acting as a feeder promotion to the UFC. IVC makes a return via kickboxing on Saturday, August 20, 2016 in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The main event at IVC 15 is Felipe Micheletti Vs. Rogelio Ortiz for the World Kickboxing Network super cruiserweight world title. The event also includes MMA and Kickboxing tournaments."

Products such as Problem (IT) and Procedure (IT) aim to help physicians more easily choose the correct medical term for their cases, which then aids in finding the correct billing code. This allows the clinician to capture the patient condition more accurately, with more familiar terms and without slowing the EHR workflow. These products' medical vocabularies are regularly updated so as to be mapped with standardized vocabularies such as ICD and SNOMED, as well as to adhere to the October 1, 2013/2014 date of compliance for migrating to ICD-10. Each IMO term within the clinical interface terminology is in turn mapped to the appropriate administrative code set. This allows the evolution of code sets to go on and minimize the impact on the clinician; as code sets/rules change, all re-mappings are handled by IMO, enabling the clinicians to continue leveraging the same vernacular. IMO works with companies such as MEDITECH, Allscripts, Cerner and Epic Systems, providing vocabularies for the companies' health care software applications to be used by various hospitals and physicians in those companies' client networks. IMO's products and vocabularies are thus used in sites across the United States. In 2012, IMO opened a research and development office on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign to be staffed by student interns from the university. In February 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article that demonstrates how IMO's interface terminology was found to accurately categorize coronary heart disease and heart failure events. IMO's terminology service was found to be 32-42% more accurate compared to algorithms using reimbursement coding and classification techniques. Later in 2013, IMO opened up a research-and-development office in the Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."

In 1998, Executive Director of Fort Worth Zoo Michael Fouraker envisioned an elephant foundation to provide funds and expertise to elephant related projects. Michael was a board member of International Rhino Foundation (IRF), and used the organizational structure and business plan of IRF as a template for multiple elephant holding facilities with diverse missions to come together for a shared common goal of contributing to the long-term preservation of elephants. In November 1998, Michael invited nine representatives from zoos, private elephant facilities, circuses and a university to Fort Worth, Texas to discuss how a foundation could significantly enhance current conservation efforts. From this first organizational meeting the International Elephant Foundation was born. The IEF was incorporated in 1999."

  "text" : "1. Starting in 1936 as a small lathe shop in Lahore and emerging as the largest steel undertaking in Pakistan by 1971 known as Ittefaq Foundries, this Company was the flagship carrier of what came to be later known as the 'Ittefaq Group '. 2. Ittefaq Foundries also had sizeable operations in East Pakistan which fell victim to the fall of Dacca on 16 December 1971. Only two weeks later Ittefaq Foundries in Lahore was also nationalised with no compensation paid to owners. 3. 1972: The family set up a steel mills in UAE which it subsequently sold. 4. 1972-1977: Undeterred by a ruthless nationalization campaign, the family set up 5 industrial organizations in Pakistan within a short span of 18 months which includes Ittefaq Brothers,Ilyas Enterprises, Nawaz Shahbaz Enterprises, Javed Parvez Enterprises and Khalid Siraj Industries. 5. 1979: Ittefaq Foundries is denationalized and handed back to the family in ruins .Millions are spent again on the Foundries by the Ittefaq family to revamp and diversify the Organization. 6. 1980: Ittefaq Textile Mills set up. 7. 1982: Brothers Steel Mills, another steel unit comes into operation. 8. 1983: Ittefaq Sugar Mills commences production with most of its machinery manufactured by Ittefaq Foundries. 9. 1984-1989: 2 additional units of Ittefaq Textile Mills, Brothers Textile Mills, Khalid Siraj Textile Mills Ramzan Buksh Textiles Mills and Brothers Sugar Mills come into operation. Brothers Sugar Mills came into operation despite a loan embargo imposed by the PPP government courtesy the Government controlled Nationalised Commercial Banks. 10. 1989: Terror Struck. MV Jonathan carrying 30000 tons of Scrap for Ittefaq Foundries is held at the outer anchorage at Karachi for one whole year on Orders of the Federal Government in contemptuous violation of Orders of the Superior Judiciary. Operations at Ittefaq Foundries come to a reeling halt in 1990. This single action caused a loss of Rs 500 million to the Foundries. Employment of thousands of workers was placed on the altar in a venomous vendetta. Thousands others indirectly associated were faced with loss of livelihood. 11. The undivided Ittefaq Group continued till October 1990 and by then had become the largest industrial Group in Pakistan employing thousands and contributing billions to the national exchequer in terms of taxes, duties and other levies. 12. 1990: Ittefaq group led by late Mian Muhammad Sharif was voluntarily divided amongst the seven families as the third generation started to come of age. The steel companies were retained in a pool to be owned by all seven families while the rest of the group, consisting of sugar, textiles and other mills, was passed on to the families of the other six brothers with Mian Muhammad Sharif retaining only Ramzan Sugar Mills and a small textile weaving unit Khalid Siraj Industries Private Limited. Ramzan Sugar Mills later passed on to the family of Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif while the other two brothers Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Muhammad Abbas Sharif retained next to almost zilch of the 'Ittefaq Group'. 13. 1990-1993: With the Ittefaq Group divided, the Sharif Family set up Hudabiya Paper Mills, Hamza Board Mills, Chauudhry Sugar Mills, Hudabiya Engineering and a trust comprising a hospital, specialized educational institutions and a school. 14. 1994-1998: Terror struck again! With the PPP Government in power again at the Center in 1994,all financial facilities being availed by Ittefaq Foundries and its associated undertakings were arbitrarily withdrawn causing a procrastinated shutdown once again of all steel companies of the group including Ittefaq Foundries, Ittefaq Brothers and Brothers Steel. These companies were later disposed off to pay the entire loan liability of Rs 5.76 billion approximately with not a single penny of interest waiver ever received or ever sought. 15. With the steel companies sold off and with no shareholding in the former Ittefaq Group excepting Ramzan Sugar Mills which fell to the lot of the family of Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif, the family of Muhammad Nawaz Sharif was left with no commercial or industrial asset except Chaudhry Sugar Mills owned equally with the family of Mian Abbas Sharif. Hudabiya Paper, Hamza Board and Hudabiya Engineering had since long closed down on account of procrastinated political victimization by successively opposed political governments. 16. 1999-2016: General Pervez Musharraf imposed martial law on 12 October 1999 over throwing the government of Muhammad Nawaz Sharif. The Sharif family was incarcerated for 14 months and later exiled to Saudi Arabia for 7 years. The entire family was later acquitted."

  "text" : "IMRIS Inc. (Innovative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems) was a medical equipment company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States. The company which was originally founded in Winnipeg, Canada, developed and marketed intraoperative image-guided therapy environments for use during surgical or interventional procedures. The system – sold as VISIUS Surgical Theatre – integrated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), X-ray angiography and fluoroscopy into the operating room. The company evolved from research conducted through Canada’s National Research Council. The IMRIS intraoperative MRI and CT products were mounted on ceiling rails that brought the image modality (scanner) to the patient rather than having to transport or reposition the patient. The VISIUS iMRI and iCT products were available in multiple room configurations so imaging could be utilized in other rooms for intraoperative or diagnostic scanning. In 2011, the company announced it was developing an MRI-compatible image-guided surgical robot specifically designed for minimally-invasive neurosurgery. In November 2012, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters to the Minneapolis area. They completed their move in July 2013. In late May 2015, news broke that IMRIS had \"filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a buyout offer of $9.5 million from secured lender Deerfield Management Co. LP.\" due to problems competing with larger health care businesses. Chapter 11 proceedings were finalized on August 19, 2015, with Deerfield Imaging agreeing to acquire most of IMRIS' assets."

  "text" : "Inview Technology (Inview Technology Ltd or simply Inview) is a UK based digital TV software company. It specialises in advanced EPGs, interactive broadcast, IP services and solutions for Pay-TV and analogue switch off markets. Their OTT TV platform allows television broadcast and internet content to be simultaneously accessible to the viewer. The company is based in Northwich, Cheshire, UK and is privately owned. Inview have been involved in digital TV in the UK since the late 1990s, providing software for set-top boxes manufactured by Digifusion, Thomson and Sony, alongside the Teletext Extra EPG (later renamed Radio Times Extra). Nick Markham, Inview's Chairman, developed the concept of Freeview alongside the BBC and previously worked for Top-up TV. By late 2016, Inview were enabling digital switchover for whole countries such as Nigeria (started in June 2016) and which will provide a Freeview / Freesat type broadcasting platform and implement a BBC style licence fee system to 30 million TV households. Inview has also been awarded contracts by other countries undergoing Analogue Switch Off in Affrican, Asian and South American countries. Inview Technology was appointed in March 2015 by National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) (run by the Government) to enable digital switchover from analogue throughout the country; it will also provide a Conditional Access System, set-top box software and services including full EPG, Push Video-On-Demand, a range of broadcasting applications such as news, public service information and audience measurement services over the digital terrestrial and satellite networks in Nigeria. Within a year of signing the contract, set-up boxes, created by Inview, were being distributed in Jos by the NBC, to give an additional 30 free channels to the customer. One of Mexico's leading pay TV companies, Dish Mexico, has appointed Inview to provide an end to end DTH ecosystem and broadcast software and services that will allow Dish Mexico to create an improved user experience using a DTH set-top box system. Also in 2016 Inview was contracted to supply middleware for Cignal, the largest satellite provider in the Philippines, which enabled Cignal to directly communicate with their customers through an the user interface, Inview's new EPG and other services such as advertising. This is all supplied within Zapper satellite boxes. In 2014-5 their partners include Humax and Skyworth, China’s largest set-top box company, and silicon partners include Mstar and Broadcom. They have signed a deal with Pico Digital, Inc. to develop the next generation set-top box for the Latin American market, as well as Dish Mexico. Martin Edwards (Honorary Life President of Manchester United) and Koen Van Driel (ex-CEO of Thomson and Grundig Set Top Box Divisions) joined the Board of Directors in February 2014. In early 2016 Angélique Boissy, formerly manager at Skyworth and UTStarcom was appointed SVP Global Sales & Alliances, Raza Ansari became SVP, Asia Pacific and Diego Martinez spearheads the Americas."

  "text" : "Irish Water Ltd. (Irish: Uisce Éireann) is a water utility company in Ireland. The company was created by the Irish Government through the Water Services Act (2013), which formally created Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis, to provide \"safe, clean and affordable water and waste water services\" to water users in Ireland. Water and wastewater services were previously provided by local authorities in Ireland. Public concerns on operational, documentation, company responsiveness, data security, financial and perceived wasteful spending issues were highlighted throughout the initial months of the subsidiary's operations. Together with privatisation fears, these public concerns resulted in a significant volume of unreturned application forms, large nationwide protests and pressure on company management and the government during 2014. In 2015, the scale of non-payment issues, and an unfavourable assessment of the viability of the organisation as an independent entity further increased attention and calls by some to dissolve the organisation. The viability of the utility was also a feature ahead of the 2016 general election, and post-election discussions on government formation. Irish Water is accountable to two regulatory bodies, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is the economic regulator for the water industry, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which is the environmental regulator."

Immudex specializes in the production of MHC Dextramers. MHC Dextramers are chemical reagents that are designed to detect antigen-specific T cells. All Immudex products, whether on the marked or in development, are based on its proprietary MHC Dextramer technology. The use of MHC Dextramers offers a new method to accurately detect and quantify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. While some of the technology is currently only sold for Research use only (RUO), clinical applications are being actively pursued. Currently, Immudex has several development projects for clinically applicable MHC Dextramers. Even so, the first MHC Dextramers clinical reagent has been developed and approved for clinical in vitro diagnostics in Europe. Namely the CE-marked kit for enumeration of cytomegalovirus-specific T cells. Immudex primarily focuses on the identification of producing large quantities of CD8+ T cells by the means of MHC class I molecules. Even so, the research and development into the application of MHC class II Dextramers might expand the technology."

  "text" : "Isuzu Astra Motor Indonesia (IAMI) is a joint venture automobile and commercial vehicle manufacturer with headquarters in Jakarta, Indonesia. The company was founded in April 2008 and is the successor of the previous Isuzu manufacturer, Pantja Engine, founded in May 1974. The new company is jointly owned by Isuzu and the holding company Astra International, each holding a 44.94% share in the company, with the remaining stake of 10.12% belonging to the Indonesian Product Exhibition. Under the leadership of President Prijono Sugiarto, the company manufacturers up to 75,000 units a year. The majority of the products are for export to the markets of Thailand, the Philippines and China. After nearly two years of construction, the new plant was opened in the summer of 1976. Isuzu Gemini and Isuzu Florian were present as the entry-level models. In the commercial vehicle sector, it ranked the brand new model of Isuzu Elf and the Isuzu Forward, here ever since sold as the  Isuzu Borneo. The first SUV was manufactured in 1980, Isuzu P'up, a sister model of the Japanese Isuzu Faster. The model soon became very popular and was especially successful as an export. The Isuzu Trooper, which since 1988 in Indonesia has been built. On the local market, the Isuzu Panther was a serious competitor for the Toyota Kijang. As an export model for the People's Republic of China, it had the name Isuzu Leopard. On the Thai market, the Isuzu Cameo and Isuzu Spark were built. These rolled off the assembly line in Indonesia. The second generation Spark was based on the Isuzu Rodeo, sold under the name Isuzu Rodeo 4WD model. They also marketed the Isuzu TF. In the commercial vehicle sector in 1997, then the Isuzu C Series was included. This is the only heavy-duty truck model of Isuzu's in the Indonesian market. In 1999 started the engine Pantja, and their cooperation with the vehicle tuner Otomotif Berita Indonesia, where the production of body parts and assemblies for the then called Berita-Isuzu Elf took over. From 2002 Isuzu then delivered chassis, engine, transmission and the interior of the Panthers to the company. As they arrived at the factory, the kits were built with body parts of the Hummer H2 provided. Technically, there is thus no match for the American version of the model of AM General. However, the 2007 model had the Isuzu Bison soft, which is available both as a flatbed as well as minibus. The Bison is currently the most successful model Isuzu's in Indonesia. Since its founding in April 2008, the Isuzu Astra Motor Indonesia company dissolved their venture with Berita. The Berita-Isuzu Elf is still very much in demand. The 2011 facelift to replace the current version and any later be available for other works also via CKD and SKD kits. Only since 2009, there are in Indonesia the world's most popular PickUp Isuzu D-Max. At the same time ran the installation of sport utility vehicles Isuzu MU-7. The latter has since been removed from production. Rumors of the press were in late 2009 suggests incorrectly that the MU-7 was intended to replace the already obsolete Panther."

  "text" : "ISOTX was a Dutch independent video game developer founded by Vincent van Geel and Byron Rupp in 2005. In 2014 Vincent van Geel left the company. The company continued on, yet dissolved in 2016. Their first release was the MidEast Crisis mod for C&C Generals. This was followed by Iron Grip: The Oppression, a mod for Half-Life 2. Since Iron Grip: The Oppression, nearly all ISOTX games have been set in the Iron Grip Universe; a dieselpunk alternative reality setting. In 2008 ISOTX released their first commercial game, Iron Grip: Warlord, which received somewhat mixed reviews. IGN only gave the game 4.5/10, but other smaller websites gave more positive reviews. The gameplay in Iron Grip: Warlord offered a mix of first person shooter and tower defense gameplay. While defending against waves of attacking enemies, players had to hunt down enemy officers to reduce enemy morale and win the battle. In 2012, ISOTX released the Scorched Earth DLC for Iron Grip: Warlord on Steam, which added new weapons, enemies, and a deathmatch game mode The next game released by ISOTX was the free-to-play strategy MMO Iron Grip: Lords of Atelia, which would later be renamed to Iron Grip: Lords of War. In 2011, ISOTX launched the open beta of their second free-to-play strategy MMO, Iron Grip: Marauders, which featured 3D turn-based battles using the Unity game engine. The game was released through Steam, an online distributor, as part of their Free to Play catalog on September 30, 2011. Iron Grip: Marauders became available on Amazon.com through their Games Connect feature in 2012. Marauders has received a number of significant updates, often changing gameplay or other major features. It received a notable visual upgrade on March 18, 2011. To highlight the 3D capabilities of the game, the developers changed the view from an isometric camera to a perspective camera and added a zoom function to allow players to look more closely at units and structures. The developers also upgraded the internal Unity engine from 2.7 to 3.0, with plans to make use of the new engine's capabilities to add lighting effects and more detailed terrain maps in later patches. The \"Boss Smash Patch\" released in May 2011 included a day and night cycle, more units, avatar customization, and bosses which randomly attack players. Other changes include a base building system where players could place structures and units to produce income and defend the base (this was later removed), the introduction of a smuggling system, and more recently an assault system where players could pick units to go on an automated 10‑minute battle. In April 2012, ISOTX partnered with QINQO, meaning that people in Belgium and the Netherlands could buy in-game currency from shops in the form of prepaid QINQO cards. In March 2013 ISOTX revealed their new project, a free online multiplayer game, March of War. It's going to be a F2P strategic, turn-based episodic multiplayer world war online game for PC, Mac and iOS/Android.  March of War takes places in an alternate dieselpunk influenced 1940 world, where democratically elected players lead six warring factions through the turn-based episodic struggle for world domination. It's the world's first episodic free-to-play game based on the TV series model. The game promises over 80 units and 60 maps with four gameplay modes. Every month a new episode is released bringing a number of new features to the game."

The company's three divisions include distribution services, rights services, and INresidence, an artist services division. They utilize a proprietary distribution system and maintain a focus on analytics, and reporting technology. The company was founded in San Francisco in 2002. Envisioned as a digital record label of the future, it was one of the first independent distribution companies to partner with iTunes. As of 2015, the INgrooves retail network included more than 600 services and storefronts. In 2008, Universal Music Group (UMG) selected INgrooves's parent company, Isolation Network Inc., to digitally distribute all of its music in North America. In 2010, Shamrock Capital -- an investment fund founded by Roy E. Disney -- made a significant investment in the company, which allowed INgrooves to acquire Fontana Distribution in 2012. INgrooves subsequently expanded its services to include physical distribution. In 2012, the company launched an Artist Services division, INresidence, a project-based service for established artists and emerging artists releasing music independently. They established a Rights Services division dedicated to music publishing, synch licensing and neighboring rights in 2013.

Murray and Daniel Gray researched the metal called indium, hoping they would find some new ways to commercialize the metal. After several years of trial and error, they discovered methods for obtaining indium and how to change it chemically. The first breakthrough was in 1934 when the company developed indium plating for aircraft engine bearings. In the mid to late 1970s, the Huari Huari zinc mine was the principal source of indium for Indium Corporation"

  "text" : "International Business Machines Corporation (commonly referred to as IBM) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924. IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and offers hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most patents generated by a business (as of 2016) for 23 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). IBM has continually shifted its business mix by exiting commoditizing markets and focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and selling off its personal computer (ThinkPad) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), and The Weather Company (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go \"fabless\", continuing to design semiconductors but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries. Nicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as \"IBMers\", IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology and five National Medals of Science."

  "text" : "International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets. The company is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items. Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest hats. By the 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats. During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation. After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Molding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities. On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community. After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary. In 1989, International Hat was subsequently sold to Paramount Cap Company, in a liquidation fire sale. In an attempt to avoid a hostile takeover bid by Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to sell Interco's entire apparel division between 1988 and 1990. This divestiture strategy was part of a larger $2.8 billion recapitalization plan, put in place in 1988, that led the parent company directly into insolvency. Some financial scholars have considered this recapitalization plan to be among the worst business strategies in the US of the 1980s. In 1991, Interco's earlier attempt to avoid a hostile takeover resulted in the bankruptcy of the company. Several tens of thousands of jobs were lost across the country, as a consequence. Although International Hat was liquidated in 1989, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri. Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places. International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976. It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility."

  "text" : "The International Council of Management Consulting Institutes has since 1987 been the professional body worldwide for management consultants. It exists to: \n*  Elevate the standards of management consultants worldwide \n*  Increase the acceptance and respect of the management consulting profession \n*  Increase the international and regional profile of management consulting \n*  Improve the process of certification throughout the world \n*  Provide a forum for national certifying bodies of management consultants \n*  Prepare and promulgate Standards for management consulting to be adopted internationally The practice of management consulting is about \"helping organizations to improve their performance, operating primarily through the analysis of existing organizational problems and the development of plans for improvement.\" with the purpose of \"gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and access to the consultants' specialized expertise.\" It follows therefore that there is scope for an international organization to promote and foster competence in the management consulting profession. ICMCI has demonstrated that indigenous, competent, professional management consultants add capacity and capability to an economy. Others have shown that on average the achieved benefits of management consultancy assignments are at least three times the fees charged. Research has shown that: \n* Indigenous competent professional management consultants add capacity and capability to an economy (and in developing economies can increase the success of development projects) \n* Management consultants build a country's competitiveness by speeding and making more effective the implementation of new management techniques and organisational improvements \n* A successful cadre of professional management consultants aids the improvement of the management profession in a country Developed economies tend to have about one management consultant per one thousand total population whereas developing economies have one for every two thousand. On this basis there are between 2.5m and 3m people who refer to themselves as management consultants in the world. ICMCI Member Institutes represent countries in all continents that include between 85% and 90% of the world's management consultants."

The data that users collect is stored on import.io’s cloud servers and can be downloaded as CSV, Excel, Google Sheets or JSON and shared. Users can also generate an API from the data allowing them to easily integrate live web data into their own applications or third party analytics and visualization software. For more technical users, import.io offers real-time data retrieval through JSON REST-based and streaming APIs, integration with several common programming languages and data manipulation tools, as well as a federation platform which allows up to 100 data sources to be queried simultaneously."

Its cheeses were also named a “Best Artisanal Cheese” in Food & Wine magazine in 2016 and one of “The 49 Best American Cheeses” in Men’s Journal magazine. Unlike conventionally managed dairy animals raised primarily on grain diets for the production of most commercially available cheeses, Idyll Farms’ certified-humane Alpine goats are pasture-fed using rotational grazing practices which mimic and harness nature's complex, productive processes. Idyll Farms is owned and operated by hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel, who built the sustainable farm after acquiring its approximately 200 acres in 2010 in his hometown."

  "text" : "Index Fund Advisors (IFA) is a registered investment advisor (RIA) headquartered in Irvine, California, with representatives in several locations across the United States. The company was founded on March 5, 1999 by Mark T. Hebner, former president of nuclear pharmacy company Syncor International, with the goal of providing online automated investment adviser services, with a personal touch as needed, while also providing educational material regarding investing to the general public through the website IFA.com. IFA offers high-net-worth individuals, 401k plans, 403b plans, foundations, and endowments of an expanding range of advisory services that are consistent with IFA’s investment strategy of passive management. Heavily influenced by the works of Nobel Laureates Eugene Fama, Harry Markowitz, Paul Samuelson, William F. Sharpe, Merton Miller, Daniel Kahneman and Friedrich von Hayek, IFA advises clients to invest in low-cost index mutual funds, such as those provided by Dimensional Fund Advisors, Vanguard or Blackrock's iShares. Additionally, IFA offers advice on faith-based and sustainable investments, through its IFAsustainable.com and InvestingforCatholics.com sites. IFA pioneered the idea of the Robo-Advisor when it first published their website on November 9, 1999 as indexfundsadvisors.com, then IFA.tv and finally as IFA.com. Mark Hebner pioneered the business model of a low-cost online Registered Investment Adviser which would provide an online algorithm-based risk capacity survey designed to match individual investors with one of several index portfolios. These portfolios have always been implemented exclusively with index funds. The process of becoming an IFA client has not required face to face meetings and there has been minimal human intervention. IFA was among the first RIAs to offer an online live advisor camera (streaming video and NetMeeting) and live chat. Since 1999, IFA clients have been offered portfolio rebalancing, tax loss harvesting, tax-management, asset location, extensive online education and historical index and index portfolio risk and return data. In 2012, IFA built its own in-house TV studio and produces videos that are published on iTunes, YouTube, Roku, and IFA.tv (352 videos as of August 2016). One of the world's largest private collections of financial books can be found at IFA, with about 2,494 books dating back to 1648. The books are catalogued and displayed on IFA.com. Mark Hebner is also the author of Index Funds: The 12-Step Recovery Program for Active Investors, a book on behavioral finance, the failure of active management and the advantages of passive investing. The book was first published in 2005 and its latest update was published in 2015. Together these various media endeavors advance Hebner's mission to get investors all over the world to stop actively investing their investment portfolios. IFA’s investing philosophy is based on Nobel prize-winning academic and empirical research, including the efficient-market hypothesis, multi-factor asset pricing models, such as the Fama-French Three-Factor Model and more generally modern portfolio theory. IFA rejects the investment strategies generally known as active management. These strategies include stock picking, market timing, manager selection and tactical asset allocation. IFA reached $2.87 billion in assets under management on June 30, 2016."

  "text" : "Indie Rights, Inc. is an American distributor of independent films, based in Los Angeles, California. Indie Rights is a subsidiary of Nelson Madison Films and was incorporated in 2007 to act as distributor for other independent filmmakers. The corporation began as a private MySpace group where the makers of independent films could get information about the changing face of film distribution; founders Linda Nelson and Michael Madison created Indie Rights so that distribution contracts could be signed by a legal entity. The corporation distributes films largely through video on demand services, though more recently it has overseen such theatrical releases as We Are Kings and Fray, both in 2014. Nelson Madison Films has produced three features: Bigger Than Live (2002), Shifted (2006) and Delivered (2011)."

As of March 31, 2014, Inland American had 183,000, predominantly \"mom-and-pop investors.\" Formed in 2004, Inland American owns commercial real estate in the following asset classes: lodging, multi-tenant retail, and student housing. The firm is a non-traded REIT, which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange. The shares are therefore relatively illiquid. Shares were sold through broker-dealers. While original investors bought in at $10/share, Inland American estimated its shares had a value of $4.00. In March 2014, the firm announced that functions performed by its external, related-party managers would now be performed by the REIT itself. The firm has charged its investors over $1.4 billion in fees and expenses to pay for services provided by these external, related-party managers. It has also been observed that Inland American “bought a lot of property at the height of the market.\""
