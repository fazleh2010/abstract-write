  "text" : "You Only Live Twice is the eleventh novel (and twelfth book) in Ian Fleming's James Bond series of stories. It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 26 March 1964 and sold out quickly. The book holds the distinction of being the last novel by Fleming to be published in his lifetime, with subsequent works being published posthumously. You Only Live Twice is the concluding chapter in what is known as the \"Blofeld Trilogy\". The story starts eight months after the murder of Tracy Bond, which occurred at the end of the previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. James Bond is drinking and gambling heavily and making mistakes on his assignments when, as a last resort, he is sent to Japan on a semi-diplomatic mission. Whilst there he is challenged by the Head of the Japanese Secret Service to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Bond realises that Shatterhand is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and sets out on a revenge mission to kill him and his wife, Irma Bunt. The novel deals on a personal level with the change in Bond from a depressed man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the mouths of his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post-World War II British power and influence, notably in relation to the United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre-orders in the UK totalling 62,000; critics were more muted in their reactions, generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper and Playboy magazine, and also adapted for comic strip format in the Daily Express. In 1967, it was released as the fifth entry in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, starring Sean Connery as Bond. The novel has also been adapted as a radio play and broadcast on the BBC."

Though it contains three short stories, it is mostly known for its first story, \"Yertle the Turtle\", in which the eponymous Yertle, king of the pond, stands on his subjects in an attempt to reach higher than the moon—until the bottom turtle burps and he falls into the mud, ending his rule. Though the book included \"burp\", a word then considered to be relatively rude, it was a success upon publication, and has since sold over a million copies. In 2001, it was listed at 125 on the Publishers Weekly list of the best-selling children's books of all time."

  "text" : "You're Only Old Once! A Book for Obsolete Children is a 1986 picture book for adults by Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel). Released on Geisel's eighty-second birthday, the book follows an elderly man on a visit to the Golden Years Clinic, where he endures long waits and bizarre medical tests. You're Only Old Once! was written shortly after Geisel had suffered through a series of illnesses, during which he spent a considerable amount of time in hospital waiting rooms. To pass the time, he began sketching images of hospital machines and scenes of medical procedures. He later began to work those ideas into a book. Geisel quipped that he was \"fed up with a social life consisting entirely of doctors\". You're Only Old Once! was Seuss's first adult book since The Seven Lady Godivas, which was published in 1939. The Seven Lady Godivas sold fewer than 500 copies when it was first released, but You're Only Old Once! reached #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers List, and remained on the list for over 60 weeks. The book's subtitle, \"A Book for Obsolete Children\" refers to a quote by Dr. Seuss describing why he did not enjoy writing for adults. After the failure of \"The Seven Lady Godivas\", Seuss said in an interview, \"Adults are just obsolete children, and the hell with them.\""

Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically."

  "text" : "Yondering is a collection of short stories by American author Louis L'Amour, published in 1980. A departure from L'Amour's traditional subject matter of the Old West, Yondering contains a mix of adventure stories and character studies, primarily set in the first half of the 20th century. Two of them are set during the World War II era, with many of the stories drawing upon the author's own life experiences. The book's publication celebrated the milestone of L'Amour having an estimated 100 million books in print at that time of publication. A limited leather-bound hardcover edition was available direct from Bantam Books at the time of the first paperback publication in 1980. The book was revised in 1989, with the primary difference the inclusion of some of L'Amour's previously unpublished short stories in a similar vein ; \"Ruins of El Walarieh,\" \"And Proudly Die,\" Show Me The Way Home,\" and \"So You Want Adventure.\" Excised was a \"The Moon of the Trees Broken by Snow: A Christmas Story\" which, according to the author's son Beau L'Amour, \"never really belonged in this book.\""

It is notable for Wang Lixiong's politics, a Chinese dissident and outspoken activist, its publication following Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and its popularity due to bootleg distribution across China even when the book was banned by the Communist Party of China. The book was published in 1991 by Mirror Books, a Chinese editor in Toronto, Canada, and soon became a best-seller."

Australian singer John Farnham recorded the song for his album Whispering Jack released in 1986. The song was awarded the 1987 ARIA Award for \"Single of the Year\". The song was one of the biggest hits of 1986 in Australia, topping the Kent Music Report Singles Chart for seven weeks from 3 November to 21 December. It is also one of Farnham's biggest international successes, reaching the top 10 in the UK and many continental European countries, as well as the top 20 in Canada. In the US, the track performed relatively poorly, missing the chart on its initial 1987 issue. BMG/RCA rereleased the song in the US in February 1990 after Farnham made the Adult Contemporary charts with \"Two Strong Hearts\". Farnham's version eventually spent eight weeks on the US charts, peaking at No. 82, but in the US the song is probably best known for a charting version issued by Heart in 1991."

Banks' Union Army of the Gulf marched out of Berwick, Louisiana. Their destination was Texas, their intended route was across the prairies of south-western Louisiana, and their objective was to restore Texas to the Union. The Federals did not make it to Texas but by November 17 were marching back into New Iberia, having gotten no farther than Opelousas. They found their march harassed by swarms of Texas and Louisiana cavalrymen belonging to Major General Richard Taylor's Army of Western Louisiana. The two armies engaged in numerous skirmishes, most of them inconclusive, along the way and fought one real battle. Texans under Brigadier General Tom Green won the Battle of Bayou Bourbeux and almost destroyed an enemy brigade."

  "text" : "You Can't Go Home Again is a novel by Thomas Wolfe published posthumously in 1940, extracted by his editor, Edward Aswell, from the contents of his vast unpublished manuscript The October Fair. The novel tells the story of George Webber, a fledgling author, who writes a book that makes frequent references to his home town of Libya Hill. The book is a national success but the residents of the town, unhappy with what they view as Webber's distorted depiction of them, send the author menacing letters and death threats. Wolfe, as in many of his other novels, explores the changing American society of the 1920s/30s, including the stock market crash, the illusion of prosperity, and the unfair passing of time which prevents Webber ever being able to return \"home again\". In parallel to Wolfe's relationship with America, the novel details his disillusionment with Germany during the rise of Nazism. Wolfe scholar Jon Dawson argues that the two themes are connected most firmly by Wolfe's critique of capitalism and comparison between the rise of capitalist enterprise in the United States in the 1920s and the rise of fascism in Germany during the same period. The artist Alexander Calder appears, fictionalized as \"Piggy Logan.\""

  "text" : "Years of Grace is a 1930 novel by Margaret Ayer Barnes. It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1931. Despite this, it is not her most well-known work; that honor belongs to Dishonored Lady, a play she co-wrote with Edward Sheldon, which was adapted twice into film (first as Letty Lynton and later with its actual title). Barnes' alma mater, Bryn Mawr College, along with the characters of college presidents M. Carey Thomas and Marion Park figure prominently in this work. The story, beginning in the 1890s and continuing into the 1930s', chronicles the life of Jane Ward Carver from her teens to age fifty-four. This novel follows many of the same themes as Barnes' other works. Centering on the social manners of upper middle class society, her female protagonists are often traditionalists, struggling to uphold conventional morality in the face of changing social climates."

It is narrated by Charles Marlow who is also the narrator of Lord Jim, Chance, and Heart of Darkness. The narrator's introduction suggests this is the first time, chronologically, the character Marlow appears in Conrad's works (the Author comments that he thinks Marlow spells his name this way)."

The first edition was reprinted in England in 1962 under the same title. A second edition was published in 1971, with new illustrations reflecting NASA's Project Apollo. This was reprinted in England in 1973 under the title Going to the Moon. The book is a children's story in the \"Beginners Books\" series, written using a restricted vocabulary of simple words for a readership age of six. The illustrations show a lunar mission concept based on the Von Braun and Ley space exploration concepts of 1952 (see Man Will Conquer Space Soon!), featuring wingèd three-stage rockets ferrying the passengers to a rotating-wheel space station, serving as a transfer station to the spider-like lunar surface shuttle. The writing is unusual in that it is written in the second-person future tense."

  "text" : "You've Got to Have a Dream: The Message of the Musical is a book written by the British theologian Ian Bradley, first published in 2004, exploring the spiritual dimension of musical theatre. In his study, Bradley includes works with an overt religious subject matter, for example, Godspell, Jesus Christ Superstar and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat as well looking at musicals such as Les Misérables, The Lion King and Carousel. His thesis is that Churches have a great deal to learn from modern musicals and could usefully incorporate their spiritual and theological values, and the pastoral care they offer, into their services. The title \"You've Got to Have a Dream\" is a reference to a line in the popular song Happy Talk in the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical South Pacific. Published in September 2004, the book predates the protests and controversy surrounding the BBC broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera in January 2005, which was strongly opposed by organisations such as Christian Voice and the Christian Institute, which attempted to bring a private prosecution against the BBC."

  "text" : "Young Royals is a series of novels for children by Carolyn Meyer based on the early lives of multiple royalties such as English and French royalty. Books in the series mostly include the English Tudors such as Mary, Bloody Mary (1999), Beware, Princess Elizabeth (2001), Doomed Queen Anne (2002) and Patience, Princess Catherine (2004). The French books are Duchessina (2007) about the life of Catherine de' Medici and The Bad Queen: Rules and Instructions for Marie-Antoinette (2010). The latest books in the series are Cleopatra Confesses (2011) about Cleopatra who however is an adult, The Wild Queen: The Days and Nights of Mary, Queen of Scots (2012) and the English Victoria Rebels (2013) about Queen Victoria. Each book mostly features inside-looks at what the lives of each girl would have been like, including daily routine, protocol, out-of-the-ordinary experiences, and first-hand views of the lives of the people surrounding each of them. Each book portrays one character as a villain, whereas in a different book that same character is the heroine. The portrayal of each royal is biased according to the position of the observing royal and it provides an interesting window into the life of royalty."

  "text" : "Yankee in Oz is a 1972 Oz novel by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was the first published by The International Wizard of Oz Club. A letter from the Henry Regnery Company, which bought Reilly & Lee, is reproduced in the front indicating the publisher's blessing for the new Oz book to appear. It was originally written in 1959, but because the Oz books were not selling, it was not published. The first two editions of the book were published in 8½ x 11 inch format and running only 94 pages. This was done at the request of illustrator Dick Martin to reduce the number of required illustrations and to show them closer to the actual size they were drawn. The second printing (1986) featured a new cover, with the first edition artwork reprinted preceding the title page. The third printing (2007) is standard Oz book size. Its cover is a gaudier redesign of the second edition cover. The book also features maps by James E. Haff, and as such, Thompson correctly places the Winkie Country in the west of Oz."

But Phillips, after psychiatric examination, can’t remember a large blank in her life. Slowly she begins to realize that she was hypnotized, and that she must find the culprit to get her life back. The author has said that she wrote the novel in two weeks, in a deliberate attempt to see how fast a novel could be written. She was pleased with the result, saying that \"Doubleday accepted the book without a murmur... it stands up to re-reading, which is always the acid test.\""

  "text" : "Young West: A Sequel to Edward Bellamy's Celebrated Novel \"Looking Backward\" is an 1894 utopian novel, written by Solomon Schindler, radical rabbi of Boston. As its subtitle indicates, the book was one of the many responses and sequels to Edward Bellamy's famous 1888 novel Looking Backward, and was one volume in the major wave of utopian and dystopian writing that distinguished the later nineteenth century. Schindler had earlier translated Looking Backward into German (1890). His sequel was printed by the Arena Publishing Company, a prominent radical house of the 1890s; Schindler and publisher B. O. Flower served together on the board of directors of the American Psychical Society. Flower was responsible for one curious aspect of the book's first edition: he believed that the black-on-white contrast of standard printing caused eyestrain, and decided that the pages of Young West would have colored margins, in blue, green, and yellow. Schindler's sequel follows upon the plot of Bellamy's original: protagonist Julian West marries heroine Edith Lette, and they soon have a son. Yet West senior dies only two years after his awakening in the year 2000; \"Schindler's fictional response was in many ways more sophisticated than the responses of most twentieth-century critics who ignore or downplay West's anguish at the conclusion of Looking Backward.\" Schindler's book follows the development of the son, \"young West,\" from early youth to eventual triumph, when, after a rigorous campaign, he wins election to the presidency of the United States. Schindler's book diverges from Bellamy's original, in that where Bellamy placed strong emphasis on religion, Schindler's attitude is agnostic. (Schindler had already moved away from traditional Judaism; after a brief flirtation with spiritualism around 1892, he became a firm skeptic.) Bellamy thought that socialism would arise first in America, while Schindler expected Europe to be first; he foresaw the weakening of European nationalism and wholesale intermarriage among Europeans. Schindler's book helps to illustrate the wide reach of the utopian literature of its era. While many books in the genre were authored by White Anglo-Saxon Protestant males, other works were created by Jewish, Irish (Ignatius Donnelly's Caesar's Column and The Golden Bottle), and African-American (Sutton E. Griggs's Imperium in Imperio) writers, and by a number of women."

A Sefer Torah, the holiest book within Judaism venerated by Jews, was reassembled by prisoners from manuscripts unearthed at the Lwów's Jewish cemetery. Following World War II it was smuggled out of the then Soviet Union, and brought to Los Angeles. It has been donated to the rabbinical programs at Hebrew Union College, where it is taken on tour to various synagogues and assemblies, so that the story of its history can be told."

  "text" : "Your Heart Belongs to Me is a novel by science fiction/horror writer Dean Koontz. The plot revolves around Ryan Perry, who receives a heart transplant. From the #1 New York Times bestselling master of suspense comes a riveting thriller that probes the deepest terrors of the human psyche—and the ineffable mystery of what truly makes us who we are. Here a brilliant young man finds himself fighting for his very existence in a battle that starts with the most frightening words of all… At thirty-four, Internet entrepreneur Ryan Perry seemed to have the world in his pocket—until the first troubling symptoms appeared out of nowhere. Within days, he’s diagnosed with incurable cardiomyopathy and finds himself on the waiting list for a heart transplant; it’s his only hope, and it’s dwindling fast. Ryan is about to lose it all…his health, his girlfriend Samantha, and his life. One year later, Ryan has never felt better. Business is good and he hopes to renew his relationship with Samantha. Then the unmarked gifts begin to appear—a box of Valentine candy hearts, a heart pendant. Most disturbing of all, a graphic heart surgery video and the chilling message: Your heart belongs to me. In a heartbeat, the medical miracle that gave Ryan a second chance at life is about to become a curse worse than death. For Ryan is being stalked by a mysterious woman who feels entitled to everything he has. She’s the spitting image of the twenty-six-year-old donor of the heart beating steadily in Ryan’s own chest. And she’s come to take it back."

  "text" : "Yellow Star is a 2006 biographical children's novel by Jennifer Roy. Written in free verse, it depicts life through the eyes of a young Jewish girl whose family was forced into the Łódź Ghetto in 1939 during World War II. Roy tells the story of her aunt Syvia, who shared her childhood memories with Roy more than 50 years after the ghetto's liberation. Roy added fictionalized dialogue, but did not otherwise alter the story. The book covers Syvia's life as she grows from four and a half to ten years old in the ghetto. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and her younger cousin Isaac were three of only twelve children who survived. After the war, Syvia moved to the United States, married, and only much later told her story to Roy. Since its publication in 2006, the book has received multiple awards, starred reviews, and other accolades, and has been made into a likewise well-received audiobook."

  "text" : "You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation is a 1990 non-fiction book on language and gender by Deborah Tannen, a professor of sociolinguistics at Georgetown University. It draws partly on academic research by Tannen and others, but is written for a popular audience, and thus uses anecdotes from literature and the lives of Tannen and her family, students and friends. Tannen writes that, from childhood, boys and girls learn different approaches to language and communication—Tannen calls these different approaches \"genderlects.\" Females engage in \"rapport-talk\" — a communication style meant to promote social affiliation and emotional connection, while men engage in \"report-talk\" — a style focused on exchanging information with little emotional import. The differences in metamessages, Tannen shows, result in misunderstandings between men and women. The book remained on the New York Times best seller list for nearly four years (8 months at No.1) and was subsequently translated into 30 other languages. It received generally positive reviews, and some readers have even credited it with helping save their relationships. Some other linguists, however, have criticized Tannen's representation of the research she cites and faulted her for ascribing the effects of inequities in social power to mere differences in language."

The title is a reference to the popular \"No Means No\" campaign against date rape.

  "text" : "Ylana of Callisto is a science fiction novel written by Lin Carter, the seventh in his Callisto series. It was first published in paperback by Dell Books in October 1977. Its working title was evidently Jungle Maid of Callisto, as announced in Locus #198, January 30, 1977; the title actually used appears to be a nod to that of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Llana of Gathol, a book in the Barsoom series that inspired Carter's Callisto books. The actual character of Ylana, however, was established in Mind Wizards of Callisto, an earlier volume in the series. The novel includes an appendix (\"The Men of Thanator\") collating background information from this and previous volumes."

It was one of the first psychobiographies of a famous historical figure. Erikson found in Martin Luther a good model of his discovery of \"the identity crisis\". Erikson was sure he could explain Luther's spontaneous eruption, during a monastery choir practice, \"I am not!\" According to Erikson, Luther suffered through an environment that fomented crisis, and succeeded in a healthy resolution, thereby becoming more fulfilled than if the crisis had not been experienced. In the endLuther chose the obedient, provincial leadership path his father had wished for him, rather than the national fame he could have easily pursued after his celebrity and wealth, but only after Luther had disobeyed and suffered many years in an identity crisis."

  "text" : "You Can't Lead With Your Feet on the Desk: Building Relationships, Breaking Down Barriers, and Delivering Profits (ISBN 0-470-87961-0) is a book by Edwin D. Fuller, first published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. in 2011. In \"You Can't Lead With Your Feet on the Desk\", Fuller offers insight into how he and his small team of “pioneers” built Marriott International into a leading global hotel chain, expanding overseas business from 16 hotels in six countries, grossing $325 million, to nearly 400 properties across 70 countries with $7B in revenues. J. W. Marriott, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Marriott International authored the foreword, stating “Ed shares scores of personal anecdotes from a 40-year corporate career, along with those of other leaders, that illustrate how deep personal relationships built on mutual respect and trust, and nurtured over time, can save a volatile business deal, inspire team members to greatness, ensure service excellence, bridge cultural divides, and create a long-term, profitable business.” Edwin Fuller writes, “And my 10-million-plus miles have taught me a lot about the value of getting out from behind my desk and building relationships that span cultural differences.” He goes on to point out that “For any manager, knowledge of other cultures makes it easier to navigate the complexities of today’s multicultural workplace.” Fuller refers to his “10-million-plus miles,” which is actual air travel miles. The book is based on knowledge and information he gathered while traveling extensively to lead global expansion of Marriott International, Inc. during the 90s and 2000s. In August 2012, the book was published in Japanese and in 2014, it was published in Mandarin Chinese. You Can’t Lead with Your Feet on the Desk provides details on the following: \n* Build relationships through mutual respect  \n* Earn trust quickly by delivering during a crisis  \n* Understand how verbal and nonverbal cues can make or break a deal  \n* Lead from the front and be willing to give yourself the tough jobs  \n* Learn the local customs and history in order to create positive relationships"

Whether they are landing in the middle of the M1 or at a maximum security jail, Tony and his crew Helimed 999 are the first on the scene in the most critical of emergencies.\""

Completed in 1798, the chronicle was the first attempt by the Konbaung court to update and check the accuracy of Maha Yazawin, the standard chronicle of the previous Toungoo Dynasty. Its author Twinthin Taikwun Maha Sithu consulted several existing written sources, and over 600 stone inscriptions collected from around the kingdom between 1783 and 1793. It is the first historical document in Southeast Asia compiled in consultation with epigraphic evidence. The chronicle updates the events up to 1785, and contains several corrections and critiques of earlier chronicles. However, the chronicle was not well received, and ultimately rejected by the king and the court who found the critiques of earlier chronicles excessively harsh. It became known as A-pe-gan Yazawin (အပယ်ခံ ရာဇဝင်, the \"Discarded Chronicle\"). Nonetheless, when Hmannan Yazawin, the first officially accepted chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty, appeared in 1832, it had incorporated many of Yazawin Thit's corrections, in particular regnal dates of Pagan period kings. Modern scholarship notes the chronicle's innovative use of epigraphy but does not find the chronicle's criticisms harsh. Rather, scholarship maintains that for its criticisms and corrections, the chronicle largely retains traditional narratives, and \"was —as elsewhere in the world —written with didactic intentions\". It remains one of the lesser known chronicles today."

It is notable for becoming popular enough to initiate a consumer protection movement. Soon after publication, its authors founded Consumers' Research, the organization which employed the founders of Consumers Union/Consumer Reports. The book was a protest against marketing practices which made it difficult for consumers to be able to judge the value of products. It analyzed the ways in which Americans made purchase decisions and gave measurements of the extent to which products could serve the purpose which manufacturer claims stated that they could. The authors requested an “extension of the principle of buying goods according to impartial scientific tests rather than according to the fanfare and trumpets of the higher salesmanship.”"

It is suggested that Yankee Pasha is probably Marshall's best-known work and one of the most popular. Yankee Pasha was indeed very popular and have seen seven different editions with many separate printings between 1947 and 1975 in the U.S.A. and Europe. Upon initial publication, the book received positive reviews including that of Fletcher Pratt, the American writer particularly noted for his works on naval history, that appeared in the December 6, 1947 issue of the Saturday Review. As in most of the novels of Edison Marshall, readers informed about local history and names can see references to his past life in Oregon in Yankee Pasha. One of the paperback covers of the book was realized by the American realist artist James Bama and another one was made by famous paperback book cover artist Robert Stanley. The book is made into a film in 1954, Yankee Pasha, starring Jeff Chandler and Rhonda Fleming, and featuring Mamie Van Doren. It was released by Universal Pictures."

  "text" : "Yama or Yamarāja, also called Imra, is a god of death, the south direction and the underworld, belonging to an early stratum of Rigvedic Hindu deities. In Sanskrit, his name can be interpreted to mean \"twin\". In the Zend-Avesta of Zoroastrianism, he is called \"Yima\". According to the Vishnu Purana, his parents are the sun-god Surya and Sanjna, the daughter of Vishvakarman. Yama is the brother of Sraddhadeva Manu and of his older sister Yami, which Horace Hayman Wilson indicates to mean the Yamuna. According to Harivamsa Purana her name is Daya. There is a temple in Srivanchiyam, Tamil Nadu dedicated to Yama. In the Vedas, Yama is said to have been the first mortal who died. By virtue of precedence, he became the ruler of the departed, and is called \"Lord of the Pitrs\". Mentioned in the Pāli Canon of Theravada Buddhism, Yama subsequently entered Buddhist mythology in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism as a dharmapala under various transliterations. He is otherwise also called as \"Dharmaraja\"."

  "text" : "Yo-Yo Boing! is a Spanglish novel by Puerto Rican poet and novelist Giannina Braschi. Braschi is the author of the postmodern poetry trilogy \"El imperio de los sueños/Empire of Dreams\" (1988) and the postcolonial dramatic novel United States of Banana (2011). Published in 1998 as the first full-length Spanglish novel, Yo-Yo Boing! is a linguistic hybrid of literary Spanish, American English, and Spanglish. The book mixes elements of poetry, fiction, essay, musical, manifesto, treatise, bastinado, memoir, and drama. The New York Daily News called it an \"in your-face-assertion of the vitality of Latino culture in the United States\". The book dramatizes the tensions between Anglo-American and Hispanic-American cultures in New York City."

Most of the pieces were first published in magazines, anthologies or other books by Carter; the remaining pieces are original to the present work. The book collects most of the extant tales about the youth of the author's sword and sorcery hero Thongor of Valkarth. Carter had planned to gather these and other Thongor tales he never lived to write into two projected collections, to be titled Thongor of Lost Lemuria and Thongor in the Land of Peril. Additional Thongor stories written after Carter's death by his literary executor Robert Price were combined with the existing tales to fill out the existing book, though it omits one Price Thongor story, \"Witch-Queen of Lemuria.\""

In this book, author Nick Cohen argues that unrestricted access to online information and social media may expedite the fall of dictators, but does not mean we live in an unprecedented era of freedom. He goes on to state that we are subject to ever-tightening structures on what we say, think or do. According to Cohen, privacy laws let the wealthy censor the press; protest against oppression is slammed as bigotry and voices of dissent can't be heard over \"the clamour hailing the internet as the saviour of democracy.\" While we seem more informed than ever before, states Cohen, his book aims to show that if we want to preserve free speech, we ignore history at our peril."

According to critics, is the most successful of Arguedas' novels, from a formal point of view. The author's effort is appreciated for offering the most authentic version possible of Andean life, without resorting to convention or the paternalism of previous indigenous literature."

The book has been challenged in some schools due to its title and language, and deals with the theme of teen bullying and its effects on the individual and their lives. Medina had initially titled the book Finding Yaqui del Gado, but changed the title upon the publisher's request. The book's premise is based on a similar situation Medina experienced in her youth and she expressed interest in readers using the book as a way to start discussing the topic of bullying."

The Yuan are the people of Lanna or Yonok, then an independent kingdom in the upper reaches of the Chao Phraya River basin with a capital at Chiang Mai. The poem was written to celebrate King Boromma Trailokanat of Ayutthaya (r. 1448-1488), the victor. The poem was probably written soon after the battle. It counts among only a handful of works of Thai literature from the Early Ayutthaya era that have survived, and may be still in its original form, without later revisions. The main body of the poem consists of 1,180 lines in a variant of the khlong (Thai: โคลง) meter. The poem is considered important as a source of historical information, as an example of poetic form and style, and as a repository of early Ayutthayan Thai language. A definitive edition was published by the Royal Institute of Thailand in 2001."

  "text" : "Young Bond is a series of young adult spy novels featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent James Bond as a young teenage boy attending school at Eton College in the 1930s. The series, written by Charlie Higson, was originally planned to include only five novels; however, after the release of the fifth novel, Higson considered the possibility of a second series. In October 2013 it was confirmed that a second series of four novels was in development, with the first novel due for release in Autumn 2014, but it would be penned by Steve Cole while Higson continued work on his young adult zombie series, The Enemy. Since the release of the first novel, SilverFin, in 2005, the series has become very successful and has led to further works including games, a graphic novel and even a supplemental travel guide. The last book, By Royal Command, was published in September 2008. English-language versions of the books are published by Puffin Books in the United Kingdom and Hyperion Books For Children in the United States."
