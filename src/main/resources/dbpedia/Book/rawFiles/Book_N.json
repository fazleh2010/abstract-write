  "text" : "For films named Northanger Abbey, see Northanger Abbey (1986 film) or Northanger Abbey (2007 film). Northanger Abbey /ˈnɔːrθˌæŋɡər/ was the first of Jane Austen's novels to be completed for publication, but published after her death, at the end of 1817. The novel is a satire of the Gothic novels popular at the time of its first writing in 1798–99. The heroine, Catherine, thinks life is like a Gothic novel, but her real experiences bring her down to earth as an ordinary young woman. Austen first titled it Susan, when she sold it in 1803 for £10 to a London bookseller, Crosby & Co., who decided against publishing. In the spring of 1816, the bookseller sold it back to the novelist's brother, Henry Austen, for the same sum, as the bookseller did not know that the writer was by then the author of four popular novels. Austen further revised the novel in 1816-1817, with the intention of having it published. The lead character's name was changed from Susan to Catherine, and Austen changed the working title to Catherine. Austen died in July 1817. Her brother Henry renamed the novel and arranged for publication of Northanger Abbey in late December 1817 (1818 given on the title page), as the first two volumes of a four-volume set; the other two volumes were the more recently completed Austen novel, Persuasion. Neither novel was published under the working title Jane Austen used. Aside from first being published together, the two novels are not linked, and later editions were published as separate novels. The novel is more explicitly comic than her other works and contains many literary allusions that her parents and siblings would have enjoyed, as a family entertainment—a piece of lighthearted parody to be read aloud by the fireside. The novel names many of the Gothic novels of that time and includes direct commentary by Austen on the value of novels, which were not valued as much as nonfiction or historical fiction. As most all her letters were burned after her death, later scholars appreciate this insight into Austen's views."

  "text" : "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution is a 1999 book co-authored by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins. It has been translated into a dozen languages and was the subject of a Harvard Business Review summary. In Natural Capitalism the authors describe the global economy as being dependent on natural resources and ecosystem services that nature provides. Natural Capitalism is a critique of traditional \"Industrial Capitalism\", saying that the traditional system of capitalism \"does not fully conform to its own accounting principles. It liquidates its capital and calls it income. It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs - the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.\" Natural capitalism recognizes the critical interdependency between the production and use of human-made capital and the maintenance and supply of natural capital. The authors argue that only through recognizing this essential relationship with the Earth's valuable resources can businesses, and the people they support, continue to exist. Their fundamental questions are: What would an economy look like if it fully valued all forms of capital? What if an economy were organized not around the abstractions of neoclassical economics and accountancy but around the biological realities of nature? What if generally accepted accounting principles recognized natural and human capital not as a free amenity in inexhaustible supply but as a finite and integrally valuable factor of production? What if in the absence of a rigorous way to practice such accounting, companies started to act as if such principles were in force. The Authors of Natural Capitalism say that these choices are possible and \"such an economy would offer a stunning new set of opportunities for all of society, amounting to no less than the next industrial revolution. The book has many practical suggestions for companies interested in a sustainable future. According to the authors, the \"next industrial revolution\" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: \"the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources\". While traditional industrial capitalism primarily recognizes the value of money and goods as capital, Natural Capitalism extends recognition to natural capital and human capital. Problems such as pollution and social injustice may then be seen as failures to properly account for capital, rather than as inherent failures of capitalism itself. The fundamental assumptions of Natural Capitalism are as follows: 1.  \n* The limiting factor to future economic development is the availability and functionality of natural capital, in particular, life-supporting services that have no substitutes and currently have no market value. 2.  \n* Misconceived or badly designed business systems, population growth, and wasteful patterns of consumption are the primary causes of the loss of natural capital, and all three must be addressed to achieve a sustainable economy. 3.  \n* Future economic progress can best take place in democratic, market-based systems of production and distribution in which all forms of capital are fully valued, including human, manufactured, financial, and natural capital. 4.  \n* One of the keys to the most beneficial employment of people, money, and the environment is radical increases in resource productivity. 5.  \n* Human welfare is best served by improving the quality and flow of desired services delivered, rather than by merely increasing the total dollar flow. 6.  \n* Economic and environmental sustainability depends on redressing global inequities of income and material well-being."

The novel tells the story of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas, an African-American youth living in utter poverty in a poor area on Chicago's South Side in the 1930s. While not apologizing for Bigger's crimes, Wright portrays a systemic inevitability behind them. Bigger's lawyer makes the case that there is no escape from this destiny for his client or any other black American since they are the necessary product of the society that formed them and told them since birth who exactly they were supposed to be. \"No American Negro exists\", James Baldwin once wrote, \"who does not have his private Bigger Thomas living in his skull.\" Frantz Fanon discusses the feeling in his 1952 essay, L'expérience vécue du noir, or The Fact of Blackness. \"In the end\", writes Fanon, \"Bigger Thomas acts. To put an end to his tension, he acts, he responds to the world's anticipation.\""

  "text" : "The Natural History (Latin: Naturalis Historia) is an early encyclopedia in Latin by Pliny the Elder, who died in 79 AD. It is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover all ancient knowledge. The work's subject area is thus not limited to what is today understood by natural history; Pliny himself defines his scope as \"the natural world, or life\". The work is divided into 37 books, organised into ten volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones. The Natural History became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus's reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived and the last that he published. He began it in 77, and had not made a final revision at the time of his death during the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius."

  "text" : "Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is a 1989 book by United States academic Noam Chomsky concerning political power using propaganda to distort and distract from major issues to maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming effective. The title of this book borrows a phrase from the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr. Nearly the entire first half of the book is based on Chomsky's five 1988 Massey Lectures on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio from November 1988 and extends his and Edward S. Herman's propaganda model to a variety of new situations. The remaining appendices address criticisms of the work and provide additional detail. As a genre of political thought, parallels exist between Niebuhr's \"necessary illusions\" and the \"noble lies\" of Leo Strauss, \"public relations\" of Edward Bernays and \"myth making\" of Niccolò Machiavelli. Likewise, Chomsky's analyses in Necessary Illusions represent a refocus on the use of these patterns of power, which he implies to underscore the failure of populations - particularly in a representative democracy - to learn from history in this regard."

  "text" : "Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers: How Agriculture Really Began is a book by the British science writer Colin Tudge. The book is one of a series of long essays by respected contemporary Darwinian thinkers, which were published under the collective title Darwinism Today; the series was inspired by a course of 'Darwin Seminars' which took place at the LSE in London in the late 1990s. In Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers, Colin Tudge offers an explanation for the beginning of the population explosion. Tudge explains that farming was not suddenly invented 10,000 years ago, but had existed as what he called proto-farming or hobby farming for at least 30,000 years earlier. What happened 10,000 years ago in the fertile crescent was the raising of sea level at the end of the ice age over a relatively short period of time. This forced a population who were primarily hunter-gatherers to leave a rich prey region and to move inland. The new area was less able to support these immigrants as hunter-gatherers, and they were forced to increase their labors to extend their use of farming in order to maintain their population. The following quote gives Tudge's explanation for what happened next. \"Hunter gatherers take from their environment only what their environment happens to produce; and if they take too much, the desirable prey species collapse. [...] But the whole point of agriculture is to manipulate the environment so as to increase the amount of food that it will provide. [...] And if you increase the food supply, you can increase your own population. But then, of course, the farmers find themselves in a vicious spiral. The more they farm, the more their population rises and the more they are obliged to farm, because only by farming can they feed the extra mouths.\""

  "text" : "In the English language, the word \"nigger\" is an ethnic slur, usually directed at black people. The word originated as a neutral term referring to people with black skin, as a variation of the Spanish and Portuguese noun negro, a descendant of the Latin adjective niger (\"black\"). It was often used derogatorily, and by the mid-twentieth century, particularly in the United States, its usage became unambiguously pejorative, a racist insult. Accordingly, it began to disappear from popular culture, and its continued inclusion in classic works of literature has sparked controversy. In contemporary English, using the word \"nigger\" is considered extremely offensive, and it is often replaced with the euphemism \"the N-word\". The variant \"nigga\" has to some extent been reclaimed by African Americans."

In the story, Carl Corey wakes up in a secluded New York hospital with amnesia. He escapes and investigates, discovering the truth, piece by piece: he is really Prince Corwin, of Amber, the one true world of which our Earth is just a shadow. He is one of nine men who might rule Amber, if he can fight his way past the armies of his older brother Eric."

The vignettes (which Burroughs called \"routines\") are drawn from Burroughs' own experience in these places, and his addiction to drugs (heroin, morphine, and while in Tangier, majoun (a strong marijuana confection) as well as a German opioid, brand name Eukodol, of which he wrote frequently). The novel was included in Time magazine's \"100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\". In 1991, David Cronenberg released a film of the same name based upon the novel and other Burroughs writings."

  "text" : "Nova Express is a 1964 novel by American author William S. Burroughs. It was written using the 'fold-in' method, a version of the cut-up method, developed by Burroughs with Brion Gysin, of enfolding snippets of different texts into the novel. It is part of The Nova Trilogy, or \"Cut-Up Trilogy,' together with The Soft Machine and The Ticket That Exploded. Burroughs considered the trilogy a \"sequel\" or \"mathematical\" continuation of Naked Lunch. Nova Express was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965. It is listed in David Pringle's 1985 book Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels. Grove Press printed a 'Restored' edition in 2014, edited by Oliver Harris, which made a number of corrections and added an introduction and extensive notes. The introduction argued for the care with which Burroughs used his methods and established the text's complex manuscript histories."

  "text" : "Night (1960) is a work by Elie Wiesel about his experience with his father in the Nazi German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944–1945, at the height of the Holocaust toward the end of the Second World War. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. \"If only I could get rid of this dead weight ... Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.\" In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed. \"Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends,\" a kapo tells him. \"Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.\" Wiesel was 16 when Buchenwald was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945, too late for his father, who died after a beating while Wiesel lay silently on the bunk above for fear of being beaten too. He moved to Paris after the war and in 1954 completed an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish about his experiences, published in Argentina as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign (\"And the World Remained Silent\"). The novelist François Mauriac helped him find a French publisher. Les Éditions de Minuit published 178 pages as La Nuit in 1958, and in 1960 Hill & Wang in New York published a 116-page translation as Night. Fifty years later the book had been translated into 30 languages, and now ranks as one of the bedrocks of Holocaust literature. It remains unclear how much of Night is memoir. Wiesel has called it his deposition, but scholars have had difficulty approaching it as an unvarnished account. The literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that the pruning of the text from Yiddish to French transformed an angry historical account into a work of art. Night is the first in a trilogy—Night, Dawn, Day—marking Wiesel's transition during and after the Holocaust from darkness to light, according to the Jewish tradition of beginning a new day at nightfall. \"In Night,\" he said, \"I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end—man, history, literature, religion, God. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with night.\""

Answer N. or M.\" The \"N. or M.\" here stands for the Latin, \"nomen vel nomina\", meaning \"name or names\". It is an accident of typography that \"nomina\" came to be represented by \"m\". The novel is the first to feature the mature versions of her detectives Tommy and Tuppence, whose previous appearances had been in the adventure The Secret Adversary (1922) and the short story collection Partners in Crime (1929)."

It was initially published in Britain in 1992, and was on the New York Times Best Seller list for 15 weeks in the first half of 1993. Nobody Nowhere covers Williams' life from as far back as she can remember (three years old). At times she was thought to be deaf, psychotic, disturbed or retarded, but only as an adult did she discover that her difficulty interfacing with the world around her was related to autism. It ends with her leaving the manuscript behind with a UK child psychiatrist, Sebastian Kraemer, who sent it on to autism specialist Frances Tustin, who was responsible for its eventual publication. Donna Williams is also the author of the screenplay of the same name which is optioned to Hollywood film producer, Beverly Nero. Williams released a music album by the same name in 2000. Somebody Somewhere (1994) was the sequel. This installment picks up the story of her becoming a teacher and the first book becoming published, and how that changed her life. Later autobiographical works include Like Colour To The Blind (1998) and Everyday Heaven (2004) which are among her nine published books."

Northern Lights is the first book of a trilogy, His Dark Materials (1995 to 2000). Alfred A. Knopf published the first US edition April 1996, entitled The Golden Compass. Under that title it has been adapted as a 2007 feature film by Hollywood and as a companion video game. Pullman won the 1995 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's outstanding British children's book. For the 70th anniversary of the Medal, it was named one of the top ten winning works by a panel, composing the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Northern Lights won the public vote from that shortlist and was thus named the all-time \"Carnegie of Carnegies\" on 21 June 2007."

  "text" : "Night Over Water is a politically minded novel written by author Ken Follett and published by William Morrow in 1991. It was reprinted as a paperback book in the United States in 1992. Night Over Water is a fictionalized account of the final flight of the Pan American Clipper passenger airplane during the first few days of World War II, early September, 1939. Follett is careful to state that, though the flight and all of the characters are fictional the plane, a Boeing 314, was real and was nicknamed the \"Pan Am Clipper.\" It was a seaplane, an aircraft that landed in the sea, not on an airstrip, powered by 4 propeller engines. It was capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in little more than 24 hours with intermediate stops in Shannon Estuary at Foynes, Ireland, Bay of Exploits at Botwood, Newfoundland and Shediac Bay, Canada, at each of which stop Follett adds a scene or two of intrigue. This route made the Pan Am Clipper the fastest mode of transatlantic travel at the time — and very appealing to those who wanted to escape from Britain before the start of the war. The tale begins with several separated threads, telling the individual stories of the people who later all end up in this last flight to New York. Though Follett manages to bundle all these together, the events the characters share while travelling with the clipper are still told through the perspectives introduced before. Each of these main characters is heading for his own interests in the beginning but soon they melt together. The theme is the importance of recognizing the threat of totalitarianism and also a feminist message of women standing up for themselves."

Notes is considered by many to be one of the first existentialist novels. It presents itself as an excerpt from the rambling memoirs of a bitter, isolated, unnamed narrator (generally referred to by critics as the Underground Man) who is a retired civil servant living in St. Petersburg. The first part of the story is told in monologue form, or the underground man's diary, and attacks emerging Western philosophy, especially Nikolay Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?. The second part of the book is called \"Apropos of the Wet Snow\", and describes certain events that, it seems, are destroying and sometimes renewing the underground man, who acts as a first person, unreliable narrator and anti-hero."

  "text" : "Naked, published in 1997, is a collection of essays by American humorist David Sedaris. The book details Sedaris’ life, from his unusual upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, to his booze-and-drug-ridden college years, to his Kerouacian wandering as a young adult. The book became a best-seller and was acclaimed for its wit, dark humor and irreverent tackling of tragic events, including the death of Sedaris’ mother. Prior to publication, several of the essays were read by the author on the Public Radio International program This American Life. Naked won the Randy Shilts Award for Gay Non-Fiction from Publishing Triangle in 1998."

  "text" : "Night Watch (Russian: Ночной дозор) is the fantasy novel by the Russian author Sergei Lukyanenko to feature his fictional world of the Others. Lukyanenko wrote the story in 1998 and the book was first published in Russia by AST in 1998. The story revolves around a confrontation between two opposing supernatural groups (known as \"Others\"): the Night Watch, an organization dedicated to policing the actions of the Dark Others—and the Day Watch, which polices the actions of the Light Others. The novel is first in a cycle that continues with Day Watch (Dnevnoy Dozor, Дневной дозор), Twilight Watch (Sumerechny Dozor, Сумеречный дозор), Final Watch (Posledniy Dozor, Последний дозор), New Watch (Novyi dozor, Новый дозор), and Sixth Watch (Shestoi Dozor, Шестой Дозор). The first story of the novel, Destiny, was made into a successful Russian film, Night Watch, which, although keeping the characters and many of the events of the original novel, alters some significant elements of the story."

  "text" : "Nigger Heaven is a 1926 novel written by Carl Van Vechten, set during the Harlem Renaissance in the United States in the 1920s. The book and its title have been controversial since its publication. The novel is a portrayal of life in the \"great black walled city\" of Harlem. It describes the interactions of intellectuals, political activists, bacchanalian workers, and other Harlem characters. The plot of the novel concerns two people, a quiet librarian and an aspiring writer, who try to keep their love alive as racism denies them every opportunity. This roman à clef became an instant bestseller and served as an informal pocket guide to Harlem. It also split the black literary community, as some, e.g. Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen, appreciated it, while others like Countee Cullen and W. E. B. Du Bois, regarded it as an \"affront to the hospitality of black folks\". The book fuelled a period of \"Harlemania\", during which the area of Harlem became en vogue among white people, who then frequented its cabarets, bars, and so on. It is also believed to be the source of the phrase, \"stop on a dime.\""

Dune is set on the dangerous, sandworm-ridden desert planet Arrakis, sole source of the spice melange, the most valuable substance in the universe. The parody follows a similar storyline, wherein rival restaurant-owning families battle for control of Arruckus, which is overrun by giant pretzels and the source of valuable beer."

  "text" : "News from Nowhere (1890) is a classic work combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer William Morris. It was first published in serial form in the Commonweal journal beginning on 11 January 1890. In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work. The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris fuses Marxism and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship—and through them for a reborn self—he encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman. The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolishment of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work. In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common criticisms of socialism; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communistic society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. News From Nowhere was written as a Libertarian socialist response to an earlier book called Looking Backward, a book that epitomises a kind of state socialism that Morris abhorred. It was also meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time regarding the tactics to bring about socialism."

  "text" : "Norwegian Wood (ノルウェイの森 Noruwei no Mori) is a 1987 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami.The novel is a nostalgic story of loss and burgeoning sexuality. It is told from the first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student living in Tokyo. Through Watanabe's reminiscences we see him develop relationships with two very different women — the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori. The novel is set in Tokyo during the late 1960s, at a time when Japanese students, like those of many other nations, were protesting against the established order. While it serves as the backdrop against which the events of the novel unfold, Murakami (through the eyes of Watanabe and Midori) portrays the student movement as largely weak-willed and hypocritical. Murakami adapted the first section of the novel from an earlier short story, \"Firefly\". The story was subsequently included in the collection Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman. Norwegian Wood was hugely popular with Japanese youth and made Murakami something of a superstar in his native country (apparently much to his dismay at the time). A film adaptation of the same name was released in 2010, directed by Tran Anh Hung."

  "text" : "Nausea (French: La Nausée) is a philosophical novel by the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, published in 1938. It is Sartre's first novel and, in his opinion, one of his best works. The novel takes place in 'Bouville' (literally, 'Mud town') a town similar to Le Havre, and it concerns a dejected historian, who becomes convinced that inanimate objects and situations encroach on his ability to define himself, on his intellectual and spiritual freedom, evoking in the protagonist a sense of nausea. French writer Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre's lifelong partner, claims that La Nausée grants consciousness a remarkable independence and gives reality the full weight of its sense. It is one of the canonical works of existentialism. Sartre was awarded, though he ultimately declined, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964. The Nobel Foundation recognized him \"for his work which, rich in ideas and filled with the spirit of freedom and the quest for truth, has exerted a far-reaching influence on our age.\" Sartre was one of the few people to have declined the award, referring to it as merely a function of a bourgeois institution. The novel has been translated into English at least twice, by Lloyd Alexander as \"The Diary of Antoine Roquentin\" (John Lehmann, 1949) and by Robert Baldick as \"Nausea\" (Penguin Books, 1965)."

  "text" : "Nоva (1968) is a science fiction novel by Samuel R. Delany. Nominally space opera, it explores the politics and culture of a future where cyborg technology is universal (the novel is one of the precursors to cyberpunk), yet major decisions can involve using tarot cards. It has strong mythological overtones, relating to both the Grail Quest and Jason's Argonautica for the golden fleece. Nova was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1969. David Pringle lists it as one of the 100 best science-fiction novels written since World War II. After completing Nova at the age of 25, Delany's published output stopped for several years—though his writing continued. Delany completed the first draft of Tides of Lust (author's title, Equinox) in September 1968 (it appeared in 1973). He first completed Hogg in June 1969 (though the novel itself would not appear until 1995). With the publication of his next major novel, Dhalgren (1975), however, his style had moved on in experimental directions notably different from that of his earlier work."

It is one of the best-documented early printed books—an incunabulum—and one of the first to successfully integrate illustrations and text. Latin scholars refer to it as Liber Chronicarum (Book of Chronicles) as this phrase appears in the index introduction of the Latin edition. English-speakers have long referred to it as the Nuremberg Chronicle after the city in which it was published. German-speakers refer to it as Die Schedelsche Weltchronik (Schedel's World History) in honour of its author."

Writing of the novel began in 1924, and from March to June, Osaka's Morning News (大阪朝日新聞 Osaka Asahi Shinbun) published the first several chapters of the serial. Four months later, the periodical Female (女性 Josei) started to publish the remaining chapters. Various Japanese and United States publishers have compiled the chapters and published them as a book since 1947. Narrated in the first person by the protagonist, a salaryman named Jōji, the novel follows his attempt to groom a Eurasian-looking girl, the titular Naomi, to be a Westernized woman. Naomi is a significant work in its comic depiction of Japanese culture of the era and its fascination with the West. The clash between older and newer generations over the more progressive depictions of women, such as Naomi, has been viewed as a clash over Japan's transition into the modern period."

Gresham attributed the origin of Nightmare Alley to conversations he had with a former carnival worker while they were both serving as volunteers with the Loyalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. Gresham wrote the novel, his first, while working as an editor for a \"true crime,\" pulp magazine in New York City during the 1940s. He outlined the plot and wrote the first six chapters over a period of two years, then finished the book in four months. Each chapter is represented by a different Tarot card."

It was first published in 1932 and was penned by Walter Karig, a replacement writer for Mildred Wirt Benson. Benson declined series work when the Depression forced a reduction in the contract fee provided to Stratemeyer Syndicate writers, so Karig, already an established Stratemeyer writer, took over the authorship. Due to Karig having died in 1956, the 1932 version passed into the public domain in Canada and other countries that have a life plus 50 policy, in 2007."

In this work, Bacon portrayed a vision of the future of human discovery and knowledge, expressing his aspirations and ideals for humankind. The novel depicts the creation of a utopian land where \"generosity and enlightenment, dignity and splendour, piety and public spirit\" are the commonly held qualities of the inhabitants of the mythical Bensalem.

  "text" : "Number the Stars (1989) is a work of historical fiction by American author Lois Lowry, about the escape of a Jewish family (the Rosens) from Copenhagen during World War II. The story centers on ten-year-old Annemarie Johansen, who lives with her family in Copenhagen in 1943. She becomes a part of the events related to the rescue of the Danish Jews, when thousands of Jews were helped to reach neutral ground in Sweden in order to avoid being relocated to concentration camps. She risked her life in order to help her best friend, Ellen Rosen, by pretending that Ellen is Annemarie's late older sister Lise, who had died earlier in the war. Lise had been killed by the Nazi military as a result of her work with the Danish Resistance. The story's title is taken from a reference to Psalm 147:4, in which the writer relates that God has numbered all the stars and has named each one of them. It ties into the Star of David, worn by Ellen on her necklace, which is symbolic to Judaism. The novel was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1990 as the previous year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". Lois Lowry traveled to Copenhagen to conduct research and interviews for the book. She took the photo of the girl used for the cover (shown in infobox here). That cover was used on many editions of the book."

The book is narrated in the same fashion as Black's stand-up routines, with explicit language, sarcasm, and constant fits of rage. The book primarily accounts Lewis' admiration for his seemingly eccentric family, his disregard for authority, his education, past habitual drug use, his perspectives on current issues, and other real-life events such as his hitchhiking trip in Europe or his late pet dog, John-John. The book's layout is in semi-chronological order. The book has no table of contents and a lengthy page of acknowledgments."

  "text" : "Nowhere Man is a novel by Aleksandar Hemon, published in 2002 and named after the Beatles song \"Nowhere Man\". The novel (subtitled The Pronek Fantasies) centers around the character of Jozef Pronek, a Bosnian refugee, who was already the subject of Hemon's novella Blind Jozef Pronek & Dead Souls published in his short story collection The Question of Bruno (2000). The novel incorporated autobiographical elements and is composed as a series of vignettes telling the story of a character named Jozef Pronek, a Ukrainian born and raised in Bosnia. Pronek's biography is related by multiple narrators, and the book can be divided into three sections. The first section describes Pronek's peaceful childhood in 1980s Sarajevo. The second section follows Pronek as he is a university student in Kiev in the Soviet Union at the time of the 1991 political turmoil (narrated by his dormitory roommate Victor Plavchuk). In the third part of the book Pronek is an immigrant in Chicago, where he works in a series of low-paid jobs including working as a Greenpeace canvasser, which enables him to observe the lives of middle-class Chicagoans. The novel's final chapter, spanning the years 1900 to 2000, is a departure from Pronek's adventures and recounts the story of a Russian White Army officer and his adventures in Harbin and Shanghai."

  "text" : "New Poems (German: Neue Gedichte) is a two-part collection of poems written by Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926). The first volume, dedicated to Elisabeth and Karl von der Heydt was composed from 1902 to 1907 and was published in the same year by Insel Verlag in Leipzig. The second volume (New Poems: The Other Part), dedicated to Auguste Rodin, was completed in 1908 and published by the same publisher. With the exception of eight poems written in Capri, Rilke composed most of them in Paris and Meudon. At the start of each volume he placed, respectively, Früher Apollo (Early Apollo) and Archaïscher Torso Apollos (Archaic Torso of Apollo), poems about sculptures of the poet-God. These poems, many of them sonnets, are often intensely focused on the visual. They show Rilke aware of the objective world and of the people amongst whom he lives. The poems are astonishingly concentrated: both short, and compacting a profundity of experience into small compass. He called them Dinggedichte, which translated literally means \"Thing-Poems,\" intending to reveal both that the poems were about \"things\" and that the poems had become, so concentrated and whole in themselves were they, things (poetic objects) themselves. Along with The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, the collection is considered to be the main work of his middle period, which clearly stands out from the work preceding and following it. It marks a shift from the emotive poetry of ecstatic subjectivity and interiority, which somewhat dominates his three-part The Book of Hours, to the objective language of the Dinggedicte. With this new poetic orientation, which was influenced by the visual arts and especially Rodin, Rilke came to be considered one of the most important poets of literary modernism."

  "text" : "North and South is a social novel by English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. Along with Wives and Daughters (1865) and Cranford (1853), it is one of her best known novels and has been adapted for television twice, in 1975 and 2004. The latter version renewed interest in the novel and gained it a wider readership. While Gaskell's first novel Mary Barton (1848) focused on relations between employers and workers in Manchester from the perspective of the working poor, North and South uses a protagonist from southern England to present and comment on the perspectives of both mill owners and mill workers in an industrializing city. North and South is set in the fictional industrial town of Milton in the North of England. Forced to leave her home in the tranquil rural south, Margaret Hale settles with her parents in Milton where she witnesses the brutal world wrought by the industrial revolution and employers and workers clashing in the first organised strikes. Sympathetic to the poor, whose courage and tenacity she admires and among whom she makes friends, she clashes with John Thornton, a cotton mill manufacturer who belongs to the nouveaux riches class and whose contemptuous attitude to workers Margaret rejects. The novel traces both her growing understanding of the complexity of labor relations and her impact on well-meaning mill owners, and her conflicted relationship with John Thornton. Gaskell based her depiction of Milton on Manchester, where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister."

Solar noon is when the sun crosses the meridian and is at its highest elevation in the sky, at 12 o'clock apparent solar time. The local or clock time of solar noon depends on the longitude and date. The opposite of noon is midnight. In many cultures in the Northern Hemisphere, noon had ancient geographic associations with the direction \"south\" (as did midnight with \"north\" in some cultures). Remnants of the noon = south association are preserved in the words for noon in French (Midi) and Italian (Mezzogiorno), both of which also refer to the southern parts of the respective countries. Modern Polish, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Serbian go a step farther, with the words for noon (południe, поўдзень, південь, пoднe – literally \"half-day\") also meaning \"south\" and the words for \"midnight\" (północ, поўнач, північ, пoнoħ – literally \"half-night\", as with English mid(dle) meaning \"half\") also meaning \"north\"."

  "text" : "Never Surrender is a novel by Michael Dobbs, based on historical events of the first few weeks of May 1940. It is a sequel to Dobbs' novel, Winston's War, which is based on the events surrounding the demise of Neville Chamberlain and the appointment of Winston Churchill as Prime Minister. “Churchill… is the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street”. So concludes Roy Jenkins in his definitive biography of the great wartime leader. Michael Dobbs, the author of this novel, states in an after note, “the world will never know the full debt of gratitude it owes to Winston Spencer Churchill”. Never Surrender begins with Europe in turmoil. The date is May 10, 1940. Germany has just completed its conquest of Denmark and Norway and has turned its attack to the west by invading France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The government of the United Kingdom is in chaos. Neville Chamberlain has stepped down or been forced from the Prime Minister's office. And the man nobody really wants, the highly unpopular Winston Churchill, has been chosen to succeed him. Within days of his taking office, the Low Countries have been overrun and the mighty French army is crumbling to crushing defeat in the face of Germany’s blitzkrieg. The governments of France and Belgium are about to capitulate. The British Expeditionary Force, transported to the continent during the months of “Phoney War”, have been cut off from their French allies and are scattered and stranded along the Channel coastline. Pummelled by the German Luftwaffe air superiority and pounded by the Wehrmacht’s Panzers, it faces total annihilation. This novel tells the story; of the political intrigue, of the internal cabinet dissension, and the indomitable will of the man who rallies a nation, turns the tide of defeatism, and convinces the entire population to “never surrender”."

  "text" : "Northwest Passage is an historical novel by Kenneth Roberts, published in 1937. Told through the eyes of primary character Langdon Towne, much of the novel follows the exploits and character of Robert Rogers, the leader of Rogers' Rangers, who were a colonial force fighting with the British during the French and Indian War. Structurally, Northwest Passage is divided into halves. The first half is a carefully researched, day-by-day recreation of the raid by Rogers' Rangers on the Indian village at Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec (or Saint Francis, to the Americans troops), a settlement of the Abenakis, an American Indian tribe. The second half of the novel covers Rogers' later life in London, England, and Fort Michilimackinac, Michigan. Roberts' decision to cover the novel's material in two distinct halves followed the actual trajectory of Rogers' life. The book later served as the basis for a 1940 movie starring Spencer Tracy and a 1958-59 TV show on NBC starring Buddy Ebsen."

  "text" : "Notable Last Facts is a book published by the American librarian/writer William B. Brahms in 2004 and was the first relatively comprehensive collection of important lasts. Although that work mainly details American culture (TV, Radio, Sports are almost completely American examples), and to a lesser extent with European culture (in Art, Music and Transportation for example), some sections (Nations, Wars, Slavery, Voting, and Era & Empires for example) do have a broad international treatment. The smaller trivia books on \"lasts\" by Christopher Slee (cited below) have a treatment that is almost exclusively limited to the United Kingdom. Examples of \"Notable Last Facts\" include the last surviving participant or witness to a historic event, the last work produced by a major artist, author, performer or musician, or perhaps the last remaining example of a once-prevalent style or object, such as a type of architecture, or a make or model of an automobile, motorcycle, or airplane. Notable lasts are often used a finite demarcations of social, artistic and historical eras or periods. They also serve, often unintentionally, to mark advances, failures and change. In other fields of study, a notable last can be used to assist in dating objects, buildings and artifacts by helping to establish a terminus ante quem or a terminus post quem relative to the date of the notable last event. A differentiation is made between a simple \"last\" (which includes the last time something happened that will likely happen again—such as the last time there was an unassisted triple play in baseball or the last time it snowed in September in New York City) and a \"notable last\" (which are limited to concrete endings; thus not possible or highly improbable to ever happen again—such as a deceased composer's last work or the last act in a specific war that has ended)."

  "text" : "Nightmare in Wichita: The Hunt for the BTK Strangler by lawyer Robert Beattie is a non-fiction book about a serial killer in Wichita, Kansas known as the BTK Strangler. The book debuted at No. 4 on The New York Times bestseller list upon its April 2005 release. Dennis Rader, a city compliance officer and church council president working in Park City, just north of Wichita, was ultimately arrested, charged and convicted of the crimes. Beattie, who lives in Wichita, compiled the book based on interviews with police officers and detectives familiar with the case. Rader's capture, on February 25, 2005, happened just as the book was in the final stages of editing. An addendum about Rader and his arrest was added before the book went to press. Many, including some Wichita police officers, have speculated that the fact that a book about BTK was being written was what caused the killer to reemerge in 2004, which led to his arrest the following year. Beattie researched the book for two years. In its review, truTV's \"Crime Library\" criticized the book for filling up \"many, many pages with (the author's) meetings with various individuals that clearly interested Beattie, but are likely to bore readers.\" But the article also credited the book for including \"quite a bit of detail that never got into the newspapers.\""

In addition to the democratic peace, Weart argues that there is also an oligarchic peace and provides a new explanation for both the democratic and oligarchic peace. The book is often mentioned in the academic debate and has received both praise and criticism."

  "text" : "Nervous Conditions is a novel by Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga, first published in the United Kingdom in 1988 by the Women's Press. The semi-autobiographical novel focuses on the story of a Rhodesian family in post-colonial Rhodesia during the 1960s. Nervous Conditions is the first of a proposed trilogy, with The Book of Not published in 2006 as the second novel in the series. The novel attempts to illustrate the dynamic themes of race, colonialism, and gender during the post-colonial conditions of present-day Zimbabwe. The title is taken from the introduction by Jean-Paul Sartre to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth."

  "text" : "Nor Crystal Tears (1982) is a first-contact novel written by Alan Dean Foster about the meeting of the insectoid Thranx and Man. This sets in motion the creation of the Humanx Commonwealth; the political body that is the union of human and thranx society which forms the foundation for many of Foster's science-fiction novels. Nor Crystal Tears is written from the perspective of the Thranx and the cultural lens through which they encounter the monstrous, fleshy alien mammals known as humans. A primary theme is the paranoia and fear the two vastly different races naturally have for each other upon first contact, but also how individuals are able to overcome these innate fears and prejudices and set in motion the foundation for what would become Foster's Humanx Commonwealth. Foster would further expand on this theme, using another (unrelated) alien race, the furry Quozl in their eponymous novel. Nor Crystal Tears was published August 12, 1982 and is Foster's ninth book set in the Humanx Commonwealth. Given that Foster's first novel, The Tar-Aiym Krang was also his first novel set in the Humanx Commonwealth, Nor Crystal Tears both celebrates the tenth anniversary of his Humanx Commonwealth and his career as an author."

For example, from 1904 to 1909 Wodehouse edited the \"By the Way\" column for the now-defunct The Globe newspaper, while the book's main character, James Orlebar Cloyster, writes the \"On Your Way\" column for the Orb newspaper.

  "text" : "Nights at the Circus is a novel by Angela Carter, first published in 1984 and that year's winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. The novel focuses on the life and exploits of Sophie Fevvers, a woman who is – or so she would have people believe – a Cockney virgin, hatched from an egg laid by unknown parents and ready to develop fully fledged wings. At the time of the story, she has become a celebrated aerialiste, and she captivates the young journalist Jack Walser, who runs away with the circus and falls into a world that his journalistic exploits had not prepared him to encounter. Nights at the Circus incorporates multiple categories of fiction, including postmodernism, magical realism, and postfeminism. As in her previous works, Carter plays with many literary aspects and dissects the traditional fairy tale structure. In 2006, the novel was adapted for the stage by Tom Morris and Emma Rice for Kneehigh Theatre Company. It was performed at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, Bristol Old Vic, Bristol and then toured."

  "text" : "Nadja (1928), the second novel published by André Breton, is one of the iconic works of the French surrealist movement. It begins with the question, \"Who am I?\" It is based on Breton's actual interactions with a young woman, Nadja (actually Léona Camile Ghislaine Delacourt 1902–1941), over the course of ten days, and is presumed to be a semi-autobiographical description of his relationship with a mad patient of Pierre Janet. The book's non-linear structure is grounded in reality by references to other Paris surrealists such as Louis Aragon and 44 photographs. The last sentence of the book (\"Beauty will be CONVULSIVE or will not be at all\") provided the title for Pierre Boulez's flute concerto ...explosante-fixe.... Dating from 1960, the widely available English translation by Richard Howard is a translation of the first edition of Breton's novel, dating from 1928. Breton published a second, revised edition in 1964. No English translation of this second edition is currently available."

A classically trained baritone, he is best remembered for the eight films in which he costarred with soprano Jeanette MacDonald. He was one of the first \"crossover\" stars, a superstar appealing both to shrieking bobby soxers as well as opera purists, and in his heyday, he was the highest paid singer in the world. During his 40-year career, he earned three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (one each for film, recording, and radio), left his footprints in the wet cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater, earned three Gold records, and was invited to sing at the third inauguration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941. He also introduced millions of young Americans to classical music and inspired many of them to pursue a musical career."

  "text" : "The National Occupational Classification, or NOC, is a systematic taxonomy in English of all occupations in the Canadian labour market. As a Canadian government publication it is concurrently published in French as Classification nationale des professions. Organized into two volumes, it describes 923 distinct occupations in terms of aptitudes, interests, education, physical activities, and other qualifiers. A separate index further classifies over 25,000 job titles from the listed occupations. The NOC is used by program planners, labour economists, rehabilitation professionals, and others in the health and social services fields in Canada, as well as by insurance companies and litigators. It is published by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), which is the Department of the Government of Canada which supports public policies for labour market, social development, early childhood and post secondary education. The first Edition of the NOC was published in 1992, and a Second Revised Edition was offered in 2001. A minor revision was made in 2006. It is available in printed form, on CD-ROM, and on-line. A 2011 version is in development and is expected to be published in 2016. The NOC supersedes the Canadian Classification Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO), which was published by HRSDC in 1981. A variation of the NOC, known as NOC-S or National Occupational Classification for Statistics, is maintained by Statistics Canada. According to the NOC-S website, \"The two classifications [NOC & NOC-S] differ only in the aggregation structure of the classification.\" The first use of the NOC-S 2001 was in the 2001 Census of Population. The NOC is one of the main data sources that supports the Working in Canada Tool which is part of the Government of Canada's Going to Canada - Immigration Portal."

The report, set up by a Congress Party government, recommended the \"legal prohibition\" of religious conversion not \"completely voluntary\", which was not implemented as it would have been \"difficult to formulate and indeed to apply without violating the precepts of religious liberty enshrined in the Indian Constitution\"."

  "text" : "Necessary Roughness (1996) is a drama novel by Asian-American author Marie G. Lee. It features a discussion about discrimination and a clash of cultures between Korean parents and their children's American ways. Set around the fictional town of Iron River, Minnesota, it is the story of a young boy's transplantation from the city of Los Angeles to a rural town in Minnesota and his use of football to escape the bigotry that he faces and the conflict he experiences with his parents. The Kim family is forced to move from their hometown of L.A. to Iron City, Minnesota. Abogee's (Chan's father) brother, Bong, left abruptly without paying any of his debts. The Kims had to pay his bills, and run the store he left behind. Chan had a twin sister, Young. Back in L.A., Chan was on a soccer team, and Young was in an orchestra. When they moved to Minnesota, however, Chan joined the football team, and a family tragedy decides his career."

  "text" : "No Longer Human (人間失格 Ningen Shikkaku) is a Japanese novel by Osamu Dazai. Published after Run Melos and The Setting Sun, No Longer Human is considered Dazai's masterpiece and ranks as the second-best selling novel in Japan, behind Natsume Sōseki's Kokoro. The literal translation of the title, discussed by Donald Keene in his preface to the English translation, is \"Disqualified from Being Human\". (The Italian translation was titled Lo squalificato, The Disqualified.) This novel, despite being serialized as a work of fiction in 1948, is narrated in the first person and contains several elements which betray an autobiographical basis, such as suicide—a recurring theme in the author's life. Many also believe the book to have been his will, as he took his own life shortly after the last part of the book was published, on June 13, 1948. One modern analyst has proposed Dazai was suffering from complex post-traumatic stress disorder when he wrote the book."

  "text" : "Nicholas and the Higs was one of several early, unpublished novels by noted science fiction author Philip K. Dick. It was written somewhere around 1957 during the waning days of his second marriage, was re-written at the behest of his publisher in 1958, and was then ultimately rejected for publication. The original manuscripts have been lost, and no copies are known to be extant. Among Dick's numerous lost novels, this one was unique because it represented his earliest full-length literary attempt to blend mainstream literary fiction with science fiction. Up until this time, Dick had written numerous \"straight\" (non-SF) novels, all rejected for publication, and had published several science fiction novels and numerous short stories, but he regarded his science fiction as \"merely something to pay the bills,\" and kept his genre career separate from his \"grown-up\" literary aspiration. In this novel, he allegedly attempted to blend the two for the first time."

The first edition, published by Elm Tree Books in 1982, did not sell well, but over the years it attained a near-cult status and a paperback edition was released in 1991. Rigg wrote to her many friends and acquaintances in the theatre and film industries and asked them to share their worst-ever reviews. She also researched theatre criticism and surviving comments from as far back as Ancient Greece. During the early 1990s, Dame Diana toured university campuses, reading excerpts from the book. All of the proceeds from the speaking tour, and the book itself, were donated to a theatrical charity."

  "text" : "\"Nietzsche contra Wagner\" is a critical essay by Friedrich Nietzsche, composed of recycled passages from his past works. It was written in his last year of lucidity (1888–1889), but was not published until 1895, six years after his mental collapse. Nietzsche describes in this short work why he parted ways with his one-time idol and friend, Richard Wagner. Nietzsche attacks Wagner's views, expressing disappointment and frustration in Wagner's life choices (such as his conversion to Christianity, perceived as a sign of weakness). Nietzsche evaluates Wagner's philosophy on tonality, music and art; he admires Wagner's power to emote and express himself, but largely disdains what Nietzsche calls his religious biases."

  "text" : "New Moon is a romantic fantasy novel by author Stephenie Meyer, and is the second novel in the Twilight series. The novel continues the story of Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen's relationship. When Edward leaves Bella after his brother attacks her, she is left heartbroken and depressed for months until Jacob Black becomes her best friend and helps her fight her pain. However, her life twists once more when Jacob's nature reveals itself and Edward's sister decides to visit. According to Meyer, the book is about losing true love. The title refers to the darkest phase of the lunar cycle, indicating that New Moon is about the darkest time of protagonist Bella Swan's life. Meyer wrote the book before Twilight was published. Writing the book was difficult for Meyer as she feared the readers' reaction to the book and often cried while describing Bella's pain. The book was originally released in hardcover on September 6, 2006 with an initial print run of 100,000 copies. Upon its publication in the United States, New Moon was highly successful and moved quickly to the top of bestseller lists, becoming one of the most anticipated books of the year. It peaked at #1 on both the New York Times Best Seller list and USA Today's Top 150 Bestsellers, and was the biggest selling children's paperback of 2008 with over 5.3 million copies sold. Moreover, New Moon was the best-selling book of 2009 and has been translated into 38 languages. A film adaptation of the book was released on November 20, 2009. Reception for New Moon was more positive than that for its predecessor. Some criticized the middle section's pacing; critics generally, however, argued the novel was more mature in tone, praising the character development and its depiction of human emotion."

  "text" : "Night and Day is a novel by Virginia Woolf first published on 20 October 1919. Set in Edwardian London, Night and Day contrasts the daily lives and romantic attachments of two acquaintances, Katharine Hilbery and Mary Datchet. The novel examines the relationships between love, marriage, happiness, and success. Dialogue and descriptions of thought and actions are used in equal amount, unlike in Woolf's later book, To the Lighthouse. There are four major characters, Katharine Hilbery, Mary Datchet, Ralph Denham, and William Rodney. Night and Day deals with issues concerning women's suffrage, if love and marriage can coexist, and if marriage is necessary for happiness. Motifs throughout the book includes the stars and sky, the River Thames, and walks. Also, Woolf makes many references to the works of William Shakespeare, especially As You Like It."

  "text" : "Nature's Garden: An Aid to Knowledge of our Wild Flowers and their Insect Visitors (1900), republished as Wild Flowers: An Aid to Knowledge of our Wild Flowers and their Insect Visitors (1901), is a book written by nature writer Neltje Blanchan and published by Doubleday, Page & Company. In order to aid the amateur botanist, it used color to classify flowers, noting that this made it easier for novices to identify specimens, and that insects also used color to identify plants. The book also explored the relationship between flowers and the insects that feed on their nectar, using rather anthropomorphic language, and discussed scientific questions of the time, such as Sprengel's theory that orchids produce no nectar. Her description of the flowers also referred to relevant poetry and folklore. Unlike her book Bird Neighbors, the photographs (by Henry Troth and A. R. Dugmore) were taken directly from nature. In discussing the Larger Blue Flag (Iris versicolor), to take one example, Blanchan notes botanical characteristics of the flower, and a preference for marshes and wet meadows, but also quotes the poet John Ruskin, mentions anecdotes involving Napoleon, and continues by discussing the pollination process: But even in the meadows of France Napoleon need not have looked far from the fleurs-de-lis growing there to find bees. Indeed, this gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it is for the bees' benefit, which, of course, is its own also. ... The large showy blossom cannot but attract the passing bee, whose favorite color (according to Sir John Lubbock) it waves. The bee alights on the convenient, spreading platform, and, guided by the dark veining and golden lines leading to the nectar, sips the delectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey. Now, as he raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary, he must rub it against the pollen-laden anther above, and some of the pollen necessarily falls on the visitor.... On publication, monthly journal The Plant World described the book as \"charming in its language, instructive and entertaining in its descriptions, and above all, fascinating in its wealth of beautifully executed illustrations,\" while The New York Times wrote that \"this kind of a popular flower book has long been wanting in America.\" In 1917, Asa Don Dickinson reorganised and substantially adapted the book as Wild Flowers Worth Knowing. The original book was republished by the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation in 2002."

According to translator Jane Kentish, this first publication was intended as \"no more than a prologue to the novel\". Further work on the novel was prevented by Dostoyevsky's arrest and exile to a Siberian detention camp for alleged participation in revolutionary activities. After his return in 1859, Dostoyevsky never resumed work on Netochka Nezvanova, leaving this fragment forever incomplete. Ann Dunnigan's American English translation of the novel was first published in 1972."

  "text" : "Nostradamus Ate My Hamster is a fantasy novel by British author Robert Rankin. In it, several seemingly unconnected and nonsensical events come together to make perfect clarity at the end; these include time travel and an attempted alien invasion vaguely orchestrated by Hitler. The plot centers on the aptly named Russell Nice, stuck in a dead-end job at a movie prop selling business, discovering holographic equipment from the future that allows the holder to create lifelike holograms of any movie star they want. Eventually, he becomes entangled in a mass of deceit, lies, and betrayal, all of which centers on a demon-god with an insect face, and Hitler, who is stuck in the present time with his SS bodyguards, intending to make a film that will influence the world to follow Hitler and his ideals. During his time travel, Russell discovers that the creature has disposed of traditional heroes Jim Pooley and John Omally before its attack; they would normally defend Brentford from the threat the creature posed, but as it exists outside the natural order it is able to destroy them before they can take action against it. Finding himself unable to simply destroy the film or prevent it being made, Russell decides to use the time-travel belts that Hitler's forces had acquired to establish himself as a major film producer in the present, thus ensuring that he will be the one that Hitler's men bring the film to, allowing him to destroy it before it is released. This victory, due to the temporally active nature of the conflict, apparently erases Russell's struggle, and the novel ends with Jim Pooley and John Omally discussing the story in the Flying Swan as a man who appears to be Russell enters the bar, and begins to talk with an attractive waitress."

The Berkley (1978) reprint adds two stories \"The Girl with the Hungry Eyes\" and \"A Bit of the Dark World\". The definitive version is the Gregg Press (1980) hardcover which adds a Foreword by Richard Gid Powers to the complete contents of the Berkley edition and is thus an expansion of the original Arkham House edition."

The book was notable in that it broke new ground in the science fiction field by postulating an alien lifeform, not hostile, which could live within the human body. Also published as From Outer Space, the book would, in 1978, spark the sequel Through the Eye of a Needle."

  "text" : "Neverwhere is the companion novelisation by Neil Gaiman of the television serial Neverwhere, by Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry. The plot and characters are exactly the same as in the series, with the exception that the novel form allowed Gaiman to expand and elaborate on certain elements of the story and restore changes made in the televised version from his original plans. Most notable is the appearance of the Floating Market at Harrods (in the novel) rather than under Battersea power station (the TV series). This is because the management of Harrods changed their minds about proposed filming. The novel was originally released by BBC Books in 1996, three episodes into the television series run. It was accompanied by a spoken word CD and cassette release, also by the BBC. The novel enjoyed great success, whereas its television roots did not receive as much international exposure as the novel. In addition to being translated into various languages, it was also re-published as an 'Author's Preferred Text' version, (a combination of the international and original English version, with additional scenes re-inserted by Gaiman) alongside American Gods in 2006. The original BBC Books version had a cover by longtime Gaiman collaborator Dave McKean, taken from the birds head rings, flaming fist and London Underground styled graphics created by McKean for the series, as well as a brief section by Gaiman on the making of the series."

  "text" : "No Treason is a composition of three essays: No.1 (1867), No.2: The Constitution (1867), and No. 6: The Constitution of no Authority (1867) (no more versions were made between No. 2 and No.6) under the authorship of Lysander Spooner. Lawyer by training, strong abolitionist, radical thinker, and anarchist, Spooner wrote these specific pamphlets in order to express his discontent with the state and its driving power, the U.S. Constitution. He strongly believed in the idea of natural law, which he also described as “the science of justice,” which he defined as “the science of all human rights; of all man’s rights of person and property; of all his rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. Natural law, as Spooner saw it, was to be part of everyone’s life, which includes the rights given at birth: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The United States government also saw natural law to be a good basis for the creation of the Constitution. The preamble itself states the liberties that all American citizens have under the protection of the United States government. Spooner believed that“if there be such a principle as justice, or natural law, it is the principle, or law, that tells us what rights were given to every human being at his birth”. This meant that the rights listed under the Constitution were granted to “the people” who Spooner thought to be everyone that was born in the United States regardless of color or gender. Being against the Civil War as a conflict for union, when it should have been about slavery, and witnessing the hardships brought along by the Reconstruction Era, Spooner felt the Constitution completely violated natural law; thus, it was voided. By allowing for the institution of slavery to take place, the United States was taking away the basic rights of the many slaves who were born in American soil. According to Spooner, the slave’s rights were to be the same as everyone else’s due to their birth qualifications. As an outspoken abolitionist, Spooner did not believe that any American should be treated differently under the natural law. In the years prior to writing No Treason, Lysander Spooner had already expressed his disapproval of slavery in his essay The Unconstitutionality of Slavery (1845, 1860), considered a “comprehensive, liberitarian theory of constitutional interpretation” by many abolitionists of his time. His main argument fell under the idea that slavery was not mentioned in the Constitution: “The constitution itself contains no designation, description, or necessary admission of the existence of such a thing as slavery, servitude, or the right of property in man. We are obliged to go out of the instrument and grope among the records of oppression, lawlessness and crime--records unmentioned, and of course unsanctioned by the constitution—to find the thing, to which it is said that the words of the constitution apply. And when we have found this thing, which the constitution dare not name, we find that the constitution has sanctioned it (if at all) only by enigmatical words, by unnecessary implication and inference, by innuendo and double entendre, and under a name that entirely fails of describing the thing” \"Although Spooner’s argument on the unconstitutionality of slavery had no legal basis, his concept of natural law contained the germs of anarchistic theory of government\", which would eventually lead to the creation of No Treason, probably his most anarchistic work as well as influential to anarchists of his time and of present day, and while each essay claims voidance of the Constitution, each emphasizes on specific aspects."

  "text" : "Nightwood is a 1936 novel by Djuna Barnes first published in London by Faber and Faber. Nightwood is one of the earliest prominent novels to portray explicit homosexuality between women, and can be considered lesbian literature. It is also notable for its intense, gothic prose style. The novel employs modernist techniques such as its unusual form or narrative and can be considered metafiction, and it was praised by other modernist authors including T. S. Eliot, who wrote an introduction included in the 1937 edition published by Harcourt, Brace. Eliot wrote in his introduction that \"... it is so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.\" As a roman à clef, the novel features a thinly veiled portrait of Barnes in the character of Nora Flood, whereas Nora’s lover Robin Vote is a composite of Thelma Wood and the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven."

  "text" : "Newtons Sleep is an original novel by Daniel O'Mahony set in the Faction Paradox universe. It is the only Faction Paradox novel to be published by Random Static. Although taking place in a shared universe, it is a stand-alone work that does not require any prior knowledge of Faction Paradox. The events of Newtons Sleep occur on Earth in the 17th century. One of the central characters of the book is the historical playwright and spy Aphra Behn. The lack of an apostrophe in the title is intentional, and alludes to both Finnegans Wake and the original punctuation of the William Blake quote from which it is drawn: \"Now I a fourfold vision see And a fourfold vision is given to me Tis fourfold in my supreme delight And three fold in soft Beulahs night And twofold Always. May God us keep From Single vision & Newtons sleep.\"— Blake, Letter to Thomas Butt, 22 November 1802. Quoted in Geoffrey Keynes (ed.), The Letters of William Blake(1956) Blake is objecting to the literalism of the Newtonian mindset. He would have us see multiple significances in everything. On the 16th of January 2009, Random Static released a free e-book edition of Newtons Sleep in pdf format."

  "text" : "Naked Came the Manatee (ISBN 978-0399141928) is a mystery thriller parody novel published in 1996. It is composed of thirteen chapters, each written by a different Miami-area writer. It was originally published as a serial in the Miami Herald's Tropic magazine, one chapter per issue, and later published as a single novel. Its title is a reference to the literary hoax Naked Came the Stranger. The book was conceived of and edited by Tom Shroder, then editor of Tropic. Dave Barry came up with the first chapter, which was then handed to the next writer, and so on until Carl Hiaasen had to tie all the loose threads together in the final chapter. Each chapter was written on deadline for publication in the magazine. The plot involves three crime-fighting characters from three of the writers' previous, non-parody, mystery/thriller works coming together to help an elderly environmentalist and her granddaughter investigate the mystery behind a package delivered by a precocious Miami-area manatee named Booger. John Dufresne opens his chapter in a spoof on Moby-Dick, with the line \"Call me Booger...\" All proceeds from the novel were donated to charity. The writers of the different chapters are: 1.  \n* Dave Barry 2.  \n* Les Standiford 3.  \n* Paul Levine 4.  \n* Edna Buchanan 5.  \n* James W. Hall 6.  \n* Carolina Hospital 7.  \n* Evelyn Mayerson 8.  \n* Tananarive Due 9.  \n* Brian Antoni 10.  \n* Vicki Hendricks 11.  \n* John Dufresne 12.  \n* Elmore Leonard 13.  \n* Carl Hiaasen"

One of the most notable differences is the treatment of the nebulae themselves, as a cosmic civilisation, peopled with recognisable characters. Two of them – Bright Heart and Fire Bolt – are treated very much as if they are human beings."

The book contains 21 chapters: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kaliningrad/Russia, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Germany. The book is presented in a diary format; Palin starts each section of the book with a heading such as \"Day Forty One: Selçuk\". Not all days are mentioned, in part a result of the trip as a whole being broken up into several shorter trips. A recurring theme in the book are the questions of how the citizens of these countries compare the current situation with the Communist years, and the expectations these people have of the future and the enlarged European Union. Palin occasionally commits glaring errors in the book. Most strikingly, he refers to the Estonian language as being made up of thousands of \"characters\", when it is in fact written in the Latin script."

The book also covers the Algerian War and Albert Camus's take on it. In vivid detail, Baldwin also recounts the Harlem childhood that shaped his early consciousness, the later painful historic events—the murders of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X along with his stay in Europe and in Hollywood and his return to the American South to confront a violent America."

  "text" : "Nuclear Nebraska: The Remarkable Story of the Little County That Couldn’t Be Bought is a 2007 book by Susan Cragin which follows the controversy about a proposed low level nuclear waste dump, which was planned for Boyd County, Nebraska. In 1989, two multinational corporations and several government agencies proposed a waste dump and offered payment of $3 million per year for 40 years. The residents of the Boyd County farming community resisted the offer and controversy followed for almost two decades. During this time, the community was transformed \"from a small group of isolated farmers to a defiant band of environmentalists\". The opposition of the community eventually succeeded, and the license to build the dump was denied. Several governors became embroiled in the controversy, as well as legislators, bureaucrats and the community. One central figure went to jail and others were dismissed from their jobs. For many years, there was extensive coverage of the event by the news media. U.S. Senator Ben Nelson wrote the foreword to the book."

Because of its presentation of anarchist philosophy in plain language, Now and After has become one of the best-known introductions to anarchism in print. Anarchist Stuart Christie wrote that Now and After is \"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\". Historian Paul Avrich described it as \"a classic\" and wrote that it was \"the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language\"."

It was illustrated by Charles H. M. Kerr. The novel tells the tale of the origin and early life of the hero Umslopogaas, the illegitimate son of the great Zulu king and general Chaka, and his love for \"the most beautiful of Zulu women\", Nada the Lily. 'Chaka was a real king of the Zulus but Umslopogaas was invented by Haggard. He first appeared as an elderly but vigorous warrior in Allan Quatermain (1887). He also appears in the novel She and Allan (1921). 'Nada the Lily' is unusual for a Victorian novel in that its entire cast of characters is South African and black. There is some anecdotal evidence that Umslopogaas might have been based on an actual person, although not as described in the book. He would have been a Swazi not a Zulu."

  "text" : "Noise is unwanted sound by the perceiver, because it is unpleasant, loud or interferes with hearing. This results in the subjective discretion between sound and noise, where any sound may be considered noise, depending on the perceiver. From a physics standpoint, noise is indistinguishable from sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound. By extension, in experimental sciences, \"noise\" refers to any random fluctuations of data that makes more difficult the perception of an expected signal. Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended. In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection. In audio engineering, it can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss. This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting."

Perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled systems. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around. Perrow's argument based on human error, big accidents tend to escalate, and technology is not the problem, the organizations are. Each of these principles is still relevant today."

  "text" : "Now the Hell Will Start: One Soldier's Flight from the Greatest Manhunt of World War II (2008) is a narrative nonfiction history book by United States author Brendan I. Koerner. It investigates and recounts the story of Herman Perry, an African-American World War II soldier assigned in the China-Burma-India theatre of the war. Perry killed a white officer while helping construct the Ledo Road. He subsequently retreated into the Indo-Burmese wilderness and joined a tribe of the headhunting Nagas, successfully joining one village and marrying the fourteen-year-old daughter of one of the tribesmen. It also relates some of the history of the CBI theatre as it pertains to Herman Perry's, as well as explores the injustices of the Jim Crow mentality and policies carried out by the military during World War II. In February 2009, American director Spike Lee purchased the film rights to the book."

It features the warm relationship between the main character, a boy of 7 years old, and his grandmother, along with the hustle and bustle of the busy day at the hot dog stand. Night of the Moonjellies also features a small, jelly-like creature found in the North Atlantic called a moonjelly. Also commonly known as a comb jelly this animal is capable of bioluminescence. Its scientific name is ctenophore (pronounced 'tee-ne-for'). The book won a Marion Vannett Ridgway Award, is featured in many educational programs and has been reprinted in several editions. In its review Smithsonian Magazine said it \"was sure to become a classic.\"1 Mark Shasha's artwork from \"Night of the Moonjellies\" has been exhibited in several museums and galleries since 1992. Singer/Songwriter Steve Elci has expressed interest in creating the score should the book ever be made into a film.2"

  "text" : "Nights in Rodanthe is a romantic love novel by American writer Nicholas Sparks in September 2002. Set in Rodanthe, North Carolina, the story follows the purely intense and close romance of a divorced mother, Adrienne Willis, and a divorced father and surgeon, Paul Flanner. The novel's two main protagonists meet in an inn in Rodanthe and fall strongly in love. However, fate and destiny falls upon them when they realize that leaving Rodanthe would mean going back to their separate lives. Sparks based parts of his story on his own life's events, particularly his courting of the woman he married, Cathy Cote. Themes of genuine romantic love, and sacrifice are incorporated in the novel. Nights in Rodanthe was adapted into a 2008 film of the same name."

  "text" : "Novelas ejemplares (\"Exemplary Novels\") is a series of twelve novellas that follow the model established in Italy, written by Miguel de Cervantes between 1590 and 1612. The collection was printed in Madrid in 1613 by Juan de la Cuesta, and received well in the wake of the first part of Don Quixote. Cervantes boasted in his foreword to have been the first to write novelas in the Spanish language: My genius and my inclination prompt me to this kind of writing; the more so as I consider (and with truth) that I am the first who has written novels in the Spanish language, though many have hitherto appeared among us, all of them translated from foreign authors. But these are my own, neither imitated nor stolen from anyone; my genius has engendered them, my pen has brought them forth, and they are growing up in the arms of the press. The novellas are usually grouped into two series: those characterized by an idealized nature and those of a realistic nature. Those idealized in nature, which are the closest to the Italian models, are characterized by plots dealing with amorous entanglements, by improbable plots, by the presence of idealized characters and psychological development, and the low reflection of reality. They include: El amante liberal, Las dos doncellas, La española inglesa, La señora Cornelia and La fuerza de la sangre. These were the most popular of the novellas at the time. The realistic in nature cater to the descriptions of realistic characters and environments, with intentional criticism in many cases. The realistic in nature are the best-known stories today: Rinconete y Cortadillo, El licenciado Vidriera, La gitanilla, El casamiento engañoso (which leads directly into the fantasy El coloquio de los perros), and La ilustre fregona. However, the separation between the two groups is not sharp and elements of the idealistic may be found in some of the realistic novels. Since there are multiple versions of two of these stories, it is believed that Cervantes introduced some variations in these novels for moral, social and aesthetic purposes (hence the name 'exemplary'). The more primitive versions were found in the manuscript, now lost, called by the name of its one-time possessor, Porras de la Cámara, a miscellaneous collection of various literary works which include a novel usually attributed to Cervantes, La tía fingida. On the other hand, some short stories are also embedded in Don Quixote, such as El curioso impertinente or Historia del cautivo, and where a character possesses a manuscript of Rinconete y Cortadillo, unpublished at the time (1605)."

  "text" : "Non-Nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy is a 1975 book by Amory B. Lovins and John H. Price. The main theme of the book is that the most important parts of the nuclear power debate are not technical disputes but relate to personal values, and are the legitimate province of every citizen, whether technically trained or not. Lovins and Price suggest that the personal values that make a high-energy society work are all too apparent, and that the values associated with an alternate view relate to thrift, simplicity, diversity, neighbourliness, craftsmanship, and humility. They also argue that large nuclear generators could not be mass-produced. Their centralization requires costly transmission and distribution systems. They are inefficient, not recycling excess thermal energy. They are much less reliable and take longer to build, exposing them to escalated interest costs, mistimed demand forecasts, and wage pressure by unions. Lovins and Price suggest that these two different sets of personal values and technological attributes lead to two very different policy paths relating to future energy supplies. The first is high-energy nuclear, centralized, electric; the second is lower energy, non-nuclear, decentralized, less electrified, softer technology. Subsequent publications by other authors which relate to the issue of non-nuclear energy paths are Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, Plan B 2.0, Reaction Time, State of the World 2008, The Clean Tech Revolution, and the work of Benjamin K. Sovacool."

Until Nancy Mitford wrote \"The English Aristocracy\" in an article published in 1955, England was blissfully unconscious of 'U' ('Upperclass') usage. Her article sparked off a public debate, whose counterblasts are collected in this book, published one year later. Although the subtitle rather drily suggests it as an enquiry into the identifying characteristics of members of the English upper-class, it is really more of a debate, with each essayist entertaining and convincing."

  "text" : "This article is about Kate Atkinson's book of short stories. For Geraldine McCaughrean's young adult novel, see Not the End of the World (young adult novel); for Christopher Brookmyre's crime novel, see Not the End of the World (crime novel) Not the End of the World is a short story collection by British writer Kate Atkinson. It is mostly set in Scotland, and is an experiment in magic realism. The collection was first published in 2002 by Doubleday. It contains 12 loosely connected stories: 1.  \n* \"Charlene and Trudi Go Shopping\": Two women obsessively make unreal and bizarre lists, managing to lead apparently normal lives, oblivious to the reality around them which is of the city being torn apart by an apocalyptic war. 2.  \n* \"Tunnel of Fish\": A pregnant mother living in Edinburgh with her partner Hawk, worries about her fish-obsessed son Eddie and reminisces about the past including her first holiday abroad to Crete during which Eddie was conceived; she has a vivid memory of being dragged down to the Mediterranean sea-bed and ravaged by an undersea god. On his birthday Eddie is taken to Deep Sea World where in the undersea tunnel he receives a message from a giant carp. 3.  \n* \"Transparent Fiction\": Meredith Zane (one of the Zane sisters) is working her way around Europe but has come to a halt in London where she finds herself living with Fletcher, a writer for a television soap Green Acres. The night before she plans to leave Fletcher and continue her tour they are invited to a dinner party by a television producer at which Meredith meets Merle Goldeman who appears to have been alive for millennia. Meredith determines to steal the secret of eternal life for herself. 4.  \n* \"Dissonance\": Rebecca and Simon live with their divorced mother Pam. Simon spends most of his time in his room playing Tekken 3 on his PlayStation, listening to Korn and 'Boak' on his stereo and making occasional trips out to shoplift and skateboard. Rebecca in contrast is studying hard for her highers listening to classical music, and plans to study medicine at university. 5.  \n* \"Sheer Big Waste of Love\": Addison Fox was orphaned at the age of eight. His mother, a prostitute is dying of cancer attempts to reunite Addison with his father, a successful local businessman. As a result of this meeting Addison, his mother and an innocent bystander end up in casualty. 6.  \n* \"Unseen Translation\": Missy has just become nanny for Arthur, the eight-year-old son of glamour model Romney Wright and the lead singer of a rock band 'Boak'. Arthur's father is on tour in Germany and Missy is to take Arthur to visit him. 7.  \n* \"Evil Doppelgangers\": Fielding, who is media correspondent for a newspaper, suspects he has a doppelganger who is having far more fun than himself and creating havoc in the process. Fielding resolves to track him down. 8.  \n* \"The Cat Lover\": After breaking up with her boyfriend Fletcher (a television scriptwriter), Heidi is followed home by a dishevelled cat. She names the cat Gordon and it soon takes over her flat, eating more and more food and growing ever larger, until Heidi wonders when she will be eaten herself. Gordon also becomes more and more human and eventually begins sleeping in Heidi's bed. 9.  \n* \"The Bodies Vest\": Vincent is well acquainted with death. He remembers his father falling from the fourth-floor window he was trying to clean. And then the death of his new wife (one of the Zane sisters) who died whilst having a wisdom tooth extracted. Her father (a dentist) then kills himself. 10.  \n* \"Temporal Anomaly\": Marianne dies in a road accident on the M9. She wakes to find herself sitting on the hard shoulder and stumbles into the nearby Little Chef but cannot make herself noticed, then she walks the four miles home. 11.  \n* \"Wedding Favours\": Pam's son Simon has now left home. Soon Pam finds herself in business with her friend Maggie producing wedding favours. 12.  \n* \"Pleasureland\": Charlene and Trudi (from the first story in the collection) soon find themselves boarded up in Trudi's flat, the whole building being declared a plague area. With electricity failing and food running out they tell each other tales of the Greek gods. The narrative ends with Trudi telling Charlene \"Don't worry, it's not the end of the world\"."

  "text" : "Nostalgia is a novel by the Romanian writer Mircea Cărtărescu. The narrative consists of five distinct parts which assiduously link together to produce a narrative that is on the one hand disjointed and on the other produces, as a whole, a kind of hidden centre while negotiation the Romanian relationship to time and place, state and nationalism, communism and community, the rural and the capital with a neurotic, hallucinatory fervor that itself seems an exhalation of all of these anxieties. First appearing in Romania under the name Visul (\"The Dream\") in 1989 with Cartea Româneasca Publishing House, having been mangled by censors, it appeared in its full form as Nostalgia in 1993 under Humanitas. It was thereafter translated into French, German, Hungarian, Spanish and other languages, and was nominated for literary prizes across Europe. In 2005, the novel was translated to English by Julian Semilian and published by New Directions. While sharply distinct from the realist narrative mode typifying North American literature, it was received with rave reviews by critics across the United States."

Harris attempts to explain why people are so different in personality, even identical twins who grow up in the same home. No Two Alike expands on some of the ideas from her previous book The Nurture Assumption, especially the effect of birth order on personality and criticism of developmental psychology. She also attempts to answer some of the criticisms leveled at The Nurture Assumption. Harris proposes that three distinct mental systems shape personality: \n* A relationship system that allows us to distinguish family from strangers and tell individuals apart. \n* A socialization system that helps us to become members of a group and absorb the group's culture. \n* A status system that enables us to acquire self-knowledge by measuring ourselves against others."

  "text" : "Nineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English author George Orwell published in 1949.The novel is set in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain), a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance and public manipulation, dictated by a political system euphemistically named English Socialism (or Ingsoc in the government's invented language, Newspeak) under the control of a privileged elite of the Inner Party, that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as \"thoughtcrime.\" The tyranny is epitomised by Big Brother, the Party leader who enjoys an intense cult of personality but who may not even exist. The Party \"seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.\" The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, is a member of the Outer Party, who works for the Ministry of Truth (or Minitrue in Newspeak), which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. His job is to rewrite past newspaper articles, so that the historical record always supports the party line. The instructions that the workers receive specify the corrections as fixing misquotations and never as what they really are: forgeries and falsifications. A large part of the ministry also actively destroys all documents that have been edited and do not contain the revisions; in this way, no proof exists that the government is lying. Smith is a diligent and skillful worker but secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother. Orwell based the character of the heroine of the novel, Julia, on his second wife, Sonia Orwell. As literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a classic novel in content, plot and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, Room 101, telescreen, 2 + 2 = 5, and memory hole, have entered into common use since its publication in 1949. Nineteen Eighty-Four popularised the adjective Orwellian, which describes official deception, secret surveillance and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state. In 2005, the novel was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 13 on the editor's list, and 6 on the readers' list. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 8 on the BBC's survey The Big Read."

Paige introduces the concept of Nonkilling, which refers to the absence of killing, threats to kill, and conditions conducive to killing in human society. By 2009 the book was being translated into 34 languages  and had led to convening the First Global Nonkilling Leadership Forum in Honolulu, Hawai‘i, 1–4 November 2007."

The tales are completely Andersen's invention, owe no debt to folk or fairy lore, and are the most autobiographical of his several fairy tale collections. The collection was received enthusiastically by the Danish critics and public and became Andersen's break-through in the fairy tale genre. \"The Nightingale\" and \"The Ugly Duckling\" have been adapted to various forms of drama."

  "text" : "Night of the Grizzlies (1969) is a book by Jack Olsen which details events surrounding the night of August 13, 1967, when two young women were separately attacked in Glacier National Park, Montana, by grizzly bears. Both women, Julie Helgeson, 19, of Albert Lea, Minnesota, and Michele Koons, 19, of San Diego, California, died of their injuries. Olsen's book examines the most plausible explanation of the unlikely dual attacks since no fatal grizzly attack had ever been recorded in the park's 57-year history prior to that night. One specialist at the time calculated the odds were greater than 1 in a million for a single attack but the odds of two separate attacks in a 4 hour time span were beyond measure. However future events would show grizzly attacks to become more common, as Olson explains, because of increased human presence in wilderness areas and decreased habitat for bears to live in, reaching a critical tipping point in the summer of 1967. The text was originally published in 1969 as a three-part article for Sports Illustrated. A 37 page prologue was added for the book."

Originally written by Eknath Easwaran in English, foreign editions have also been published in Arabic and several other languages. The book was originally published in the United States in 1984 as A Man to Match His Mountains: Badshah Khan, nonviolent soldier of Islam. A second edition was published in 1999 with the title Nonviolent soldier of Islam: Badshah Khan, a man to match his mountains. Both editions include an afterword by Timothy Flinders. The 1999 US edition contains a new foreword by Easwaran, and an enlarged section of photographs of Khan. The book has been reviewed in magazines, newspapers, and professional journals. The book inspired the making of the 2008 film The Frontier Gandhi: Badshah Khan, a Torch for Peace."

  "text" : "Noah's Brother is a children's novel by the British author Dick King-Smith, first published in 1985. It looks at Noah's previously unknown older brother, Yessah - nicknamed as such by his nephews after the response he gives to his brother's orders, his full name of Hazardikladoran being too much of a mouthful - and his role in the Ark's construction and journey, Yessah being essentially used as a servant by his family. During the novel, Yessah befriends two white doves, 'Peace' and 'Goodwill', who become his friends during the Ark's voyage. He also saves the Ark from sinking at one point when the lower decks become too waterlogged, resulting in the portholes starting to sink under the water; by having the large animals plug the portholes with their bottoms, he is able to buy time to pump the water out. After Peace is sent away to find land, the Ark eventually stops, with the rest of the family leaving the Ark while Yessah is out searching the mountain of Ararat. Despite his solitude, Yessah concludes that he has a good life, living for the rest of his life with Peace and Goodwill."

  "text" : "A nomad (Greek: νομάς, nomas, plural νομάδες, nomades; meaning one roaming about for pasture, pastoral tribe) is a member of a community of people who live in different locations, moving from one place to another. Among the various ways nomads relate to their environment, one can distinguish the hunter-gatherer, the pastoral nomad owning livestock, or the \"modern\" peripatetic nomad.As of 1995, there were an estimated 30–40 million nomads in the world. Nomadic hunting and gathering, following seasonally available wild plants and game, is by far the oldest human subsistence method. Pastoralists raise herds, driving them, and/or moving with them, in patterns that normally avoid depleting pastures beyond their ability to recover. Nomadism is also a lifestyle adapted to infertile regions such as steppe, tundra, or ice and sand, where mobility is the most efficient strategy for exploiting scarce resources. For example, many groups in the tundra are reindeer herders and are semi-nomadic, following forage for their animals. These nomads sometimes adapt the use of high technology such as solar photovoltaics to reduce their dependence on diesel fuel. Sometimes also described as \"nomadic\" are the various itinerant populations who move about in densely populated areas living not on natural resources, but by offering services (craft or trade) to the resident population. These groups are known as \"peripatetic nomads\"."

  "text" : "Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu is a monograph by Shigeo Kurata on the tropical pitcher plants of Mount Kinabalu and the surrounding area of Kinabalu National Park in Sabah, Borneo. It was published in 1976 by Sabah National Parks Trustees as the second booklet of the Sabah National Parks series. The monograph is Kurata's most important work on Nepenthes and significantly contributed to popular interest in these plants. It is noted for its high quality colour photographs of plants in habitat. In the book's preface, Kurata writes: While Nepenthes were often enumerated as an important component of the flora of this mountain, a book on this genus—relating exclusively to Kinabalu had never been published to this date. With such a situation and the interest shown by visitors to the Kinabalu National Park in the genus, Mr. D.V. Jenkins, Assistant Director, Sabah National Parks was prompted to publish a guide book on the species found within the park and I was delighted to be asked to write the text. The book's coverage was mostly restricted to the southern slopes of Mount Kinabalu, as the rest of the mountain remained largely unexplored at the time. Kurata recognised 16 species from Mount Kinabalu: N. alata (now known to be endemic to the Philippines), N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata, N. burbidgeae, N. edwardsiana, N. fusca, N. gracilis, N. lowii, N. mirabilis, N. rafflesiana, N. rajah, N. reinwardtiana, N. stenophylla, N. tentaculata, N. villosa, and an undescribed species (\"Nepenthes sp.\"; later described as N. macrovulgaris). Several of these species had not been reported from Kinabalu National Park at the time, but were expected to be found there due to their presence in surrounding areas. Three named natural hybrids were also covered in detail: N. × harryana, N. × hookeriana, and N. × kinabaluensis, the last of which was named by Kurata for the first time in the book. Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu also made one of the earliest mentions of N. hamata (under the name N. dentata), a species that would be formally described 8 years after the book's publication. Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu was reviewed by Donna Scott in a 1984 issue of the Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Journal."

  "text" : "Nine Coaches Waiting is a then-contemporary suspense, Gothic Romance novel by Mary Stewart published originally in 1958. The setting is the late 1950s — contemporary to the time of its first publication. The novel tells the haunting tale of a young English governess, Linda Martin, who travels to the Château Valmy, near Thonon-les-Bains, France, to take care of nine-year-old Philippe de Valmy. There she finds herself tangled in a plot to murder her charge and tries to save him, which eventually results in the revelation of a dark secret. Linda's name is short for Belinda, \"or for pretty\" as her mother used to say, but she goes by Linda throughout the book. In keeping with Linda's background in poetry and other literature, Stewart employs chapter epigraphs with quotes from the works of numerous poets, playwrights, and authors, that fit the themes or actions of each scene. Among these are lines from Macbeth, King John, and Hamlet, by William Shakespeare, as well as from his Sonnets 88 and 90. Others are from John Milton; Charles Dickens; John Keats; Alfred, Lord Tennyson; Elizabeth Barrett Browning; Robert Browning John Donne; George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham; William Blake; George Meredith; and John Webster. All epigraphs are much briefer than Cyril Tourneur's lines that head the first chapter and whence Stewart derived the book's title. (See notes.) A good example is that from King John that introduces Chapter VIII: Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer. There is none yet so ugly a fiend in hell As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child. And the final epigraph (at Chapter XXI):Look you, the stars shine still.— John Webster, The Duchess of Malfi Cinderella is referred to by Linda, as is Jane Eyre, for obvious reasons. Mary Stewart's vast literary knowledge and background is particularly, yet seamlessly, manifest in this book."

  "text" : "Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea is a part-novelization (2009) of interviews with refugees from Chongjin, North Korea, written by Los Angeles Times journalist Barbara Demick. In 2010, the book was awarded the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. It was also a nonfiction finalist for the National Book Award in 2010. The title comes from the children's theme song of the 1970 North Korean film We Have Nothing to Envy in the World (Chosŏn'gŭl: 세상에 부럼 없어라; RR: Sesang-e burom opsora). Demick interviewed more than 100 defectors and chose to focus on Chongjin because it is likely to be more representative than the capital Pyongyang. Demick briefly discusses the examination of one of the female characters into a position of Kippumjo. The events covered include the famine of the 1990s, with the final chapters describing the route the main characters took to Seoul and then an epilogue describing the effects of the November 30, 2009 currency reform."

  "text" : "Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist is an historical novel by historian of science Russell McCormmach, published in 1982 by Harvard University Press. Set in 1918, the book explores the world of physics in the early 20th century—including the advent of modern physics and the role of physicists in World War I—through the recollections of the fictional Viktor Jakob. Jakob is an old German physicist who spent most of his career during the period of classical physics, a paradigm being confronted by the rapid and radical developments of relativistic physics in 1900s and 1910s. This conflict allows for extensive examination of the various tensions placed on Jakob by the academic environment, the German academic system, and the changing academic culture of the early 20th century. The character of Jakob, a professor at a minor German university, is an amalgam of German physicists based on archival research by McCormmach. In the novel, he recalls interactions and events, documented in extensive footnotes to genuine publications and archival sources, involving many of the well-known physicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Night Thoughts, pointedly criticized for its lack of literary merit by some reviewers, was generally praised for its attempt at forging a new approach to history and historical fiction by incorporating extensive research into the text."

  "text" : "Now I Know is a young adult novel by Aidan Chambers, first published in 1987. It is a meditation on faith and religion through three interlinked stories, which are told by means of letters, jottings, flashbacks, poetry and puzzles. The novel is part of the author's Dance Sequence, a group of novels which stand alone but can be read in relation to each other. As part of Chambers' interest in experimental writing, he refers to Tom Phillip's remarkable A Humument: a Treated Victorian Novel (Thames & Hudson, 1980), a modern work that is created from the pages of an actual Victorian novel by painting over most of the words of the original, creating illustrations and decorations, while leaving enough of the original words on each page to tell a total new story. Chambers includes a similar experimental collage-like page of image and text."

  "text" : "Net.wars is a non-fiction book by journalist Wendy M. Grossman about conflict and controversy among stakeholders on the Internet. It was published by NYU Press in 1997, and was simultaneously made available free as an online version. The book discusses conflicts which arose during the growth of the Internet from 1993 through 1997, labeled by Grossman as \"boundary disputes\". These disputes deal with issues including privacy, encryption, copyright, censorship, sex, and pornography. The author discusses history of organizations in their attempts to enforce their intellectual property on the Internet, against individuals who attempted to reveal confidential materials asserting it was in the public interest. Grossman frames these disputes with respect to overarching rights of freedom of speech and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book received a positive reception, and was described by Technology Review as \"one of the first comprehensive reports on the upheavals underway in cyberspace.\" Publishers Weekly praised the depth of discussion in the book, and Library Journal commented positively on the history and background imparted. New Scientist gave the book a favorable review, commenting, \"Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative book about the complexity and challenges of the Net.\" Reason magazine observed, \"Grossman has written an intriguing account of the Internet's partial fulfillment of its seemingly limitless promise.\""

It corresponds temporally to part of Nin's published diaries. It consists mainly of material that was left out of the published version because it would have hurt people involved or their relationships with Anaïs Nin had it been published at the time. The book displays the range of Nin's moods and emotions. She avoided re-writing or writing long afterward, when possible, in order to preserve the truth about how she felt at the time of each entry. As the diaries go on, they become more poetical or stream of consciousness, as opposed to objective. She is sometimes very explicit about her sexual activity and how she feels about it. The sources of some of her erotic stories can be recognized here. Generally the bazaar Latin American settings for some of her stories were first written down here, as told her by Gonzalo Moré and his wife Helba. The contrasts between her various emotional and sexual relationships as well as the fluctuations in each are very striking and clear."

  "text" : "Never Mind the Balkans, Here's Romania is a collection of 57 short stories by Mike Ormsby, published by Editura Compania in Bucharest, Romania in May 2008, with an E-book version published on Amazon in June 2012. The Romanian language version Grand Bazar România sau Călător străin updated, translated by Vlad A. Arghir, was published simultaneously.The book gained significant and widespread attention from Romania's literary critics in print, broadcast and online media. Most praised its realistic tone, tragicomic style and accessible format. Some reviewers described the author as 'a British Ion Luca Caragiale', and one perceived a direct link to foreign travel writers of previous centuries in Romania, such as John Paget, James Henry Skene, Emily Gerard and Sacheverell Sitwell. Another likened Ormsby’s style to that of a portrait artist, and, in terms of contemporary peers, he was compared to Irish writer Philip Ó Ceallaigh. However, one journalist suggested that the book represents an indictment of Romania by a foreign guest. General public response to the book was positive, at home and abroad. Three of Ormsby's stories were subsequently included in the 2011 anthology Bucharest Tales, published by New Europe Writers."

Among other things, the work contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. Other authors such as August Derleth and Clark Ashton Smith also cited it in their works; Lovecraft approved, believing such common allusions built up \"a background of evil verisimilitude.\" Many readers have believed it to be a real work, with booksellers and librarians receiving many requests for it; pranksters have listed it in rare book catalogues, and a student smuggled a card for it into the Yale University Library's card catalog. Capitalizing on the notoriety of the fictional volume, real-life publishers have printed many books entitled Necronomicon since Lovecraft's death."

  "text" : "Neoconservatism (commonly shortened to neocon) is a political movement born in the United States during the 1960s among conservative leaning Democrats who became disenchanted with the party's foreign policy. Many of its adherents became politically famous during the Republican presidential administrations of the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Neoconservatives peaked in influence during the administration of George W. Bush, when they played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Prominent neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration included Paul Wolfowitz, John Bolton, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Bremer. Senior officials Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, while not identifying as neoconservatives, listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel and the promotion of democracy in the Middle East. The term \"neoconservative\" refers to those who made the ideological journey from the anti-Stalinist Left to the camp of American conservatism. Neoconservatives typically advocate the promotion of democracy and promotion of American national interest in international affairs, including by means of military force and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism. The movement had its intellectual roots in the Jewish monthly review magazine Commentary, published by the American Jewish Committee. They spoke out against the New Left and in that way helped define the movement. C. Bradley Thompson, a professor at Clemson University, claims that most influential neoconservatives refer explicitly to the theoretical ideas in the philosophy of Leo Strauss (1899–1973),though in doing so they may draw upon meaning that Strauss himself did not endorse."

This NSDD positioned the White House and the National Security Staff at the helm of public diplomacy coordination across government agencies. NSDD-77 lay the groundwork for the Reagan administration's aggressive public diplomacy strategy and included guidance for inter-agency working groups to execute wide ranging tactics for information dissemination both domestically and internationally. A National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) or Presidential Directive is a written order from the President of the U.S. It is a form of an executive order issued by the President of the United States with the advice of the National Security Council. By NSDD a President gives instructions to senior advisors and departments concerning foreign policy matters."

Main themes are related to Gandhi's practice of maintaining silence one day a week, accommodations made in school for an especially loud and talkative fifth-grade group of students, gender dynamics (in elementary school), and the civil disobedience those students find themselves practicing when their \"right to remain silent\" is questioned by the school's teachers. The contest goes on and on until they meet on decision. The Principal thought she was dreaming when she saw that the fifth grade hall was so silent at lunch. Later, she joined in the competition. Lynsey and Dave are the team captains, Lynsey for the girls and Dave for the boys. Both teams have agreed that when teachers ask them a question, they are only allowed to say three words. Both teams have noticed a lot of ways to make noises without saying a word. The book won the 2010 California Young Reader Medal."

  "text" : "No Moon Tonight is a World War II autobiographical book by Halifax/Lancaster/Wellington bomber navigator Don Charlwood. Born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1915 Charlwood joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940 and was trained in Canada via the Empire Air Training Scheme. The book covers his training and his experiences as part of the RAF's Bomber Command, and his crew's ordeal completing their tour of operations. The book's title is derived from a line in the song Tristesse that was often played in the mess before a mission. In the autumn of 1942 he crewed up with a fellow Australian pilot Geoff Maddern from Western Australia and a British crew to fly a single combat mission to Bremen in a Wellington bomber from RAF Lichfield on 13 September 1942. Subsequently posted to No 103 Squadron at RAF Elsham Wolds his crew converted to fly Lancaster bombers for the rest of their tour. Whilst at Elsham, Charlwood recounts the mounting losses being suffered by Bomber Command's air offensive against the strongly defended cities such as Essen, Düsseldorf and Duisburg in Germany and the thoughts of the crew as they approach the end of their 30 missions after seven months at Elsham. Throughout the narrative, Charlwood details how his training group of navigators - The Twenty Men - are killed, injured or taken prisoner. Only a handful manage to survive the war. After completing his tour of operations, Charlwood became an instructor with No 103 Squadron, and was then posted back to Australia. Whilst heading home via Canada, he became reacquainted with Nell East, a girl he had courted whilst training in Canada, and married her. He was demobbed from the RAAF on 31 July 1945 and subsequently worked for 30 years worked for the Department of Civil Aviation, initially as an Air Traffic Controller, and later as a trainer. A companion book to No Moon Tonight appeared in 1991 and was entitled Journeys Into Night."

  "text" : "Nemesis (Bengali: নেমেসিস, Greek: Νέμεσις) is a play written by Nurul Momen, considered one of the most successful experimental plays in Bangladeshi theatre. It is a play with only one character, written in 1944 and published as a book in 1948. Nemesis, a tragedy, set a milestone in the history of Bengali plays because of its unique feature and modern plot. National professor of Bangladesh Kabir Chowdhury explains, “Nemesis is his (Nurul Momen's) most famous work. It is an experimental drama where through dialogues the main and only character remembers his past. It shows how a promising personality falls prey to greed and loses his morality. Though it is a play based on one actor, the scope of the plot is wide and a number of other characters come in through the main character's reminiscences.” It was also the first experimental Bengali play, as Nemesis contains only one character. This experiment was done earlier than Nurul Momen only by Eugene O'Neill and Jean Cocteau in the entire history of world theater. In fact, the two plays Rupantor and Nemesis by Nurul Momen, ushered in the modernism of theatre of East Bengal, subsequently called East Pakistan and finally becoming the independent Bangladesh. Before Nemesis only a few playwrights had attempted a one-character play, but none had the full form of a play continuing for one and a half hours without break. Nurul Momen did not only adorn the play with witty dialogues, but also made the character recite poems and even sing. His conversations over the phone, with neighbours, with his conscience and lastly with his murderer is drawn in such an ingenious way that the absence of these characters on the stage is never felt. Not for once the audience can get bored because of the unpredictable turn of the events cleverly knitted in the plot. Written against the backdrop of Bengal famine of the early 1940s, Nemesis depicts the moral predicaments of a middle-class schoolteacher Surojit Nandi. Surojit married Sulota, daughter of the dishonest, affluent Nripen Bose. Nripen gives Surojit an ultimatum that if he [Surojit] can not earn five hundred thousand Taka within three months, he won't accept the latter's marriage to his daughter.Surojit is left with no other option but to undertake several unethical actions. Eventually he wants to break free from the wrong path but he is denied by Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance."

  "text" : "Nonviolence (from Sanskrit ahimṣā, non-violence, \"lack of desire to harm or kill\") is the personal practice of being harmless to self and others under every condition. It comes from the belief that hurting people, animals or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and refers to a general philosophy of abstention from violence based on moral, religious or spiritual principles. Mahavira (599 BCE–527 BCE), the twenty-fourth tirthankara of the Jain religion, was the torch-bearer of \"ahimsa\" and introduced the word to the world and applied the concept in his own life. He taught that to attain nirvana, one must abstain from violence. Nonviolence also has 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and social change. Thus, for example, the Tolstoy and Gandhian non violence is a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of violence, but at the same time sees nonviolent action (also called civil resistance) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, civil disobedience, nonviolent direct action, and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention. In modern times, nonviolent methods of action have been a powerful tool for social protest and revolutionary social and political change. There are many examples of their use. Fuller surveys may be found in the entries on civil resistance, nonviolent resistance and nonviolent revolution. Here certain movements particularly influenced by a philosophy of nonviolence should be mentioned, including Mahatma Gandhi leading a successful decades-long nonviolent struggle against British rule in India, Martin Luther King's and James Bevel's adoption of Gandhi's nonviolent methods in their campaigns to win civil rights for African Americans, and César Chávez's campaigns of nonviolence in the 1960s to protest the treatment of farm workers in California. The 1989 \"Velvet Revolution\" in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government is considered one of the most important of the largely nonviolent Revolutions of 1989. Most recently the nonviolent campaigns of Leymah Gbowee and the women of Liberia were able to achieve peace after a 14-year civil war. This story is captured in a 2008 documentary film Pray the Devil Back to Hell. In an essay, \"To Abolish War,\" evolutionary biologist Judith Hand advocated the use of nonviolent direct action to dismantle the global war machine. The term \"nonviolence\" is often linked with or used as a synonym for peace, and despite being frequently equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists. Nonviolence refers specifically to the absence of violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing. Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. So If a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person. \"Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon. Indeed, it is a weapon unique in history, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it.\"— Martin Luther King, Jr., The Quest for Peace and Justice (1964) Martin Luther King's Nobel Lecture, delivered in the Auditorium of the University of Oslo at December 11, 1964"

  "text" : "National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody is an American humor book that was first published in 1973. It was a spin-off from National Lampoon magazine. The book was a parody of a high school yearbook from the early 1960s. It was edited by P. J. O'Rourke and Doug Kenney and art directed by David Kaestle. Much of the writing was by P. J. O'Rourke and Doug Kenney. The \"literary magazine\" was written by Sean Kelly; the sports page was by Christopher Cerf; and the Principal's Letter and the \"In Memorium\" piece were both by Ed Subitzky. The parody is closely based on the Devilbiss High School (Toledo, OH) yearbook - the Pot 'o Gold. O'Rourke attended DHS for a couple of years in the early 1960s. The swim team photo caption contains the names of a number of O'Rourke's friends from Devilbiss. Like many great parodies, the Lampoon yearbook is only a degree or two from the original. The publication also included a copy of the school newspaper, a basketball program, a report card, a diploma, detention slips and a fake ID. According to apparent inscriptions, the book belonged to \"Larry Kroger\", class of '64. The character Larry Kroger went on to become the college freshman protagonist (played by Tom Hulce) of the comedy movie National Lampoon's Animal House, released in 1978. The character \"Mandy Pepperidge\" also makes her first appearance in the Yearbook and reappears in the film (played by Mary Louise Weller). It is also the first mention of Fawn Rosenberg—the sorority sister whose death was credited to \"kiln explosion.\" The book, as it was originally published, appeared to be a genuine yearbook from \"C. Estes Kefauver High School\" in \"Dacron, Ohio\" (a reference to the city Akron, Ohio, and to inexpensive synthetic fabric Dacron.) Five years after the Yearbook parody, in 1978, the National Lampoon published the National Lampoon Sunday Newspaper Parody, a fake Sunday newspaper which also claimed to originate in \"Dacron, Ohio\" but was contemporary, being dated Sunday February 12, 1978."

  "text" : "National Lampoon The Gentleman's Bathroom Companion was a humorous book that was first published in 1975. It was a \"special edition\" of National Lampoon magazine, and as such it was sold on newsstands in addition to that month's regular issue of the magazine. The pieces in the book were created by regular contributors to the National Lampoon including Michael O'Donoghue, Henry Beard, Doug Kenney, Sean Kelly, Tony Hendra, P.J. O'Rourke and Ed Subitzky as well as Terry Southern and William Burroughs. The content was mostly, but not entirely, complied from material that had already been published in the magazine. The book cover art is a photograph which parodies a series of 1970s TV commercials advertising a blue toilet bowl cleanser in which a tiny man (known as the Ty-D-Bol man), wearing a neat nautical outfit and a yachting cap, was seen motoring around the inside of a toilet cistern in a tiny boat, always by himself. On the book cover parody, the Ty-D-Bol man is playing the ukulele and has a beautiful female companion in a bikini, however, the cistern is about to be flushed. The Ty-D-Bol man was played by Ed Subitzky. A description (or possibly a subtitle) on the cover reads: Being a Miscellany of Divers Ribald Drolleries Culled from the Pages of the National Lampoon, to which are appended Sundry Amusing Sketches by Mr. Sam Gross, Esq., and the Latest Novella by Mr. Chris Miller, B.A."

Other songs were from the album Goodbye Pop. There were also some visual print pieces (illustrations and photographs) included. The first piece in the songbook is Deteriorata, which was on the album Radio Dinner. The musical arrangements were by Dan Fox.The songbook was edited by Sean Kelly. The cover illustrations was a drawing showing a number of musicians on stage and a row of the audience. The drawing was a group effort by cartoonists Randall Enos, Gahan Wilson, Bobby London, Jeff Jones, Shary Fleniken and Charles Rodrigues. The songbook was designed by the design studio Pellegrini, Kaestle & Gross, Inc."

  "text" : "National Lampoon Presents The Very Large Book of Comical Funnies is an American humor book, a book of comic strips that was published in 1975 in paperback as a spin-off of National Lampoon magazine. Although it appears to be a book, in reality it was a \"special issue\" of the magazine and as such it was sold on newsstands. On the cover it is described as \"A never before published history of the comics\" and it is also described as \"An Adult Comic\". It was not an anthology; it was a collection of original material written by the Lampoon's regular contributors especially for the book. It was edited by Sean Kelly. Apparently this book grew into a series: there were two follow-up books with the same title, but with the numbers #2 and #3 added. #3 was published in 1986. The \"history\" aspect of the book included a comic strip, a family feature, which supposedly was created in the 1950s. This was \"The Appletons\" by B. K. Taylor.Another strip was a parody of Bill Mauldin's World War II strip \"Willie and Joe\", called \"Bill Maudlin's Billie and Moe\", drawn by Warren Sattler."

  "text" : "Nietzsche and Asian Thought is an anthology of essays by a variety of contributors on the relationship of the thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to Asian philosophy; specifically, Indian, Chinese and Japanese philosophy. The book was edited by American philosopher Graham Parkes and was released in 1991 by the University of Chicago Press. The work was written for a Western audience of Nietzsche scholars and comparative philosophers, but features contributions from non-Western thinkers. The work is split into four sections—Others, India, China and Japan—and each section contains between three and four essays, for a total of 14 articles by 13 different authors. The work was well received by academic reviewers upon its release, and praised as a \"must-read\" for both Nietzsche scholars and comparative philosophers. In 2004, a special edition of The Journal of Nietzsche Studies was published, aiming to build upon the scholarship in Nietzsche and Asian Thought."

Although it appears to be a regular book, it was a \"special issue\" of National Lampoon magazine, and therefore was sold on newsstands rather than in bookstores. The book was a collection of new material and was not an anthology of already published material. The \"199th Birthday\" of the title is a reference to the fact that in 1976 the United States celebrated its 200th birthday, (the Bicentennial), thus in 1975 when this book was published the United States was 199 years old. The cover art was photographed by Arky & Barrett was conceived and art-directed by Michael C. Gross. It shows a row of four naked female models whose skin has been colored with bodypaint so they resemble the \"Betsy Ross flag\" with a star for the first American states, previously the Thirteen Colonies. The three naked models on the left wear dark wigs and the one on the right has a red wig, so that even their hair reflects the pattern of the flag. The editor of the book was Tony Hendra. Contributors included Doug Kenney, P.J. O'Rourke, Michael O'Donoghue, Frank Frazetta, Sam Gross, Bobby London, Gahan Wilson, Jeff Jones, George Evans, and the illustrator Noel Sickles."

  "text" : "Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World is an academic anthology edited by the British religious studies scholars Joanne Pearson, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel which was published by Edinburgh University Press in 1998. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Pagan studies, the book examines different forms of contemporary Paganism as practiced in Europe and North America. Divided into three parts, the first, entitled \"A Chthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World\" contained papers from scholars such as Peter Beyer, Steven Sutcliffe and Wouter J. Hanegraaff and dealt with the relationship between contemporary Paganism and various features of contemporary society, such as globalisation and the secularisation of the natural world. The second part, entitled \"The Pagan Alternative: the Goddess and Nature\", contained papers by Prudence Jones, Ronald Hutton, Susan Greenwood, Elizabeth Puttick and Geoffrey Samuel dealing with the role of goddess figures in the Pagan movement. Finally, the third part of the book, entitled \"Nature Religion in Practice\", contained articles by Jone Salomonsen, Philip Shallcrass, Vivianne Crowley and Alastair McIntosh dealing with the various religious practices of Pagans."

It is set in New Guinea and concerns the eruption of a volcano, forcing a group of survivors to flee across the country. The story is based on the 1951 eruption of Mount Lamington. Cleary was motivated to write the novel because he was interested in exploring the concept of Australia as a colonial power and researched the book by visiting New Guinea with his wife. The novel was not a big seller in Australia but did well in other countries. It was optioned for the movies but a film version proved too expensive to raise finance."

  "text" : "No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden (2012) is a military memoir by Matt Bissonnette under the pen name Mark Owen, a former member of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) who participated in the mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. The book details Owen's career with DEVGRU, including several combat missions in which he participated with the unit. At least half of the book focuses on Owen's participation in the mission that killed bin Laden. Owen and his publisher's decision to release the book without first submitting it for United States Department of Defense (DoD) review generated controversy. The DoD claims that the book contains classified information, which the book's publisher denies. In late August 2012, advance publicity drove the book to the top of the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com best-seller lists, bumped up the initial print run from 300,000 copies to 575,000, and led the publisher to release the book on September 4, a week earlier than the originally planned September 11 release date. It also made the New York Times bestseller list. Shortly after the book's announcement, Owen's identity was revealed as Matt Bissonnette; the Department of Defense confirmed that he was the author. For media appearances, including an interview on 60 Minutes, Owen appeared incognito. In August 2016, he was ordered to return his royalties of US$6.8 million to the US federal government."

  "text" : "Written by Jeffrey M. Leatherwood, Nine From Aberdeen is an academic history book dedicated to the U.S. Army Ordnance Bomb Disposal service branch in World War II, which served across the globe. These elite Army Ordnance soldiers, which included some members of the Army Air Forces, were among the forerunners of today's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) branch. First published in June 2012, this 380-page book includes an afterword from retired EOD Command Sergeant Major James H. Clifford, the chief military consultant for The Hurt Locker, the Motion Picture Academy's Best Film of 2010. The product of nearly ten years, Nine from Aberdeen began in 2003 as the author's original master's thesis at Western Carolina University's Hunter Library. This expanded and revised book relies chiefly on veteran interviews and unit histories to present a cross-section of the whole World War II bomb disposal experience. Nine From Aberdeen also includes many rare photos from private and government collections, as well as charts and diagrams. The hardcover edition features a dust-jacket cover modeled on the U.S. Army Bomb Disposal School's distinctive unit insignia, approved by the Department of the U.S. Army. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Major Thomas J. Kane and eight other American soldiers traveled to wartime England in order to study methods pioneered by the Royal Engineers. At the time, the U.S. lacked any bomb disposal organization, while the British had the most advanced program at that time. Graduating from the Royal Engineer Bomb Disposal training course, the Americans were honored with honorary membership in the British service. Kane and his cadre returned in early 1942 to supervise the U.S. Army’s very first explosive ordnance disposal school at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Originally conceived to defend the American homeland from aerial attacks on both coasts, Kane's bomb disposal branch realized its fullest potential in overseas battlefronts, from the Aleutian Islands to the Italian Alps. Kane's school was directly responsible for training eight companies and over 200 squads for field service with the U.S. Army and Air Forces. Three of Kane’s original cadre members from the British training mission volunteered to lead bomb disposal squads across the Mediterranean, European, and Pacific Theaters, where they repeatedly distinguished themselves for heroism and leadership. Capt. Ronald Felton's 12th BD Squad weathered the Italian mud. Capt. Joe Pilcher’s 17th BD Squad crossed over during the Normandy campaign and liberated Paris. Capt. Richard Metress died on Mindanao in June 1945 along with three 209th BD Squad technicians while liberating the Philippines. They are memorialized at Manila American Cemetery. Promoted to colonel, Kane carried out two significant missions for the War Department and Office of Civilian Defense, and later capped off his wartime career as Director of Bomb Disposal for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in Western Europe. After the war, Col. Kane remained on active duty with the Army, supervising bomb removal operations with occupation forces in Japan, and overseeing the newly constituted U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal branch during the Korean War. Kane died in 1965 and is buried in the Arlington National Cemetery. He was inducted to the Ordnance Hall of Fame in 1969. Ultimately, the Army (and Air Force) Bomb Disposal service took part in nearly all landings and ground operations in World War II, suffering ten percent casualties in the European Theater alone. After the Axis surrender in 1945, bomb disposal technicians aided with post-war reconstruction efforts across the globe. However, Army bomb disposal's small unit increments and wartime secrecy kept them in relative obscurity for most of the duration of World War II. Matters were further complicated when some missions performed by Ordnance were credited to the Army Corps of Engineers, whose battlefield jurisdiction occasionally overlapped with that of Bomb Disposal. In 2004, the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) dedicated Kane Hall at Ft. Gillem, GA. In the wake of Fort Gillem's closure in 2006, the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD) relocated its headquarters to Ft. Campbell, KY in 2009. Dedication for a new Kane Hall took place on 29 March 2013, presided over by Col. Marue \"Mo\" Quick, the 52d EOD Group commander. Jeffrey Leatherwood, author of Nine From Aberdeen, delivered the keynote address in honor of Col. Thomas J. Kane."

It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realised. But if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\"", "\"The significance of Mandela can be considered in two related ways. First, he has provided through his personal", "That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people.\"", "\"Gracious but steely, [Mandela] steered a country in turmoil toward a negotiated settlement: a country that days before its first democratic election remained violent, riven by divisive views and personalities. He endorsed national reconciliation, an idea he did not merely foster in the abstract, but performed with panache and conviction in reaching out to former adversaries. He initiated an era of hope that, while not long-lasting, was nevertheless decisive, and he garnered the highest international recognition and affection.\"", "\"A friend once asked me how I could reconcile my creed of African nationalism with a belief in dialectical materialism. For me, there was no contradiction. I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny. But at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world. Our problems, while distinctive and special, were not unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history was valuable.

Why this particular name I have no idea.\"", "\"We of Umkhonto have always sought to achieve liberation without bloodshed and civil clash. We hope, even at this late hour, that our first actions will awaken everyone to a realization of the dangerous situation to which Nationalist policy is leading.

  "text" : "Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC and co-founding its Youth League. After the Afrikaner minority government of the National Party established apartheid—a system of racial segregation that privileged whites—he was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 anti-apartheid Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was one of the activists unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and lead a sabotage campaign against the government. In 1962, he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial. Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid international pressure and growing fear of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. While retaining the former government's economic liberalism, his administration introduced measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on charitable work, combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. He received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Soviet Lenin Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, or as Tata (\"Father\"), and described as the \"Father of the Nation\"."

  "text" : "Neurosis and Human Growth: The Struggle Toward Self-Realization is the magnum opus of German-American psychoanalyst Karen Horney. In it she outlines her theory of neurosis. In Horney's view, the key difference between neurosis and healthy growth is the difference between compulsive actions fueled by anxiety and spontaneous actions fueled by one's full range of emotions. If a person grows up able to maintain his or her spontaneity, that person grows up by a process which Horney calls self-realization. Horney describes self-realization as the development of a person's given potentialities, and compares it with the process of an acorn growing, given fertile soil, into a tree. The principal subject of the book, however, is what happens when a person's spontaneity is crushed in early life. The person will slowly lose touch with that spontaneity or real self, and develop, instead, a reactive self which is constructed to respond to dangers of various kinds. If a child's early environment is such that the child grows up seeing the world as basically hostile, compulsive actions will predominate and the child will grow up devoted to allaying anxiety. This development and its consequences for the adult personality are what Horney calls neurosis. Horney devotes thirteen chapters to an analysis of the neurotic development in all its nuances and the various forms it can take as a person grows into adulthood, one chapter to the process of overcoming neurosis in therapy, and one chapter to how her theory compares and contrasts with classical psychoanalytic theory."

  "text" : "National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy is the memoir of Hassan Rouhani, the first secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council who was also in charge of Iran’s nuclear case under President Mohammad Khatami as tensions began to escalate over Iran's nuclear program. About two years after this book was first published in 2011, its author was elected as President of Iran on 15 June 2013. In this book, he has focused on Iran’s nuclear program and challenges created by the Western countries, especially the United States and three European countries of France, Germany and United Kingdom, during 678 days (from October 6, 2003 to August 15, 2005) when he and his team were handling Iran’s nuclear case. The history of Iran’s nuclear technology and the process of achieving complete nuclear fuel cycle are major topics of the book. This is the first book written by a high-ranking Iranian official who was once leading Iran’s nuclear negotiating team. Other memoirs have been also published on Iran’s nuclear case including by Mohamed ElBaradei (former Director-General of IAEA), Joschka Fischer (former German foreign minister), Jack Straw (former British foreign secretary), and Hossein Mousavian (a former member of Iran’s nuclear negotiating team)."

  "text" : "Naalukettu is a Malayalam novel written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair. Published in 1958, it was MT's first major novel. The title attributes to Nālukettu, a traditional ancestral home (Taravad) of a Nair joint family. Like many other novels written by MT, Naalukettu is also set against the backdrop of the crumbling matrilineal order of Kerala in a newly independent India. Naalukettu remains a classic in Malayalam fiction. It contributed to the renewal of a literary tradition initiated by S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai and Uroob in the 1950s. It was given the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1959. It has had 23 reprints (as of 2008) and was translated into 14 languages and had a record sale of a half a million copies (as of 2008) and still features in the best-seller lists. Doordarshan adapted the novel into a television film in 1995. Malayalam actor Krishnaprasad enacted the protagonist in this film. It won the Kerala State Television Award for the year 1996. A screenplay based on the novel was released on 8 December 2012 as part of the DC International Book Festival, Thiruvananthapuram."

  "text" : "Njanji Soenji (Republican Spelling: Njanji Sunji; Perfected Spelling: Nyanyi Sunyi; Indonesian for \"Songs of Solitude\" or \"Songs of Silence\") is a 1937 poetry collection by Amir Hamzah. Written some time after the poet was forced to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat instead of his chosen love in Java, this collection consists of 24 titled poems and pieces of lyrical prose, none of which are dated. First published in the magazine Poedjangga Baroe, the collection has been republished as a stand-alone book several times. Analysis of Nyanyi Sunyi has focused on the theme of God and His relationship to humanity, as well as of aspects of human existence: fate, dissatisfaction, and escape. Literary critics H.B. Jassin and Zuber Usman view the collection as an attempt to address Amir’s worldly problems. The collection has been noted as difficult to read owing to its usage of rarely used Malay and Javanese terms and basis in Islamic culture and Malay history. Despite this, Nyanyi Sunyi has been described as freer in its form than traditional Malay poetry, with what poet Chairil Anwar termed \"compactly violent, sharp, and yet short\" sentences which brought a new style to the Indonesian language."

The novel is the third in the Wolves Chronicles, a series of books set in a fictional 19th century in which the Stuart kings had not been ousted by William of Orange; a key plot driver (from Black Hearts in Battersea) is the efforts of \"Hanoverians\" to overthrow \"King James III\" and his heirs. Nightbirds on Nantucket is the second novel to feature Dido Twite and the first in which she is the main character."

  "text" : "Not in Front of the Children: \"Indecency,\" Censorship, and the Innocence of Youth is a non-fiction book by attorney and civil libertarian Marjorie Heins about freedom of speech and the relationship between censorship and the \"think of the children\" argument. The book presents a chronological history of censorship from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and the Middle Ages to the present. It discusses notable censored works, including Ulysses by James Joyce, Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence and the seven dirty words monologue by comedian George Carlin. Heins discusses censorship aimed at youth in the United States through legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act and the Communications Decency Act. The author explores the question of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them. Not in Front of the Children received the Eli M. Oboler Award in 2002 from the American Library Association as the \"Best Published Work on Intellectual Freedom\". Booklist recommended it as a starting point for discussion between adolescents and adults. Library Journal recommended the book for academic and public libraries as a detailed history of censorship related to obscenity. Publishers Weekly called the book a significant work in the fields of child psychology and civil liberties. In Florida, the St. Petersburg Times praised the book as an engaging look at attempts to prevent adolescents from thinking about sexuality. The American Prospect criticized Heins' presentation style, calling the book boring."

  "text" : "No Matter How Much You Promise to Cook or Pay the Rent You Blew It Cauze Bill Bailey Ain't Never Coming Home Again is a 2003 novel by Edgardo Vega Yunqué. The author has called it a \"jazz novel.\" Bill Bailey is set in New York City in the 1980s, and tells the saga of Billy Farrell and his daughter Vidamía. Billy is a lackluster Irish-American who gave up music after losing two fingers, and some of his sanity, in Vietnam. Billy and Vidamía first meet when she is 12 years old. Her mother is a social-climbing, assimilation-minded Puerto Rican who has married a wealthy CPA and is raising Vidamía in the suburbs. But Vidamía finds herself strongly attracted to her father, her father's family, and the Lower East Side. The novel's title is a play on the title and lyrics of the jazz classic, \"Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?\". The song and the relevant lyrics are explicitly mentioned in the novel."

  "text" : "Nirmala (Hindi: निर्मला (virtuous or pure) or The Second Wife ) is a Hindi fiction novel written in Hindi and Urdu writer Munshi Premchand. The melodramatic novel is centered on Nirmala, a young girl who was forced to marry a widower of her father's age. The plot unfolds to reveal her husband’s suspicion of a relationship between her and his eldest son, a suspicion that leads to the son’s death. A poignant novel first published in 1927, Nirmala's reformist agenda is transparent in its theme which deals with the question of dowry, and consequently mismatched marriages and related issues. The story uses fiction to highlight an era of much needed social reform in 1920s Indian society. Nirmala was serialized in 1928 in Chand, a women’s magazine in which the novel’s feminist character was represented. Nirmala is somewhat like Godaan (published in 1936) in that it deals with the exploitation of the village poor, and was translated by multiple scholarly translators. It was first translated in 1988 as The Second Wife by David Rubin, and in 1999 as Nirmala by Alok Rai, Premchand's grandson."

  "text" : "Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity is an 1802 work of Christian apologetics and philosophy of religion by the English clergyman William Paley (July 1743 – 25 May 1805). The book expounds his arguments from natural theology, making a teleological argument for the existence of God, notably beginning with the watchmaker analogy. The book was written in the context of the natural theology tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence and goodness of God from the general well-being of living things and the physical world. Paley's Natural Theology is an extended argument, constructed around a series of examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; and the existence of finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than the sum of its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial. The book was many times republished and remains in print. It continues to be consulted by creationists. Charles Darwin took its arguments seriously and responded to them; evolutionary biologists like Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins continue to discuss Paley's book to respond to modern proponents with similar ideas."

  "text" : "Naples '44 is a military memoir of World War II written by the British travel writer and novelist Norman Lewis that was first published in 1978. It is in the form of a diary that was kept by Lewis while he was a sergeant in the Field Security Service of the British Army Intelligence Corps in southern Italy from September 1943 to October 1944. The military historian Sir John Keegan described it, together with George MacDonald Fraser’s Quartered Safe Out Here, as \"one of the great personal memoirs of the Second World War\". The book is especially notable for its depictions of the wartime suffering endured by the civilian population of the city of Naples. Lewis’s account of a group of blind girl orphans being refused food in a restaurant in the city has been requoted several times by other authors: The experience changed my outlook. Until now I had clung to the comforting belief that human beings eventually come to terms with pain and sorrow. Now I understood I was wrong, and like Paul I suffered a conversion – but to pessimism. These little girls, any one of whom could be my daughter, came into the restaurant weeping, and they were weeping when they were led away. I knew that, condemned to everlasting darkness, hunger and loss, they would weep on incessantly. They would never recover from their pain, and I would never recover from the memory of it. Naples '44 was first published by William Collins in 1978 and republished as a paperback by Eland Books in 1983."

  "text" : "No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an autobiography by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It was published in hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper as a form of therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma. The book recounts Dickinson's early life where she states she experienced child abuse from her father, and moves forward describing her experiences throughout her career as a model. Dickinson explains her struggle with substance dependence upon drugs and alcohol during her career. The author discusses her time as a representative for companies including Virginia Slims, Max Factor, and Hush Puppies; and her success appearing on the covers of magazines including: Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmo. While performing work as a model she takes the time to gain knowledge about the craft of photography and fashion. Dickinson describes how she originated the term \"supermodel\". No Lifeguard on Duty cautions about the tendency towards insecurity in celebrity culture. No Lifeguard on Duty received a favorable reception from multiple publications. Film rights to the book were purchased by Warner Bros. in 2004. Women's Wear Daily praised the author's comedic style in the work. Knight Ridder Newspapers wrote positively of the author's courage at describing difficult experiences from her past. The New York Observer found the writing style of the book to have a good flow throughout. Publishers Weekly wrote: \"Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor.\" Dickinson's book had a positive impact on her career. Because of reading the book, Tyra Banks decided to bring Dickinson on board as a judge on her new program America's Next Top Model in 2003. Dickinson served as a judge on the program for a total of four seasons before being replaced by Twiggy Lawson. Oxygen Network subsequently hired her for its new program centered on the author's efforts to start her own company; the program launched in 2006 titled: The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency."
