  "text" : "Gaudy Night (1935) is a mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, the tenth in her popular series about aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, and the third featuring crime writer Harriet Vane. The dons of Harriet Vane's alma mater, the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (a thinly veiled take on Sayers' own Somerville College), have invited her back to attend the annual 'Gaudy' celebrations. However, the mood turns sour when someone begins a series of malicious pranks including poison-pen messages, obscene graffiti, the destruction of a set of proofs and crafting vile effigies. Desperate to avoid a possible murder in college, Harriet eventually asks her old friend Wimsey to investigate."

  "text" : "Good-Bye to All That, an autobiography by Robert Graves, first appeared in 1929, when the author was 34 years old. \"It was my bitter leave-taking of England,\" he wrote in a prologue to the revised second edition of 1957, \"where I had recently broken a good many conventions\". The title may also point to the passing of an old order following the cataclysm of the First World War; the inadequacies of patriotism, the rise of atheism, feminism, socialism and pacifism, the changes to traditional married life, and not least the emergence of new styles of literary expression, are all treated in the work, bearing as they did directly on Graves' life. The unsentimental and frequently comic treatment of the banalities and intensities of the life of a British army officer in the First World War gave Graves fame, notoriety and financial security, but the book's subject is also his family history, childhood, schooling and, immediately following the war, early married life; all phases bearing witness to the \"particular mode of living and thinking\" that constitute a poetic sensibility. Laura Riding, Graves' lover, is credited with being a \"spiritual and intellectual midwife\" to the work."

  "text" : "Gigi (pronounced: [ʒi.ʒi]) is a 1944 novella by French writer Colette. The plot focuses on a young Parisian girl being groomed for a career as a courtesan and her relationship with the wealthy cultured man named Gaston who falls in love with her and eventually marries her. The novella was the basis for a 1949 French film starring Danièle Delorme and Gaby Morlay. In 1951, it was adapted for the stage by Anita Loos. Colette had personally picked the yet unknown Audrey Hepburn on first sight to play the title role. Her Aunt Alicia was played by stage legend Cathleen Nesbitt, who was to become Hepburn's acting mentor from that time on. Opening on 24 November 1951 on Broadway at the Fulton Theatre, the play ran for 219 performances (finishing on 31 May 1952) and Hepburn's debut on Broadway earned her a Theatre World Award. The novella was translated into English by Roger Senhouse and published (with \"The Cat\" translated by Antonia White) in 1953. Seven years later, a musical film version with a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and a score by Lerner and Frederick Loewe won the Academy Award for Best Picture. This film version starred Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan. The story of a girl being groomed to be a courtesan by her grandmother made producer Arthur Freed doubt whether making it as a straight drama would be acceptable to the American censors, so they \"cleaned it up\" and turned it into a musical. Lerner and Loewe adapted the film for a 1973 stage musical that proved to be unsuccessful. A pre-Broadway production of the musical, newly adapted by Heidi Thomas (Call the Midwife, Cranford, Upstairs Downstairs) and directed by Eric D. Schaeffer (Follies, Million Dollar Quartet) was performed at Washington D.C's Kennedy Center till mid February 2015 with High School Musical actress Vanessa Anne Hudgens playing as Gigi.This revival of Gigi opened on Broadway, at the Neil Simon Theater, on April 8, 2015."

  "text" : "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (also titled Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years) is a 1997 transdisciplinary non-fiction book by Jared Diamond, professor of geography and physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1998, Guns, Germs, and Steel won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. A documentary based on the book, and produced by the National Geographic Society, was broadcast on PBS in July 2005. The book attempts to explain why Eurasian civilizations (including North Africa) have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian hegemony is due to any form of Eurasian intellectual, moral, or inherent genetic superiority. Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various positive feedback loops. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes."

  "text" : "Great Expectations is the thirteenth novel by Charles Dickens and his penultimate completed novel; a bildungsroman which depicts the personal growth and personal development of an orphan nicknamed Pip. It is Dickens's second novel, after David Copperfield, to be fully narrated in the first person. The novel was first published as a serial in Dickens's weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes. The novel is set in Kent and London in the early to mid-19th century and contains some of Dickens' most memorable scenes, including the opening in a graveyard, where the young Pip is accosted by the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Great Expectations is full of extreme imagery – poverty; prison ships and chains, and fights to the death – and has a colourful cast of characters who have entered popular culture. These include the eccentric Miss Havisham, the beautiful but cold Estella, and Joe, the unsophisticated and kind blacksmith. Dickens's themes include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. Great Expectations (popular both with readers and literary critics) has been translated into many languages and adapted numerous times into various media. Upon its release, the novel received near universal acclaim, although Thomas Carlyle spoke disparagingly of \"all that Pip's nonsense.\" Later, George Bernard Shaw praised the novel, as \"All of one piece and consistently truthfull.\" During the serial publication, Dickens was pleased with public response to Great Expectations and its sales; when the plot first formed in his mind, he called it \"a very fine, new and grotesque idea.\""

  "text" : "Goldfinger is the seventh novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. Goldfinger originally bore the title The Richest Man in the World and was written in January and February 1958. The story centres on the investigation by MI6 operative James Bond into the gold smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot, with Goldfinger planning to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox. Fleming developed the James Bond character more in Goldfinger than in the previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George. The Saint George theme is echoed by the fact that it is a British agent sorting out an American problem. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names of people he knew, or knew of, throughout his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger. Upon learning of the use of his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name, before the matter was settled out of court. Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book, and the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson. Upon its release, Goldfinger went to the top of the best-seller lists; the novel was broadly well received by the critics, being favourably compared to contemporary version of both Sapper and John Buchan. Goldfinger was serialised as a daily story and as a comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper, before being the third James Bond feature film of the Eon Productions series, released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond. Most recently, Goldfinger was adapted for BBC Radio with Toby Stephens as Bond and Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger."

  "text" : "Goodbye, Columbus is a 1959 collection of fiction by the American novelist Philip Roth, comprising the title novella \"Goodbye, Columbus\"—which first appeared in The Paris Review—and five short stories. It was his first book and was published by Houghton Mifflin. In addition to the title novella, set in New Jersey, Goodbye, Columbus contains the five short stories \"The Conversion of the Jews,\" \"Defender of the Faith,\" \"Epstein,\" \"You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings,\" and \"Eli, the Fanatic.\" Each story deals with the concerns of second and third-generation assimilated American Jews as they leave the ethnic ghettos of their parents and grandparents and go on to college, to white-collar professions, and to life in the suburbs. The book was a critical success for Roth and won the 1960 U.S. National Book Award for FictionThat earned his name as an up-and-coming young writer. The book was not without controversy, as people within the Jewish community took issue with Roth's less than flattering portrayal of some characters. The short story Defender of the Faith, about a Jewish sergeant who is exploited by three shirking, coreligionist draftees, drew particular ire. When Roth in 1962 appeared on a panel alongside the distinguished black novelist Ralph Ellison to discuss minority representation in literature, the questions directed at him became denunciations. Many accused Roth of being a self-hating Jew, a label that stuck with him for years. It is often speculated that the obscene comedy of Portnoy's Complaint (1969) was Roth's defiant reply to early Jewish critics. The title novella was made into the 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus, starring Ali MacGraw and Richard Benjamin."

  "text" : "Go Ask Alice is a 1971 fictionalized autobiography detailing the life of a troubled teenage girl. It is written by Anonymous in the form of the diary of an anonymous teenage girl who becomes addicted to drugs. The diarist's name is never given in the book. The novel's title was taken from a line in the 1967 Grace Slick-penned Jefferson Airplane song \"White Rabbit\" (\"go ask Alice/when she's ten feet tall\"), which is itself a reference to a scene in Lewis Carroll's book Alice's Adventures In Wonderland where Alice eats one side of a mushroom that makes her grow large. Go Ask Alice is presented as an anti-drug testimonial. Claimed to be taken from an actual diary, the story caused a sensation when published, and remains in print. Revelations about the book's origin cast doubt on its authenticity and factual accounts, and the publishers have listed it as a work of fiction since at least the mid-late 1980s. Although it is still published under the byline \"Anonymous\", it is largely or wholly the work of its purported editor, Beatrice Sparks. Some of the days and dates referenced in the book put the timeline from 1968 until 1970. It became a TV movie in 1973 with Jamie Smith-Jackson, William Shatner, Ruth Roman, Andy Griffith, Wendell Burton, and Julie Adams."

  "text" : "Glue is a 2001 novel by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh. Glue tells the stories of four Scottish boys over four decades, through the use of different perspectives and different voices. It addresses sex, drugs, violence, and other social issues in Scotland, mapping “the furious energies of working-class masculinity in the late 20th century, using a compulsive mixture of Lothians dialect, libertarian socialist theory, and an irresistible black humour.” The title refers not to solvent abuse, but the metaphorical glue holding the four friends together through changing times. The four main characters are Terry Lawson (Juice Terry), Billy Birrell (Business Birrell), Andrew Galloway (Gally), Carl Ewart (DJ N-Sign). We first meet them as small children in 1970, then as teenagers around 1980, as young men around 1990 (on holiday in Munich), and as men in their late thirties around 2000 (during the Edinburgh Festival). The novel is split into five different sections."

  "text" : "Glimpses of World History, a book published by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1934, is a panoramic sweep of the history of humankind. It is a collection of 196 letters on world history written from various prisons in British India between 1930–1933. The letters were written to his young daughter Indira, and were meant to introduce her to world history. The letters start off with one he sends to his daughter on her birthday. He says he is sad about not being able to send her any \"material\" gift from prison, so he would try to give her something he can \"afford\", a series of letters from his heart. Written from prison, where he had no recourse to reference books or a library but his personal notes, Glimpses of World History contains the history of humankind from 6000 BC to the time of writing of the book. It covers the rise and fall of great empires and civilizations from Greece and Rome to China and West Asia; great figures such as Ashoka and Genghis Khan, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Vladimir Lenin; wars and revolutions, democracies and dictatorships. He wrote about many cultures throughout the globe in detail because, as he himself said, he didn't like the way history was taught in schools where it was confined to the history of a single country and that too narrow, and he wanted his daughter Priyadarshini to know why people did what they did. It was possible only through knowing the history of the whole world. The letters are written in informal language, with the contemporary and personal events too mentioned. They reflect the world view of Nehru, and his grasp of history. It could be considered as one of the first attempts at historiography from a non-Eurocentric angle - a statement that is itself subject to the charge of Eurocentrism, given the long history of historical writing outside of Europe, for instance in China (from The Classic of History, c. 550 BC) or the Islamic world (from Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari in the 9th century AD to Biruni and Ibn Khaldun). Nehru stated in his preface that The Outline of History by H. G. Wells was a major influence on the work. The New York Times described it as: \"... one of the most remarkable books ever written.... Nehru makes even H.G. Wells seem singularly insular..... One is awed by the breadth of Nehru's culture.\" In particular, his chapter on Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion runs counter to dominant European views of the time. Prefacing his introduction to the Mongol empire, which was larger than the British empire and lasted as long, he said: \"It would be foolish not to recognize the greatness of Europe. But it would be equally foolish to forget the greatness of Asia.\" And he goes on to state: \"Genghis is, without doubt, the greatest military genius and leader in history.... Alexander and Caesar seem petty before him.\" According to Jack Weatherford, this was possibly the first re-evaluation of the Mongol empire since the 18th century. Nehru's interpretation of the Sepoy Mutiny—sparked by the order for the Sepoys to bite off the paper cartridges for their rifles which were greased with animal fat, namely beef and pork—is that \"the Revolt of 1857-58 was the last flicker of feudal India.\""

  "text" : "God & Golem, Inc.: A Comment on Certain Points Where Cybernetics Impinges on Religion is a book written by MIT cybernetician Norbert Wiener. It won the second annual U.S. National Book Award in category Science, Philosophy and Religion. It is based on material from a series of lectures that Wiener gave at Yale in 1962, and a seminar he led at the Colloques Philosophiques Internationaux de Royaumont near Paris later that year. God and Golem presents Wiener's ideas on machine learning, machine reproduction, and the place of machines in society, with some religious context. The provocative title sums up the confrontation of technical, mathematical and imaginative boldness with cultural prejudice. Wiener mentions some of his secondary concerns: sensory feedback in artificial limbs, the problems of human responsibility in relation with technology, the limits of machine game-playing, Darwinism, Marxism, the Cold War, the rigidity of ideological thinking, and a critique of the claims of econometrics and mathematical economics to be regarded as being scientific. In the conclusion, he brings the burden of ethics to politics, away from religion. Statements in the book are quoted in the science-fiction novels Hyperion (Simmons novel) and The Fall of Hyperion (novel) , written by Dan Simmons."

  "text" : "Gravity's Rainbow is a 1973 novel by American writer Thomas Pynchon. Lengthy, complex, and featuring a large cast of characters, the narrative is set primarily in Europe at the end of World War II, and centers on the design, production and dispatch of V-2 rockets by the German military. In particular, it features the quest undertaken by several characters to uncover the secret of a mysterious device named the \"Schwarzgerät\" (\"black device\"), slated to be installed in a rocket with the serial number \"00000\". Traversing a wide range of knowledge, the novel transgresses boundaries between high and low culture, between literary propriety and profanity, and between science and speculative metaphysics. The novel shared the 1974 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction with A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer. Although selected by the Pulitzer Prize jury on fiction for the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, a single passage involving coprophilia offended the Pulitzer Advisory Board, which rejected the selection. No Pulitzer Prize was awarded for fiction that year. The novel was nominated for the 1973 Nebula Award for Best Novel. TIME named the novel one of its \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\", a list of the best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005 and it is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest American novels ever written."

Though self-published and little-noticed in its time, the book is a favourite of fans of constrained writing and is a sought-after rarity among some book collectors. Later editions of the book have sometimes carried the alternative subtitle 50,000 Word Novel Without the Letter \"E\". In 1968, the novel entered the public domain in the United States due to failure to renew copyright in the 28th year after publication."

  "text" : "Girlfriend in a Coma is a novel by Canadian writer and artist Douglas Coupland. It was first published by HarperCollins Canada in 1998. The novel tells the story of a group of friends growing up in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in the late 1970s. On the night of a teenage house-wrecking party, one of the protagonists, Karen, falls into a coma. More alarmingly, she seemed to expect it, having given her boyfriend, Richard, a letter detailing the vivid dreams of the future she had experienced and how she wanted to sleep for a thousand years to avoid that dystopia. The book was named after the 1987 single \"Girlfriend in a Coma\" by The Smiths. Additionally, Coupland uses other Smiths lyrics and song titles within the book such as \"Bigmouth Strikes Again,\" \"Hand in Glove,\" and \"The Queen Is Dead.\""

  "text" : "Growth Fetish is a book about economics and politics by the Australian liberal political theorist Clive Hamilton. Published in 2003 it became a best-seller in Australia, an unusual feat for what is normally considered a dry subject. The book argues that the policies of unfettered capitalism pursued by the west for the last 50 years has largely failed, since the underlying purpose of the creation of wealth is happiness, and Hamilton claims that people in general are no happier now than 50 years ago, despite the huge increase in personal wealth. Hamilton goes on to claim that the pursuit of growth has become a fetish, pursued at a tremendous cost in terms of the environment, erosion of democracy, and the values of society as a whole."

  "text" : "Germinal is the thirteenth novel in Émile Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel – an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s – has been published and translated in over one hundred countries and has additionally inspired five film adaptations and two television productions. Germinal was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical Gil Blas, then in March 1885 published as a book. The title (pronounced: [ʒɛʁminal]) refers to the name of a month of the French Republican Calendar, a spring month. Germen is a Latin word which means \"seed\"; the novel describes the hope for a better future that seeds amongst the miners. As the final lines of the novel read: Des hommes poussaient, une armée noire, vengeresse, qui germait lentement dans les sillons, grandissant pour les récoltes du siècle futur, et dont la germination allait faire bientôt éclater la terre.Men were springing forth, a black avenging army, germinating slowly in the furrows, growing towards the harvests of the next century, and their germination would soon overturn the earth.— 1885 translation"

  "text" : "Godric (ISBN 0-06-061162-6) is a novel published in 1981, written by Frederick Buechner, that tells the semi-fictionalised life story of medieval Catholic saint Godric of Finchale. The novel was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Godric is told in Saint Godric's own voice: Buechner intentionally uses style, tone, and word choice to evoke a \"mediaeval\" manner of speaking. The book unfolds with Godric narrating the events of his life in retrospect, as he looks back on his hundred years of life and does not see the saintly existence that many ascribe to him. The honest earthiness of Godric's account of his life—his candour in describing his most pious acts and most wretched sins—made this book a critical favourite. The Times, for example, noted in its Literary Supplement that \"Godric is a living battleground where God fights it out with the world, the Flesh, and the Devil.\" As a historical novel it provides a gateway for understanding mediaeval history with the full breadth of imagination, characterisation and emotion in which non-fiction history is restricted. Some of the historical themes Buechner masterfully envisions in the book include blood libels, pilgrimage, Christian asceticism, hagiography, traveling court culture, Norman and Saxon relations."

  "text" : "Geek Love is a novel by Katherine Dunn, published completely by Alfred A. Knopf (a division of Random House) in 1989. Dunn published parts of the novel in Mississippi Mud Book of Days (1983) and Looking Glass Bookstore Review (1988). It was a finalist for the National Book Award. The novel is the story of a traveling carnival run by Aloysius \"Al\" Binewski and his wife \"Crystal\" Lil, and their children, seen through the eyes of their daughter Olympia (\"Oly\") who writes the family history for her daughter Miranda. When the business begins to fail, the couple devise an idea to breed their own freak show, using various drugs and radioactive material to alter the genes of their children. The results are Arturo (\"Arty\"), a boy with flippers for hands and feet; Electra (\"Elly\") and Iphigenia (\"Iphy\"), Siamese Twins; Olympia (\"Oly\"), a hunchbacked albino dwarf; and Fortunato (\"Chick\"), the normal-looking baby of the family who has telekinetic powers."

  "text" : "Goodbye, Mickey Mouse is a historical novel by Len Deighton published on October 12, 1982. Set in Britain in early 1944 it tells the story of the 220th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force in the lead up to the Allied invasion of Europe. The Group is based at the fictional Steeple Thaxted airfield in Norfolk. The novel successfully evokes wartime Britain with the effects of rationing and the simmering antipathy the British servicemen felt towards their well-paid American allies. It also features Deighton's trademark technical and operational details of the P-51 Mustang fighter which the Group flies. The aerial scenes are few and brief but powerfully capture the terror and excitement of bomber escort missions over Germany."

  "text" : "Globalization and Its Discontents is a book published in 2002 by the 2001 Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz. The book draws on Stiglitz's personal experience as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Bill Clinton from 1993 and chief economist at the World Bank from 1997. During this period Stiglitz became disillusioned with the IMF and other international institutions, which he came to believe acted against the interests of impoverished developing countries. Stiglitz argues that the policies pursued by the IMF are based on neoliberal assumptions that are fundamentally unsound: Behind the free market ideology there is a model, often attributed to Adam Smith, which argues that market forces—the profit motive—drive the economy to efficient outcomes as if by an invisible hand. One of the great achievements of modern economics is to show the sense in which, and the conditions under which, Smith's conclusion is correct. It turns out that these conditions are highly restrictive. Indeed, more recent advances in economic theory—ironically occurring precisely during the period of the most relentless pursuit of the Washington Consensus policies—have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly. Significantly, there are desirable government interventions which, in principle, can improve upon the efficiency of the market. These restrictions on the conditions under which markets result in efficiency are important—many of the key activities of government can be understood as responses to the resulting market failures. Stiglitz argues that IMF policies contributed to bringing about the East Asian financial crisis, as well as the Argentine economic crisis. Also noted was the failure of Russia's conversion to a market economy and low levels of development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specific policies criticised by Stiglitz include fiscal austerity, high interest rates, trade liberalization, and the liberalization of capital markets and insistence on the privatization of state assets."

  "text" : "Going Postal is Terry Pratchett's 33rd Discworld novel, released in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2004. Unlike most of Pratchett's Discworld novels, Going Postal is divided into chapters, a feature previously seen only in Pratchett's children's books and the Science of Discworld series. These chapters begin with a synopsis of philosophical themes, in a similar manner to some Victorian novels and, notably, to Jules Verne stories. The title refers to both the contents of the novel, as well as to the term 'going postal'. The book was on the shortlist for both the Nebula and Locus Awards for Best (Fantasy) Novel. It would also have been shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, except that Pratchett withdrew it, as he felt stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of the Worldcon. This was the first time Pratchett had been shortlisted for either award."

The book was a surprise bestseller for the previously obscure Barth, and in the 1960s had a cult status. It marks Barth's leap into American postmodern Fabulism."

  "text" : "Gossip Girl is an American young adult novel series written by Cecily von Ziegesar and published by Little, Brown and Company, a subsidiary of the Hachette Group. The series revolves around the lives and romances of the privileged teenagers at the Constance Billard School for Girls, an elite private school in New York City's Upper East Side. The books primarily focus on best friends Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, whose experiences are among those chronicled by the eponymous gossip blogger. The novel series is based on von Ziegesar's experiences at Nightingale-Bamford School and on what she heard from friends. The first novel, Gossip Girl, was released in April 2002; the eleventh novel of the series was released in May 2007, with a prequel novel following in October 2007. Another follow-up novel, in which the characters return home from college for the holidays, was released in hardback format in November 2009. The original novel became the inspiration for the Gossip Girl teen drama television series, created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, which premiered on The CW Television Network on September 19, 2007. There are now 13 novels. In May 2008, a follow-up series, Gossip Girl: The Carlyles, began publication, following the Carlyle triplets as they begin moving to the Upper East Side. As of October 2009, four novels have been released in this series. Ziegesar created a spin-off series, The It Girl, which began publication in 2005, and Yen Press has adapted the series into a manga series titled Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only."

Since 1988, Jeff Shaara has written The Last Full Measure, which follows the events presented in The Killer Angels. In 2003 Gods and Generals was made into a film directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and starring Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels. The film shares most of its cast with Gettysburg, the film adaptation of The Killer Angels."

  "text" : "Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture is a 2002 text by Susan Hopkins. It is a cultural analysis of the contemporary archetype of the girl hero in popular culture. Hopkins argues for a link between the 1990s British band Spice Girls, their vision of girl power, and the creation of a new kind of \"girl hero.\" Hopkins also explores the roles of figures such as supermodels, magical girls, Carmen Sandiego, Britney Spears, Lara Croft, Xena, Dana Scully the Charlie's Angels (2000s), Sabrina Spellman, Mulan, and Buffy Summers. She also draws comparisons between these images and earlier ones, such as Emma Peel of The Avengers, the 1970s television show Wonder Woman, Madonna and the Charlie's Angels of the 1970s, pointing out the relative independence of this archetype from male and parental support."

The GTD method rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items. This allows one to focus attention on taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them. First published in 2001, a revised edition of the book was released in 2015 to reflect the changes in information technology during the preceding decade and incorporate recent scientific research supporting the system's claims regarding how the mind functions."

  "text" : "Genetics and the Origin of Species is a 1937 book by the Ukrainian-American evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. It is regarded as one of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The book popularized the work of population genetics to other biologists, and influenced their appreciation for the genetic basis of evolution. In his book, Dobzhansky applied the theoretical work of Sewall Wright (1889-1988) to the study of natural populations, allowing him to address evolutionary problems in a novel way during his time. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. The study of evolution was present, but greatly neglected at the time. Dobzhansky illustrates that evolution regarding the origin and nature of species during this time in history was deemed mysterious, but had expanding potential for progress to be made in its field."

  "text" : "George's Marvellous Medicine (known as George's Marvelous Medicine in the US) is a book written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. First published in 1981, the book was praised for its imitativeness and humour, but was also criticised for its underdeveloped plot and somewhat abrupt ending. The book is one of Dahl's shorter children's books. Being a medical expert was one of what Dahl called his “dreams of glory”: he had huge respect for doctors and particularly those who pioneered new treatments. Dahl dedicated George's Marvellous Medicine to “doctors everywhere”. An audio reading of the book was released with the actor Richard E. Grant narrating."

  "text" : "Ghost Dance is John Norman's 1970 historical fiction novel wherein a Sioux man and his tradition comes in conflict with a white woman and her civilization as the Wounded Knee Massacre approaches. As with the his Gor series, his main body of work, Norman displays both philosophical reaction and an affinity with incorporating historical events with the actions of fictional characters. Ghost Danceby John Norman \"There was little noticeable, little remarkable about Edward Chance, saving perhaps that he had once shot and killed a man....His craft, medicine, was more than a business with him, more than a professional skill. It was a way of healing his own heart too.\" In GHOST DANCE, it is through Chance's keen eyes and weary heart that readers travel along on a journey of discovery and sorrow. On the run across the plains, Chance stumbles upon Running Horse, a Sioux warrior enacting the sacred and violent ritual of the Sun Dance. Quickly, Chance is pulled into the world of the Sioux people. As their civilization teeters on the brink of destruction, the Sioux perform the mournful and frightening Ghost Dance. Clashes with the white man are rising; the Wounded Knee Massacre approaches, still in the unknown distance; and violence and anger threaten the traditions of a proud and once-great people. Nearby, in her quaint sod house, Miss Lucia Turner awaits the full impact of those clashes. Dust on the horizon signals great change coming to her once-simple life. Lucia will soon become a different kind of woman.With GHOST DANCE author John Norman brings the same vigor and passion of storytelling and imagination that enriches his classic Gor novels to a vivid story of historical upheaval and personal exploration.(less)Published (first published January 1, 1970)"

  "text" : "Ghostwritten is the first novel published by the author David Mitchell. Published in 1999, it won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and was widely acclaimed. The story takes place mainly around East Asia, but also moves through Russia, Britain, the USA and Ireland. It is written episodically; each chapter details a different story and central character, although they are all interlinked through seemingly coincidental events. Many of the themes from Ghostwritten continue in Mitchell’s subsequent novels, number9dream and Cloud Atlas, and a character later appears in The Bone Clocks. Ghostwritten is the subject of a number of influences, particularly from East Asian culture and superstition, as well as real events remodeled for plot purposes (e.g. the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway). There are also hints and references to other works, most prominently from Isaac Asimov and the Three Laws of Robotics towards the end of the book, as well as Wild Swans by Jung Chang and The Music of Chance by Paul Auster."

  "text" : "The Massachusetts General Laws is a codification of many of the statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Commonwealth's laws are promulgated by an elected bicameral (\"two-chamber\") legislative body, the Massachusetts General Court. The resulting laws—both Session Laws and General Laws—together make up the statutory law of the Commonwealth. Each bill that becomes law is given a chapter number, assigned sequentially in the chronological order of its adoption – these are the Session Laws. The official publication of Session Laws for any given year is called the Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts, and is compiled and published annually by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The vast majority of Session Laws are Acts. A Resolve is most typically used to establish a special commission to investigate a certain issue. General Laws are Session Laws (or sections of Session Laws) that are permanent in nature and of general application. They are codified according to subject matter into a multi-volume publication entitled the General Laws of Massachusetts. The General Court amends the General Laws by enacting Session Laws which may effect modifications and additions to the General Laws. Not all Session Laws, which apply equally to codified law, are entered into the General Laws. Session Laws that are not codified into the General Laws are called Special Acts, and might include matters affecting an individual or a particular city or town. In legal citations, Massachusetts General Laws are abbreviated as M.G.L. or G.L. Provisions in the General Laws are identified by chapter and section, e.g., Mass. Gen. L. c. 93A, § 9. Chapters are grouped topically by part and title. The parts of the General Laws are as follows: The unannotated official version of the General Laws is published every two years. Two widely used annotated collections are Massachusetts General Laws Annotated (M.G.L.A.) from West Publishing, and Annotated Laws of Massachusetts (A.L.M.) published by LexisNexis. Both are available as bound collections and by subscription online. The General Laws replaced the General Statutes, which are abbreviated as G.S. when cited in lists of local-option statutes accepted by cities and towns. The Massachusetts Constitution expressly grants to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court the power to review and interpret these laws."

  "text" : "God Was Born in Exile (French: Dieu est né en exil) is a novel by Romanian author Vintilă Horia, for which he was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1960, though he was never handed the prize following allegations that surfaced after his nomination that he had once been a member of the Iron Guard. The novel's narrator is Ovid, the Roman poet, and this apocryphal work is rather similar to Marguerite Yourcenar's Mémoires d'Hadrien in which Yourcenar writes the Roman emperor Hadrian's mémoires. In God Was Born in Exile, \"Ovid\" covers the last eight years of his life, when he was exiled to Tomis, an Ancient Roman colony in Scythia Minor. This novel adopts the form of a diary, divided into eight chapters (each of which corresponds to a year of exile) that reveal the steps of a progressive \"maturation,\" or a conversion of sorts. The novel's universe is linked together around a primordial axis whose two poles are Roman society and the Dacian world, respectively. This dichotomy generates a rich range of metaphors, but perhaps this novel's most important attribute is the way in which both worlds are constructed, and their importance as \"chronotopes\" in the narrative. Ovid's spiritual journey resolves itself between both symbolic universes whose antagonistic characters become interwoven during a chiasm, in order to rise up again at the end of the radically metamorphized narration."

She also learns more about the truth of her village and the terrible secrets they hold."

The novel follows the exploits of Earth Central Security agent Ian Cormac, as he attempts to discover who or what is behind the destruction of the Runcible on a remote colony. Cormac drops an investigation into Polity separatists on Cheyne III, and takes the starship Hubris to the ruined world of Samarkand to directly oversee the investigation there. Having been directly \"gridlinked\" to the Polity A.I. network for too long, Cormac has been slowly losing his humanity, and takes the opportunity of this particular mission to disconnect and solve the mystery the old-fashioned way."

  "text" : "God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of “Academic Freedom” is a 1951 book by William F. Buckley Jr., who eventually became a leading voice in the American conservative movement in the latter half of the twentieth century. Buckley wrote the book based on his undergraduate experiences at Yale University. In the book, he criticized Yale and its faculty for forcing collectivist, Keynesian, and secularist ideology on its students. He criticized individual professors by name, arguing that they tried to break down students' religious beliefs through their hostility to religion. Buckley also states in the book that Yale was denying its students any sense of individualism by making them embrace the ideas of liberalism. Buckley argues that the Yale charter leaves oversight of the university to the alumni, and argues that because most alumni of Yale believed in God, that Yale was failing to serve its \"masters\" by teaching course content in a matter inconsistent with alumni beliefs."

The book was published on October 16, 2001. \"Greatness\" is defined as financial performance several multiples better than the market average over a sustained period. Collins finds the main reason certain companies become great is they narrowly focus the company’s resources on their field of key competence. The book was a bestseller, selling four million copies and going far beyond the traditional audience of business books."

The first three editions appeared in February, April, and November 1863, respectively. A much-revised fourth edition appeared in 1873. Antiquity of Man, as it was known to contemporary readers, dealt with three scientific issues that had become prominent in the preceding decade: the age of the human race, the existence of ice ages, and Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Lyell used the book to reverse or modify his own long-held positions on all three issues. The book drew sharp criticism from two of Lyell's younger colleagues – paleontologist Hugh Falconer and archaeologist John Lubbock – who felt that Lyell had used their work too freely and acknowledged it too sparingly. It sold well, however, and (along with Lubbock's 1865 book Prehistoric Times) helped to establish the new science of prehistoric archaeology in Great Britain."

  "text" : "Gitanjali (Bengali: গীতাঞ্জলি) is a collection of poems by the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. The original Bengali collection of 157 poems was published on August 14, 1910. The English Gitanjali or Song Offerings is a collection of 103 English poems of Tagore's own English translations of his Bengali poems first published in November 1912 by the India Society of London. It contained translations of 53 poems from the original Bengali Gitanjali, as well as 50 other poems which were from his drama Achalayatan and eight other books of poetry — mainly Gitimalya (17 poems), Naivedya (15 poems) and Kheya (11 poems). The translations were often radical, leaving out or altering large chunks of the poem and in one instance fusing two separate poems (song 95, which unifies songs 89,90 of Naivedya). The translations were undertaken prior to a visit to England in 1912, where the poems were extremely well received. In 1913, Tagore became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, largely for the English Gitanjali. The English Gitanjali became very famous in the West, and was widely translated. The word gitanjali is composed from \"geet\", song, and \"anjali\", offering, and thus means – \"An offering of songs\"; but the word for offering, anjali, has a strong devotional connotation, so the title may also be interpreted as \"prayer offering of song\"."

The book's final twist reveals the old woman as a witch. Guess What? is on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000 at number 66. The challenges to the book are generated because of the supposed occult connection since the book is leading the reader to develop a positive impression of a witch."

  "text" : "Garfield is an American comic strip created by Jim Davis. Published since 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character, the cat Garfield, Jon, his owner, and Jon's dog, Odie. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and journals, and held the Guinness World Record for being the world's most widely syndicated comic strip. Though this is rarely mentioned in print, Garfield is set in Muncie, Indiana, the home of Jim Davis, according to the television special Happy Birthday, Garfield. Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon (his owner), and Odie (Jon's pet dog), but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to \"come up with a good, marketable character\", Garfield has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies. Part of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong,\" joking that, for many years, he thought \"OPEC was a denture adhesive\"."

He returned to his narrative fiction and recorded this memorable pledge in his Notebooks on 23 January 1895: \"I take up my own old pen again – the pen of all my old unforgettable efforts and sacred struggles. To myself – today – I need say no more. Large and full and high the future still opens. It is now indeed that I may do the work of my life. And I will.\""

  "text" : "Goodnight Opus (ISBN 978-0-316-10853-9) is a 1993 children's book by Berkeley Breathed featuring Opus the Penguin. Goodnight Opus is a take-off of the popular Goodnight Moon children's book; this book actually begins with Opus being read Goodnight Moon by a maternal nanny figure while he sits in bed in his pink pajamas. After the nanny falls asleep while reading, Opus goes on his own journey to say goodnight to all sorts of fanciful beings and animals. The entire journey is an ode to imagination and to going beyond the last pages of a book (\"departed the text\"). Because the book encourages readers to think radically, it has \"been banned in seventeen countries with early bedtimes\", according to Breathed's website. The book ultimately served as a foreshadowing of Opus's fate; in the character's final story-arc in the Opus comic strip, he is encouraged by the ghost of Elvis and Breathed himself to choose someplace where he can spend eternity in peace. The final strip finds that Opus has chosen to spend eternity sleeping in the bed on the final page of Goodnight Moon."

It gives a fictionalized account of his journey to Ireland in 1953-1954 to write a screen adaptation of the novel Moby-Dick with director John Huston. Bradbury has said he wrote it after reading actress Katharine Hepburn's account of filming The African Queen with Huston in Africa. The title itself is a play on Peter Viertel's novel White Hunter, Black Heart, which is also about Huston. Bradbury considers Green Shadows to be the culmination of thirty-five years of short stories, poems, and plays that were inspired by his stay in Ireland. As with most of his previous short-story collections, including The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chronicles, many of the short stories were originally published elsewhere and modified slightly for publication in the novel."

The scientist injects his pregnant wife with the serum and his son Hugo Danner is born with superhuman strength, speed, and bulletproof skin. Hugo spends much of the novel hiding his powers, rarely getting a chance to openly use them. The novel is widely assumed to have been an inspiration for Superman, though no confirmation exists that Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were influenced by it."

  "text" : "Gerald’s Party is the fourth full-length novel written by Robert Coover, published in 1986. The book encompasses a single night at a party given by the title character and narrator, Gerald. Though the murder of a beautiful actress is central to the plot, Coover's text has little in common with a traditional murder mystery. He appears to be approaching the murder mystery genre with the goal of subverting/exhausting its possibilities. A comparable strategy can be seen in his retellings of fairy tales (see Briar Rose, Pricksongs), and his reframing of movie conventions (Ghost Town, A Night at the Movies). Like Coover's other later works, this is experimental fiction. The text regularly returns to themes of sex, violence, and a blurred boundary between theatre and reality."

  "text" : "Gub Gub's Book: An Encyclopedia of Food: In Twenty Volumes is a 1932 children's book in the Doctor Dolittle series by Hugh Lofting. Gub-Gub the pig was one of the first animals with whom Doctor Dolittle learned to talk and appears in most of the books. This book features stories from and about Gub-Gub's attempt to write an encyclopedia of food. The frontispiece of the book introduces \"An Encyclopedia of Food in Twenty Volumes\", going on to explain that \"Prof. GUB GUB Announces that Owing to the High Cost of Living the other 19 Volumes of this GREAT WORK have been Temporarily Postponed.\" The book takes the form of a Scheherazade story, with chapters unfolding evening by evening. As Gub-Gub deals patiently with his raucous animal friends, they are drawn into his world and find out such vital information on the food map as where King Alfred burnt the cakes. A book readable by adults as well as children, who will possibly better appreciate the value and practicality of the gingersnap hygrometer. The hyphen in the name Gub-Gub is replaced by a space on the dust jacket, on the title page, and on the dedication page; but the hyphen appears in the name elsewhere."

This book concludes the chronicles of the adventures of such diverse characters as Sir Richard Burton, Alice Pleasance Liddell, Aphra Behn and Tom Turpin through a bizarre afterlife in which every human ever to have lived is simultaneously resurrected along a single river valley that stretches over an entire planet. Although Farmer's 1980 novel The Magic Labyrinth was originally intended to be the last in the series, Farmer continued it in this novel, which picks up with the characters who have just arrived in the alien-built tower at the headwaters of the river from which this constructed world gets its name; they must decide how to use the resurrection machinery they now control, and also solve the mystery of the murder of the mysterious stranger."

A sequel, Terra-Farma, was also published.

  "text" : "(This article is about the canyon in the southwestern United States. For other Grand Canyons, see Grand Canyon (disambiguation).) The Grand Canyon (Hopi: Ongtupqa; Yavapai: Wi:kaʼi:la, Navajo: Tsékooh Hatsoh, Spanish: Gran Cañón) is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in the state of Arizona in the United States. It is contained within and managed by Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Tribal Nation, the Havasupai people and the Navajo Nation. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters). Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists, several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago. Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon. For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it. The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was García López de Cárdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540."

  "text" : "The Garden of Kama is a book of lyric poetry published in 1901 and written by Adela Florence Nicolson under the pseudonym Laurence Hope. It was illustrated by Byam Shaw. The poems in the book were passed off as translations of Indian poets by a man, and thus the book received much more attention that they would likely have done if she had published them under her own name. All of the poems in the book were original works; none was actually a translation. The poetry in this volume was characteristic of all of Nicolson's poems, making liberal use of the imagery and symbols from the poets of the North-West Frontier of India and the Sufi poets of Persia. The poems are typically about unrequited love and loss. The book was initially praised upon its released by many prominent poets, Thomas Hardy among them, although some reviewers were uncertain about the authenticity of the translations. James Darmesteter, Professor of Persian at the prestigious College de France, Paris, documented the images used by the frontier \"bards\" as being symbols of the latent Sufi nature of their songs and they were \"exposed\" as being original works. The book was published in America in 1927 as India's Love Lyrics."

There are elements that tend toward accommodation, collaboration, or even idealization of the French colonials. At the same time the story details the strikers who work against the mistreatment of the Senegalese people. The novel was translated into English in 1962 and published by William Heinemann as God's Bits of Wood as part of their influential African Writers Series."

  "text" : "God's Little Acre is a 1933 novel by Erskine Caldwell about a dysfunctional farming family in Georgia obsessed with sex and wealth. The novel's sexual themes were so controversial that the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice asked a New York state court to censor it. The novel was made into a film of the same name in 1958. Though controversial, the novel became an international best seller with over 10 million copies sold. The novel is Caldwell's most popular novel, though Caldwell's reputation is often tied to Tobacco Road (novel) which was listed in the Modern Library 100 Best Novels."

  "text" : "Grendel is a 1971 novel by American author John Gardner. It is a retelling of part of the Old English poem Beowulf from the perspective of the antagonist, Grendel. In the novel, Grendel is portrayed as an antihero. The novel deals with finding meaning in the world, the power of literature and myth, and the nature of good and evil. In a 1973 interview, Gardner said that \"In Grendel I wanted to go through the main ideas of Western Civilization – which seemed to me to be about . . . twelve? – and go through them in the voice of the monster, with the story already taken care of, with the various philosophical attitudes (though with Sartre in particular), and see what I could do, see if I could break out\". On another occasion he noted that he \"us[ed] Grendel to represent Sartre's philosophical position\" and that \"a lot of Grendel is borrowed from sections of Sartre's Being and Nothingness. Grendel has become one of Gardner's best known and reviewed works. Several editions of the novel contain pen and ink line drawings of Grendel's head, by Emil Antonucci. Ten years after publication, the novel was adapted into the 1981 animated movie Grendel Grendel Grendel."

  "text" : "Gulls of Europe, Asia and North America by Klaus Malling Olsen and Hans Larsson is a volume in the Helm Identification Guides series of bird identification books. The book is intended to succeed Peter J. Grant's Gulls: A Guide to Identification as the standard identification work on Northern Hemisphere gulls. Although the Helm series already contained a volume on seabirds, by Peter Harrison, gulls compete for space in that volume with several other seabird families; in addition, Harrison's book was published in 1983, a time when knowledge of gull identification (and taxonomy) was in a considerably more primitive state (and Harrison himself was a specialist in pelagic birds rather than gulls specifically). Malling Olsen & Larsson's book equals or exceeds Grant's work in terms of its level of detail, and consolidates and synthesises the considerable amount of new information that has been discovered since then. The first edition of Olsen and Larsson's book was released in 2003. While the book was initially generally well-received, a large number of errors soon came to light. As a result, this edition was withdrawn, and a reprint with corrections was released in 2004. Because the publishers required only the title page of the book to be returned in order for purchasers to receive the reprint free of charge, many copies of the first printing are still in circulation. (Those with a title page are identifiable by the absence of the words \"Reprinted with corrections 2004\" below the publisher's address on reverse of the title page.) The ISBN of the corrected reprint is ISBN 0-7136-7087-8. The corrected reprint has 608 pages. In total, 43 species are given full treatment by this work — identification text, colour plates by Larsson, and several colour photographs (the plates and photographs are placed with the species texts, not grouped together in a separate section). In addition, three Southern Hemisphere species which have occurred as vagrants in the Northern Hemisphere (band-tailed gull, grey gull and swallow-tailed gull) are covered more briefly in an appendix, with a single photograph each, and brief mention is also made here of silver gull which has occurred as an escape from captivity. Preceding the species accounts, an introduction covers the book's species-level taxonomy, and gives general advice on gull identification, including ageing and moult, hybrid and aberrant birds, and the effects of lighting conditions, and plumage wear and fading. The book is particularly notable in that it is the first work to bring together information discovered during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 21st century on the identification of birds of the large white-headed gull complex. The book adopts a conservative approach at higher taxonomic levels, lumping all gulls (except for ivory gull, Ross's gull and the two kittiwakes) in the genus Larus. A revised taxonomy is adopted at the species level, however; a number of distinctive forms (mainly in the large white-headed gull complex) are regarded as separate species. Species-level taxonomic decisions adopted in the book are as follows: \n* American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) is treated as a separate species from European herring gull (L. argentatus) \n* Yellow-legged gull (L. michahellis) (including the form atlantis) and Armenian gull (L. armenicus) are treated as separate species from the European herring gull \n* Caspian gull (L. cachinnans) is treated as a separate species from European herring and yellow-legged gulls, and is defined as including the forms barabensis and mongolicus \n* Heuglin's gull (L. heuglini) (including the form taimyrensis) and Vega gull (L. vegae) (including the form birulai) are each given full species status \n*  Common gull (L. canus) (including the forms heinei and kamschatensis) and mew gull (L. brachyrhynchus) are treated as separate species. Olsen and Larsson had previously collaborated on two other volumes in the Helm series, on terns and skuas."

  "text" : "Gojiro is the 1991 debut novel by former Esquire columnist Mark Jacobson. It reinterprets the Godzilla film series from the perspective of the daikaiju—not a fictional creature depicted on-screen via suitmation, but an irradiated varanid-turned B-movie star named Gojiro (an homage to Gojira, the Japanese name for Godzilla). Gojiro, a freak mutation with a cynical worldview, suffers the pain of solitude as well as several maladies experienced by entertainers, including drug abuse and suicidal tendencies. The story revolves around his adventures with human friend Komodo, a scientific genius scarred as a child by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as they attempt to fulfill their \"Triple Ring Promise\" to bring about world peace. The odyssey takes them from their home on Radioactive Island—also home to several children, called Atoms, suffering from radiation sickness—to several locations in Hollywood and the Trinity site in New Mexico. The novel is often compared to John Gardner's earlier novel Grendel, a retelling of the Beowulf epic through the eyes of the monster."

Weatherford provides a different slant on Genghis Khan than has been typical in most Western accounts, attributing positive cultural effects to his rule. In the last section, he reviews the historiography of Genghis Khan in the West and argues that the leader's early portrayal in writings as an \"excellent, noble king\" changed to that of a brutal pagan during the Age of Enlightenment. Weatherford made use of three major non-Western sources: The Secret History of the Mongols, the Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā of Juvayni and the Jami al-Tawarikh of Rashid-al-Din Hamadani."

She did only have her heart shattered and then stepped on all by Ben. Anna didn’t know what to do, she had to change from staring into Ben’s beautiful eyes to looking at Adams blue star tattoo. Adam was at the wedding with Anna, Ben, Cammie, Dee and Sam. Adam fell in love with Anna at first sight but Anna was with Ben. Cammie, Dee, and Sam were “best friends” but never seemed to tell each other anything about their personal lives and their plans. Cammie who is queen bee with her gorgeous strawberry blonde hair and lovely body shape, couldn’t quite win Ben back, Ben wanted Anna. When Ben and Anna see each other on the boardwalk, Anna is with Adam, Ben is with his cousin who he pretends is his girlfriend to make Anna jealous. But Ben felt like a loser with a broken heart. Anna is able to score another internship but its in the afternoon after school which means she will still have to go to senior year. Susan, Anna’s sister is fresh out of rehab and sober. But we will see how long that lasts. Susan is Susan. Sam and Anna become partners for a school project and head out to the V’s to do some filming. Anna calls up Ben saying she is no longer seeing Adam, except she calls from the Hotel Phone. So Ben heads up to the V’s to try and win Anna back. But it doesn’t happen. Anna is assigned to be Brock Franklin, a writer from New Yorks, friend at the Party. When Anna loses Brock she finds Susan intoxicated with Cammie, and Anna made sure Cammie knew about Susan. Sam saved the day and gave Anna and Susan a ride home without making a big deal. And on Annas way out she finds her boss, Margaret, with Brock who also seems to have a drinking problem. When Anna is to return to work on Monday, she has to face Margaret. Not to mention Cammies dad is the head of the company Annas internship is with, Apex. When Anna is shocked that she still has the job, it means that Margaret is dead to Anna meaning they are not to talk to each other or interact with each other. Sam offers a small getaway to Santa Barbara. When Anna goes for a small run on the beach Ben catches up to her to tell her the truth about what really happened that night. Anna forgives Ben and they redo that night."

  "text" : "Go Ask Malice: A Slayer's Diary is an original novel based on the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The author, Robert Joseph Levy, also wrote the Buffyverse novel The Suicide King. The book's title references Go Ask Alice, a controversial book which was an account of drug abuse. In turn, that book's own title is a reference to the Jefferson Airplane song, \"White Rabbit\", which includes the lyrics, \"Go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall.\" Grace Slick wrote the song after noticing possible drug references in Alice in Wonderland."

It has been republished in English as George; or, the Planter of the Isle of France. A new translation by Tina Kover, edited by Werner Sollors and with an introduction by Jamaica Kincaid, was published by Random House, Inc./Modern Library in May 2007."

Going Too Far was published by Dolphin Doubleday in New York. In the book, Hendra talks about the history of anti-establishment humor, starting with pioneers such as Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce and also later comics such as John Belushi and Eddie Murphy. Hendra also discusses improvisational theater groups, including The Second City, and popular anti-establishment magazines such as National Lampoon magazine and Mad Magazine. The book is also partly a memoir about Hendra's time at National Lampoon magazine. The second half of the book (Part Two–Fusion) is primarily about the magazine and its related projects."

  "text" : "The Gandalara Cycle is a series of seven Fantasy/Science Fiction paperback books created and written by authors Randall Garrett and Vicki Ann Heydron beginning in 1981. Ricardo Carillo, an aging language professor with a terminal illness, is flirting with a captivating young woman on a Mediterranean cruise ship. They both watch with wonder, and a growing horror, as a dazzlingly beautiful star quickly grows to engulf the sky and then crashes into the ship. Ricardo awakens in a blinding hot desert, with no idea where he is and a dead man by his side. Without knowing how or why, Ricardo finds himself inhabiting the body of a strong, healthy, young man named Markasset. Ricardo quickly learns that Markasset is wanted for murder and the theft of a precious and powerful gemstone, the Ra'ira. Ricardo has only a smattering of Markasset's memories, and no idea if he is guilty or innocent. But with the help of a giant warcat named Keeshah, with whom he shares a telepathic bond, and the beautiful illusionist, Tarani, Ricardo sets out on a quest to recover the missing gemstone and clear his new name. But what has happened to Markasset? And when will he want his body back? Now that he has a new lease on life, can Ricardo let it go? The series is full of vivid characters, swordplay, great warcats, and a desert world called Gandalara...a kind of alien Arabian Nights. Originally released as seven novels, the series was repackaged into three volumes (The Gandalara Cycle I, The Gandalara Cycle II, & The River Wall). In the 1986 edition of the Gandalara Cycle II two of the books are out of order. The Search for KÄ appears after Return to Eddarta."

The book explores the causes of the hostage-taking (mostly from the American perspective), commenting on the events which took place in the embassy. The book also describes the aftermath of the hostages' release following the onset of the Iran–Iraq War in September 1980. The book was made into a Discovery Times Channel special. Bowden's son, Aaron Bowden, was the head writer on the TV project produced by Wild Eyes Productions. The television program first aired on June 26, 2006. There are four parts to the documentary: Takeover, Captivity, Rescue Mission and Endgame. Bowden has signed an agreement with Paramount studios and producer Scott Rudin to allow a film adaptation of the book."

Andrews died in 1986, and her estate commissioned ghostwriter Andrew Neiderman to continue writing novels under her name developed from plot outlines originally written by Andrews. There is some dispute over whether this particular novel was written in part by Andrews before she died, or whether it was written entirely by Neiderman. This is the fifth novel of the Dollanganger series. The novel explains the origin of Olivia Winfield (the grandmother from Flowers in the Attic) and the events that cause her to become the cold, domineering mistress of Foxworth Hall and how Corinne's childhood and eventual betrayal come about. The story takes place between the years of 1918-1957."

When first published in the United States by The Crime Club in February 1933, the title was modified to The Saint's Getaway which was later adopted by future UK editions. Prior to being published in book form, Getaway had appeared in The Thriller magazine under the titles Property of the Deceased and Two Men from Munich. Charteris, in his introduction to a mid-1960s reprint of the book for Fiction Publishing Company, describes Getaway as the third part of a trilogy of novels that began with The Last Hero and Knight Templar."

  "text" : "Ghost Stories of an Antiquary is the title of M. R. James' first collection of ghost stories, published in 1904 (some had previously appeared in magazines). Some later editions under this title contain both the original collection and its successor, More Ghost Stories (1911), combined in one volume. Montague Rhodes James (1862–1936) was a paleographer and medievalist scholar; Provost of King's College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions. His style of writing can be considered as \"gothic\"."

  "text" : "Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods is an epic fantasy children's novel by Suzanne Collins. It is the third book in The Underland Chronicles, and was first published by Scholastic in 2005. The novel takes place a few months after the events of the preceding book, in the same subterranean world known as the Underland. In this installment, the young protagonist Gregor is once again recruited by the Underland's inhabitants, this time to help cure a rapidly-spreading plague. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods has been published as stand-alone hardcovers and paperbacks, as well as part of a boxed set. It was released as an audiobook on December 13, 2005, read by Paul Boehmer. In August 2010, it was released in ebook form. It has been lauded for \"[addressing] a number of political issues ... in a manner accessible to upper elementary and middle school readers\"."

Though the stories are not related, several reflect Wallace's concern with contemporary trends in fiction, including metafiction and the irony of postmodernism; and the cynical, amoral realism of \"Brat Pack\" writers such as Bret Easton Ellis. Others address society's fascination with celebrity, some with characters based on real people, including Alex Trebek, David Letterman and Lyndon Johnson. A novella, \"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\", closes the book, as an extended response to John Barth's metafictional short story \"Lost in the Funhouse\"."

As with many of his early books which were considered unsuitable for publication when they were first submitted as manuscripts, this was not science fiction, but rather a work of straight literary fiction. The manuscript was 481 pages in length. At the time it was published, it was one of only two Dick novels for which the manuscript was known to exist which remained unpublished. The other, Voices from the Street, was published in 2007. Dwight Brown wrote the afterword. As of 2011, the original hardcover edition was out of print; in July 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released a trade paperback edition of Gather Yourselves Together, complete with Brown's afterword."

  "text" : "Gay-Neck, the Story of a Pigeon is a 1928 children's novel by Dhan Gopal Mukerji that won the Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1928. It deals with the life of Gay-Neck, a prized Indian pigeon. Mukerji wrote that \"the message implicit in the book is that man and winged animals are brothers.\" He stated that much of the book is based on his boyhood experiences with a flock of forty pigeons and their leader, as the boy in the book is Mukerji himself. He did have to draw from the experiences of others for some parts of the book, such as those who trained messenger pigeons in the war. The book offers an insight into the life of a boy of high caste during the early 1900s and also into the training of pigeons. Several chapters are told from Gay-Neck's perspective, with the pigeon speaking in first person. Elizabeth Seeger writes in a biographical note about Mukerji that, \"Gay-Neck was written in Brittany, where every afternoon he read to the children gathered about him on the beach the chapter he had written in the morning.\" In an article in the children’s literature journal The Lion and the Unicorn, Meena G. Khorana calls the novel one of the few children’s novels from Western or Indian authors to explore the Himalayas in a meaningful way (rather than simply using them as a setting), and notes the way Mukerji recalls their “grandeur and spiritual power”."

  "text" : "Golden Checkerboard (1965) is a book by Ed Ainsworth. Its subject matter concerns the mid-20th century economic conditions of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians of Palm Springs, California, and the history of the 99-year lease law which enabled them to commercially develop tribal owned lands. It focuses on Indio Superior Court Judge Hilton McCabe, who is described as \"The Little White Father of the Indians of Palm Springs\", and recalls the steps taken by McCabe to set up conservatorships and leases that would give the tribe investment opportunities and economic self-sufficiency. The title of the book refers to the Agua Caliente Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' reservation checkerboard pattern, originating from land grants to the Southern Pacific Railroad as an incentive to build rail lines through the region, when President Ulysses S. Grant signed an Executive Order granting \"San Bernardino Base and Meridian, Township 4 South, Range 4 East, Section 14\" to the Agua Caliente Indians."

  "text" : "Glory (Russian: Подвиг) is a Russian novel written by Vladimir Nabokov between 1930 and 1932 and first published in Paris. The novel has been seen by some critics as a kind of fictional dress-run-through of the author's famous memoir Speak, Memory. Its Swiss-Russian hero, Martin Edelweiss, shares a number of experiences and sensations with his creator: goal-tending at Cambridge University, Cambridge fireplaces, English morning weather, a passion for rail travel. It is, however, the story of an émigré family's escape from Russia, a young man's education in England, and his (perhaps) disastrous return to the nation of his birth—the \"feat\" of the novel's Russian title."

  "text" : "Go, Dog. Go! is a 1961 children's book written and illustrated by P. D. Eastman. The book describes the actions and interactions of a group of highly mobile dogs, who operate cars and other conveyances in pursuit of work, play, and a final mysterious goal: a dog party. The book introduces concepts such as color and relative position with simple language and humor. (\"The blue dog is in. The red dog is out.\") Throughout the book, details in Eastman's illustrations seem to invite the reader to notice the deeper significance of small things. In their first appearance, a girl dog asks a boy dog if he likes her hat with its little flower. He does not; they part. Several pages later, we meet them again. Now they are riding scooters; she has a hat with a feather. Again, he does not like her hat, but as they part, he has made off with the feather. When we next see them together, they are skiing. The boy dog does not like the long ski cap the girl dog is wearing. They part as she bids him an angry farewell. In their final meeting her hat is even more elaborate and finally meets the approval of the boy dog; in this way a relationship is developed between the characters despite the simplicity of the text. In 2003, a musical version of the book for the stage was created by Steven Dietz and Allison Gregory for the Seattle Children's Theatre. This play has been widely staged throughout the US, often as an introduction to theater for young children."

  "text" : "Gertrude and Claudius is a novel by John Updike. It uses the known sources of Shakespeare's Hamlet to tell a story that draws on a rather straightforward revenge tale in the medieval Denmark depicted by Saxo Grammaticus in his twelfth-century Historiae Danicae, but incorporates extra plot elements added by François de Belleforest in his Histoires tragiques, published in 1576. And, finally, it brings in various elements from Shakespeare's play, including the name \"Corambis\" for Polonius from the \"bad quarto\" of 1603. This story, in its three forms, is primarily concerned with Hamlet (or \"Amleth\" in Saxo) avenging his father's murder, but the story starts earlier. The novel is concerned with that earlier life of Gertrude, Claudius, and old Hamlet, and it ends at the close of Act I, scene ii of Hamlet. The characters have different names in Saxo, Belleforest, and Shakespeare (e.g. Gerutha, Geruthe, Gertrude), and the novel, in three parts, modulates the names as the play's time approaches. The story takes elements from all three predecessors, but is consistent (arguably) only with Shakespeare's. For example, the murder that was public knowledge in Saxo and Belleforest becomes secret in Shakespeare and also in this story. But Belleforest introduces the adultery between Gertrude and Claudius (Shakespeare is ambiguous on this point), and further, implies that Gertrude encouraged Claudius to murder her husband. Updike takes the adultery, and makes it an appealing love affair. Gertrude is a sensual, somewhat neglected wife, Claudius a rather dashing fellow, and old Hamlet an unpleasant combination of brutal Viking raider and coldly ambitious politician. But Updike has Claudius kill his brother without Gertrude's knowledge or encouragement. Finally, Gertrude has definite intimations of a ghost of her dead husband, and Claudius hears rumors of a midnight spirit in armour roving the battlements. The ghost is only Shakespearean. Hamlet spends most of the novel's time offstage, as it were: a young child shunted off to nursemaids, a boy left to mischief with the disorderly Yorick, or a seemingly perpetual student living in Wittenberg. He never speaks for himself, and is seen very briefly only twice. But as the story ends he is finally back home at Elsinore, and Claudius feels that the resentful young man can be trained up into a properly domesticated prince and, matched with Ophelia (presented as a pretty but rather vacant young woman), reliably produce heirs to extend this benign dynasty..."

An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form. It has also been translated into French, Italian and German. The book has the distinction of being de Camp's first science fiction novel, and Miller's only novel. It is perhaps the earliest novel dealing with the afterwards popular theme of humanity being replaced by intelligent apes in the future, later epitomized by Pierre Boulle's Planet of the Apes."

A man, a Spaniard named Gil Braltar, dresses up as a monkey and becomes leader of a group of monkeys living there (Barbary macaques). He incites attack on the fortress. The attack, initially successful, is foiled by a British general. This general is so ugly that the monkeys believe he was one of them and obey him when he leads them out. Verne's conclusion is that in the future only the ugliest generals will be sent to Gibraltar to keep the colony in British hands."

  "text" : "Godan (Hindi: गोदान, gōdān, lit. 'Cow donation') is a Hindi novel by Munshi Premchand, translated into English as The Gift of a Cow. It was first published in 1936 and is considered one of the greatest Hindustani novels of modern Indian literature. Themed around the socio economic deprivation as well as the exploitation of the village poor, the novel was the last complete novel of Premchand. It was translated into English in 1957 by Jai Ratan and P. Lal translation; a 1968 translation by Gordon C. Roadarmel is now considered \"a classic in itself\". Godaan was made into a Hindi film in 1963, starring Rajkumar, Mehmood and Shashikala. In 2004, Godan was part of the 26-episode TV series, Tehreer.... Munshi Premchand Ki, based on the writing of Premchand, starring Pankaj Kapur and Surekha Sikri, directed by Gulzar and produced by Doordarshan."

The story was first published in 1991 in a special limited edition by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art; this was followed by a mass market hardcover edition in 1995 by High Risk Books and a paperback edition published after Burroughs' death. The novella, primarily set in Madagascar, initially focuses on a character named Captain Mission, founder of the pirate colony Libertatia, and is described on the back cover of the 1995 edition as being \"an important story about environmental devastation.\" Following Mission's death in the narrative, the novella moves into the present day and tells of a series of deadly viruses that plague humankind, including one that causes people to believe they have the powers of Jesus Christ and another that causes uncontrollable hair growth. The narrative also switches to discussing the real-life endangerment of lemurs in Madagascar and the story ends with the author requesting readers donate to the Duke University Primate Center. Burroughs' longtime collaborator Brion Gysin, who died several years before the book was published, is referenced by name several times, and the book includes a brief narrative segment that Burroughs had recorded for his 1990 album Dead City Radio under the title \"Brion Gysin's All-Purpose Bedtime Story.\""

He agrees to take part in an experiment, during which he is placed inside a model of a late twentieth/early twenty-first century Euroamerican society. Robin is given a new identity and body, specifically that of a woman named \"Reeve\". Major themes of this novel are identity, gender determinism, self-image- and conformity. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a sequel to his 2005 novel Accelerando, although Stross has stated that the two novels are not obviously incompatible. Glasshouse won the Prometheus Award for 2007, and was nominated for the Hugo, Campbell, and Locus Awards in 2007."

With illustrations made of cut-paper collages, it is Wisniewski's retelling of the Jewish folktale of the Golem, with real people, real places, and a one-page background at the end. The story is set in year 1580 in Prague, and the Jews are being persecuted. Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the town rabbi, can think of nothing more than creating a being out of mud and bringing it to life, using the holy name of God, to protect them. Once the Golem stops the persecution, Rabbi Loew erases the letters on the Golem's head, making the Golem \"sleep the dreamless sleep of clay\". The ending is ambiguous, ending with the words: \"But many say he could awaken. Perhaps when the desperate need for justice is united with holy purpose, Golem will come to life once more.\" This retelling is one of the few retellings in which the Golem has a name—it is Joseph. The book won the Caldecott Medal in 1997."

  "text" : "Growing Pains is the title of Billie Piper's autobiography, released 19 October 2006 by Hodder & Stoughton. Piper signed a six-figure contract with publishers Hodder & Stoughton to write her autobiography Growing Pains, which was released in the autumn of 2006. Apparently (according to a Top Gear interview), Piper only released the autobiography due to an unauthorised biography coming out. In the book, Piper divulges about her battle with anorexia that developed after a television presenter called her fat when she was a 16-year-old pop star. Piper began to use laxatives as well as starvation to drop weight. During a US promotional tour, she contemplated suicide as a result of low record sales and self-doubt. She admits to managing five days without food during which time she existed on nothing more than Diet Coke and coffee. She also stated that her relationship with Chris Evans made her ditch her starvation diet and gave her a new zest for life. However, after her split with Evans, Piper returned to anorexia. In the autobiography, Piper said that eating disorders were rife among the girls at her former school, the Sylvia Young Theatre School. Young has since spoken out against Piper calling her claim \"rubbish\" and stating she feels \"bewildered\" by the allegation. In recent publication, a re-issue of her autobiography has been printed. The re-issue features critics' reviews on the back, a completely different cover and an extension chapter. There are 4 special photo sections in the book."

Meher Baba on L.S.D. and The High Roads was a 1966 pamphlet containing messages from Meher Baba speaking out against taking illicit drugs such as marijuana and LSD, ultimately saying they were harmful \"physically, mentally, and spiritually.\" The pamphlet was published in 1966 by Sufism Reoriented using quotes by Meher Baba where he disparaged the view that hallucinogenic and psychedelic drugs, especially LSD, but also marijuana, psilocybin, and other drugs, might be used to elicit meaningful spiritual insight. Meher Baba wrote, \"If God can be found through the medium of any drug, God is not worthy of being God.\" It was compiled from letters to several academics in the West including Allan Cohen, Robert Dreyfuss and Richard Alpert. The pamphlet went out of print, but in 2003 the material was republished in A Mirage Will Never Quench Your Thirst, A Source of Wisdom About Drugs by Laurent Weichberger (Sheriar Foundation, 2003). The new book has material not contained in the original God in A Pill? and a section entitled God in A Pill? Revisited, which reprints those quotes from God in A Pill? which were directly from Meher Baba related to drugs."

An underworld of drug-fueled parties, bars, clubs and free love is explored through the eyes of character Paul Hobbes, Holmes' representation of himself in the novel. Hobbes is torn between joining his friends in their riotous existence and trying to maintain his relatively stable life and marriage to his wife Kathryn."

The bibliography has a long list of original sources and other notable books in the field. The level of the book is advanced, with the intended audience at the graduate-level and above."

  "text" : "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Intimate Diary of a Professional Lady is a comic novel written by Anita Loos, first published in 1925. It is one of several famous novels published that year to chronicle the so-called Jazz Age, including Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Van Vechten's Firecrackers. Loos was inspired to write the book after watching a sexy blonde turn intellectual H. L. Mencken into a lovestruck schoolboy. Mencken, a close friend, actually enjoyed the work and saw to it that it was published. Originally published as a magazine series in Harper's Bazaar, it was published as a book by Boni & Liveright in 1925 and became a runaway best seller, becoming the second best selling title of 1926 and earning the praise of no less than Edith Wharton who dubbed it \"The Great American Novel.\" A sequel, But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes, was published two years later."

Dennis' half-brother, Lane, recently attempted to commit suicide, and has just been released from a state mental institution following this attempt to end his life.

Published in 1975, Grimus was Salman Rushdie's first published novel. To a large extent it has been disparaged by academic critics; though Peter Kemp's comment is particularly vitriolic, it does give an idea of the novel's initial reception: \"His first novel, Grimus (1975), a ramshackle surreal saga based on a 12th-century Sufi poem and copiously encrusted with mythic and literary allusion, nosedived into oblivion amid almost universal critical derision.\""

It is a detective story where the psychological portrait of Victor Karosky, the serial killer (which name is known from the first line of the book) is the spine of the novel. The action also takes place in a Maryland institution called the Saint Matthew Institute, a center for the rehabilitation of priest with a history of sexual abuse, which is based in a real life place. This subject has aroused controversial issues in Catholic countries as Spain and Poland."

  "text" : "Grandfather Stories is a book of 23 historical tales by journalist and novelist Samuel Hopkins Adams. Three were originally published in Woman's Day and 15 in The New Yorker. Most of the stories take place in upper New York State, along the Erie Canal. Those stories told by his grandfather occur in the 1820s; others, when Adams was a boy in the 1870s and 1880s. Adams does not state how much of the tales is fact and how much is fiction; some are clearly his own memoirs, others are historical fiction, and still others seem to be a reconstruction of his grandfather's life experiences. On the book's publication, the New York Times reviewer, Carl Carmer raved, \"Few recent presentations of the national past—fictional or factual—carry so much detailed background, authentic, feeling atmosphere and engaging charm.\" A distinctive feature of the book is Adams's liberal use of his grandfather's archaic vocabulary and phrasings. \"He has...the ability to bring obsolete words back to us with all their old life and vigor.\" The book has been referenced by scholars of American speech and as a primary source in historical research on the early days of the Erie Canal. Most of the sketches begin with the young Adams and his cousins sitting uncomfortably in their grandfather's parlor in Rochester, New York, hoping to distract him into telling a story instead of improving their morals. Myron Adams had had a colorful youth; in the early 1820s, his father won a contract to dig a section of the Erie Canal. As a result, he became an insider among canal folk. He was a well-respected businessman in the region: as such, he traveled frequently through upstate New York. Among his adventures, he was selected as judge for a pie-eating contest, watched the daredevil Sam Patch jump to his death from Rochester's High Falls, charmed the visiting English feminist Frances Wright, helped a runaway slave escape to Canada, and was present, Adams maintains, at the very first preview of the motion picture. The tales are nuggets of social history: among them, New Year customs in Rochester's elite \"ruffleshirt\" Third Ward, early professional baseball in Rochester, the corrupt matches that killed off professional rowing, and the invention of the detachable shirt collar in Troy, New York. Adams describes his meeting as a boy with the abolitionist and slave-rescuer Harriet Tubman, who was helped by his family after she settled in nearby Auburn. Grandfather Stories has been suggested as a travel guide to Upstate New York."

In the book, Hitchens contends that organised religion is \"violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children\" and sectarian, and that accordingly it \"ought to have a great deal on its conscience.\" Hitchens supports his position with a mixture of personal stories, documented historical anecdotes and critical analysis of religious texts. His commentary focuses mainly on the Abrahamic religions, although it also touches on other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism."

A lengthy philosophical preface takes the form of a letter to Hobbes, and is printed in the first edition with Hobbes' own reply and comments. Though Davenant asserted that the completed work would be in five sections or \"books\", only the first two books and part of the third book were completed."

  "text" : "Growing Up Brady: I Was A Teenage Greg is a 1992 autobiography written by actor Barry Williams with Chris Kreski and a foreword by Robert Reed. In Growing Up Brady, Williams discusses his childhood, the production of the 1969–1974 ABC sitcom The Brady Bunch, his relationship with co-star Maureen McCormick, disputes between series star Robert Reed and creator-producer Sherwood Schwartz, and various Brady Bunch spin-offs. An episode guide to the series is also included, as well as three negative critiques from Reed of the episodes \"The Impractical Joker\" and \"And Now a Word From Our Sponsor\" (both 1971), and \"The Hair-Brained Scheme\" (the series finale from 1974, in which Reed refused to appear). Two editions of the book exist: the first edition details his Brady co-stars attending his 1990 wedding to Diane Martin; that marriage ended in divorce two years later; the second edition, published several years later, replaces the references to Martin with his impressions of the feature films The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel, and reflections on Reed's death in 1992 due to cancer and the subsequent media frenzy over the news that Reed had been diagnosed as HIV positive (misreported as AIDS) prior to his death."

  "text" : "Ghost Blows Out the Light (Chinese: 鬼吹灯; pinyin: Guǐ Chuīdēng), also referred to as Candle in the Tomb, is a fantasy novel written by Zhang Muye (天下霸唱) about two grave robbers seeking hidden treasure, and first published online in March 2006. It quickly became the bestselling online novel in China with an estimated readership of six million, and when published in print form in October the same year, went on to sell over 500,000 copies, although the book had to be rewritten to remove references to the supernatural before it could be released. Set in the 1980s, the novel follows former soldier Hu Bayi and his partner as they raid tombs in search of valuables. The two team up with an American archaeologist after they fall victim to a curse, and to release themselves from it they must seek clues found among ancient mythical sites across China. The title is derived from an old Chinese saying, credited by the author to genuine grave robbers: \"A human lights the candle and the ghosts blow it out.\" According to Muye, grave robbers would place a candle in the south-east corner of a tomb after entering, in an attempt to make contact with the dead. If the candle was extinguished it was a sign that the spirits within opposed the intrusion, and the robbers would be obliged to depart, leaving everything intact and undisturbed. In July 2007, it was reported that Hollywood film studio New Line Cinema was planning a movie adaptation of the novel. It was stated that one of the two lead actors was to be Qian Zhijun, the teenager whose face was behind the Xiao Pang internet phenomenon, while other roles would be played by established Hong Kong movie stars. There has already been a bestselling online game released based on the book, while a play is also mooted."

The world itself started as a simple dungeon under a castle designed by Gary Gygax for the amusement of his children and friends, but it rapidly expanded to include not only a complex multi-layered dungeon environment, but also the nearby city of Greyhawk, and eventually an entire world. In addition to the campaign world, which was published in several editions over twenty years, Greyhawk was also used as the setting for many adventures published in support of the game, as well as for RPGA's massively shared Living Greyhawk campaign from 2000–2008."

In it, she revealed the hermeticism with which the Renaissance was imbued, and the revived interest in mysticism, magic and Gnosticism of Late Antiquity that survived the Middle Ages. In the face of longstanding conventional interpretations, Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of heliocentricity. The book is cited by the bestselling British author Philip Pullman, as a central inspiration for his own writing."

  "text" : "In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good), and all loving. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial), and to be without any human biological sex, yet the concept of God actively creating the universe (as opposed to passively) has caused many religions to describe God using masculine terminology, using such terms as \"Him\" or \"Father\". Furthermore, some religions (such as Judaism) attribute only a purely grammatical \"gender\" to God. Incorporeity and corporeity of God are related to conceptions of transcendence (being outside nature) and immanence (being in nature, in the world) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the \"immanent transcendence\" of Chinese theology. God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal. In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself. In atheism, God is not believed to exist, while God is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of agnosticism. God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation, and the \"greatest conceivable existent\". Many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God. There are many names for God, and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about God's identity and attributes. In the ancient Egyptian era of Atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called Aten, premised on being the one \"true\" Supreme Being and creator of the universe. In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, \"He Who Is\", \"I Am that I Am\", and the tetragrammaton YHWH (Hebrew: יהוה‎‎, which means: \"I am who I am\"; \"He Who Exists\") are used as names of God, while Yahweh and Jehovah are sometimes used in Christianity as vocalizations of YHWH. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God, consubstantial in three persons, is called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Judaism, it is common to refer to God by the titular names Elohim or Adonai, the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the Egyptian Aten. In Islam, the name Allah, \"Al-El\", or \"Al-Elah\" (\"the God\") is used, while Muslims also have a multitude of titular names for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic concept of God. In Chinese religion, God is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly ordaining it. Other religions have names for God, for instance, Baha in the Bahá'í Faith, Waheguru in Sikhism, and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism. The many different conceptions of God, and competing claims as to God's characteristics, aims, and actions, have led to the development of ideas of omnitheism, pandeism, or a perennial philosophy, which postulates that there is one underlying theological truth, of which all religions express a partial understanding, and as to which \"the devout in the various great world religions are in fact worshipping that one God, but through different, overlapping concepts or mental images of Him.\""

  "text" : "Generation X is a 1965 165-page book on popular youth culture by British journalists, Jane Deverson and Charles Hamblett. It contains interviews with teenagers who were part of the Mod subculture. It began as a series of interviews in a 1964 study of British youth, commissioned by British lifestyle magazine Woman's Own where Deverson worked. The interviews detailed a culture of promiscuous and anti-establishment youth, and was seen as inappropriate for the magazine. Generation X, a punk rock band that English musician Billy Idol formed in 1976, was named after the book—a copy of which was owned by Idol's mother."

The book was written in biographical form nearly 60 years after the assassination of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and challenges his image as a saintly, benevolent, and pacifistic leader of Indian independence, told through Gandhi's own writings and actions over the course of his life. The book claims that Gandhi emulated racism from the Hindu ideology of caste towards the blacks of South Africa and the Untouchables, instigated ethnic hatred against foreign communities, and, to this end, was involved in covering up the killing of American engineer William Francis Doherty. Singh puts forward that the portrayal of Gandhi as a great leader is \"the work of the Hindu propaganda machine\" and Christian clergy with ulterior motives; and, furthermore, it was based on irrationality and deception which historians have failed to critically examine."

  "text" : "Gilgamesh in the Outback is a science fiction novella by Robert Silverberg, a sequel to his novel Gilgamesh the King as well as a story in the shared universe series Heroes in Hell. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1987 and was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 1986. Originally published in Asimov's Science Fiction, it was then printed in Rebels in Hell before being incorporated into Silverberg's novel To the Land of the Living. Real-life writers Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft feature as characters in the novella. Robert Silverberg wrote that he was \"drawn into\" writing a story for the \"Heroes in Hell\" project. While he remembered that the central concept of the series was \"never clearly explained\" to him, he noted the similarity of \"Heroes in Hell\" to Philip José Farmer's Riverworld works, and decided \"to run my own variant on what Farmer had done a couple of decades earlier.\" After writing \"Gilgamesh in the Outback,\" he decided that, since the story \"was all so much fun,\" to write two sequels, \"The Fascination of the Abomination\" and \"Gilgamesh in Uruk.\" In writing those stories, as Silverberg recalled, he \"never read many of the other 'Heroes in Hell' stories\", and had \"no idea\" of how consistent his work was with that of his \"putative collaborators\"; instead, he had \"gone his own way . . . with only the most tangential links to what others had invented.\" Silverberg compiled the three stories as To the Land of the Living, revising the stories to remove any references to other writers' contributions to \"Heroes in Hell\" to avoid copyright issues. To the Land of the Living was published in the British market in 1989 and reprinted in an American edition in 1990."

  "text" : "Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn is a fantasy novel by British author Robert Holdstock. It was originally published in the United States in 1997 (and in the United Kingdom under the title Gate of Ivory in 1998.) The story is a prequel to Mythago Wood and explores Christian Huxley's quest into Ryhope Wood and the apparent suicide of his mother, Jennifer Huxley. The title of the book refers to the gates of horn and ivory described in both Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. Because the story is a prequel, reading the novel Mythago Wood and the novella The Bone Forest will illuminate Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn for first time readers. Reading the Wikipedia article on Mythago Wood will help in understanding issues and terminology in this article."

The story is written using the motifs and laconic prose of the Icelandic sagas."

Often considered a continuation of Rhys' three other early novels, Quartet (1928), After Leaving Mr Mackenzie (1930) and Voyage in the Dark (1934), it is experimental in design and deals with a woman's feelings of vulnerability, depression, loneliness and desperation during the years between the two World Wars. The book initially sold poorly—critics thought it well written, but too depressing—and after its publication Rhys spent a decade living in obscurity. It was not until it was adapted into a theatrical production in 1949, and again into a radio play 1957 by the BBC, that Rhys was once again put into the spotlight."

  "text" : "Gather Together in My Name (1974) is a memoir by American writer and poet Maya Angelou. It is the second book in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The book begins immediately following the events described in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and follows Angelou, called Rita, from the ages of 17 to 19. Written three years after Caged Bird, the book \"depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime.\" The title of the book is taken from the Bible, but it also conveys how one black female lived in the white-dominated society of the U.S. following the Second World War. Angelou expands upon many themes that she started discussing in her first autobiography, including motherhood and family, racism, identity, education and literacy. Rita becomes closer to her mother in this book, and goes through a variety of jobs and relationships as she tries to provide for her young son and find her place in the world. Angelou continues to discuss racism in Gather Together, but moves from speaking for all Black women to describing how one young woman dealt with it. The book exhibits the narcissism of young people, but describes how Rita discovers her identity. Like many of Angelou's autobiographies, Gather Together is concerned with Angelou's on-going self-education. Gather Together was not as critically acclaimed as Angelou's first autobiography, but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as being better written than its predecessor. The book's structure, consisting of a series of episodes tied together by theme and content, parallels the chaos of adolescence, which some critics feel makes it an unsatisfactory sequel to Caged Bird. Rita's many physical movements throughout the book, which affects the book's organization and quality, has caused at least one critic to call it a travel narrative."

Going, Going, Gone mutes its sf armature, preferring the subtle to the spectacular, but it delivers the double-take brain thrill that true lovers of the form crave." ]

  "text" : "The Gulag (Russian: ГУЛАГ, tr. GULAG; IPA: [ɡʊˈlak] ; acronym of Russian Главное управление лагерей \"main administration of the camps\", usually translated \"Chief Directorate of Camps\") was the government agency that administered the main Soviet forced labour camp systems during the Stalin era, from the 1930s until the 1950s. The first such camps were created in 1918 and the term is widely used to describe any forced labor camp in the USSR. While the camps housed a wide range of convicts, from petty criminals to political prisoners, large numbers were convicted by simplified procedures, such as NKVD troikas and other instruments of extrajudicial punishment (the NKVD was the Soviet secret police). The Gulag is recognized as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union, based on Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code). The term is also sometimes used to describe the camps themselves, particularly in the West. \"GULAG\" was the acronym for Гла́вное управле́ние лагере́й (Glavnoye upravleniye lagerey), the \"Main Camp Administration\". It was the short form of the official name Гла́вное управле́ние исправи́тельно-трудовы́х лагере́й и коло́ний (Glavnoye upravleniye ispravityelno-trudovykh lagerey i koloniy), the \"Main Administration of Corrective Labor Camps and Labor Settlements\". It was administered first by the GPU, later by the NKVD and in the final years by the MVD, the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The first corrective labour camps after the revolution were established in 1918 (Solovki) and legalized by a decree \"On creation of the forced-labor camps\" on April 15, 1919. The internment system grew rapidly, reaching population of 100,000 in the 1920s and from the very beginning it had a very high mortality rate. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature, who spent eight years of Gulag incarceration, gave the term its international repute with the publication of The Gulag Archipelago in 1973. The author likened the scattered camps to \"a chain of islands\" and as an eyewitness described the Gulag as a system where people were worked to death. Some scholars support this view, though it is controversial, considering that with the obvious exception of the war years, a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive. In March 1940, there were 53 Gulag camp directorates (colloquially referred to as simply \"camps\") and 423 labor colonies in the USSR. Today's major industrial cities of the Russian Arctic, such as Norilsk, Vorkuta, and Magadan, were originally camps built by prisoners and run by ex-prisoners."

The book provides an in-depth account of Central Intelligence Agency activity in Afghanistan from the time of the Soviet Invasion to the aftermath of attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Particularly taken note of by Coll is the interplay between the CIA and its counterpart in Pakistan, Inter-Services Intelligence, which utilized CIA and Saudi Arabian funding to build militant Mujahideen training camps along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in an effort to create radicalized, militant fighters sourced from many Arab countries to attack the Soviet occupation. Invariably, as Coll shows, this decision would have long-lasting effects on the region. A slightly expanded edition, taking into account the work of the 9/11 Commission, was published by Penguin in 2005. In 2011, Coll announced a follow up to Ghost Wars. When asked about a release date for the book, Coll said \"It will take a while...I'd like the second volume to hold up over time\"."

The novel tells of a wealthy young man, Godfrey Morgan who, with his deportment instructor, Professor T. Artelett, embark from San Francisco, California on a round-the-world ocean voyage. They are cast away on an uninhabited Pacific island where they must endure a series of adversities. Later they encounter an African slave, Carefinotu, brought to the island by cannibals. In the end, the trio manage to work together and survive on the island. The novel is a robinsonade—a play on Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe."

The authors are from 42 countries on 6 continents and includes 15 pieces translated into English, primarily from Spanish and Mandarin. Paula Ettelbrick, Executive Director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission said \"Getting Bi is one of the most important recent contributions to the global struggle for human rights. By enriching our understanding of bisexuality within so many cultural and geographic contexts, this anthology serves as a magnificent tool for building support and respect for the sexual rights of each one of us.\" It is organized into nine themed chapters including \"What is Bisexuality?\", \"Coming Out as Bisexual\", \"Why Bi? (Coming to Terms)\", \"Life Stories\", \"Crossing Lines\", \"Bi's in Relationships\", \"Language of Desire\", \"Bisexual Politics\", \"Bi Community\", and \"Bisexual Worlds\", with additional sections of brief articles and resource lists.

Gilda Joyce is a psychic investigator, a spy and an undercover reporter, who solves mysteries of the supernatural using a Ouija board, her wits and her Masters Psychic Handbook, seeking the answer to various mysteries, such as solving a mysterious death, and discovering the secrets of the cryptic society of the Ladies of the Lake.

  "text" : "Gandhi Under Cross Examination is a 2009 book written by G. B. Singh and Dr. Tim Watson evaluating the iconization of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi as a civil rights protagonist In 1893 Gandhi went to South Africa where, according to his own account, he was thrown off of a train on racial grounds. In their scrutiny of the incident and Gandhi's statements thereafter, the authors claim that Gandhi gave divergent accounts of what happened on his journey to Pretoria. Gandhi Under Cross-examination catalogs the incidents that happened around that time and attempts to prove that the train incident never occurred. The authors have claimed that Gandhi lied about the train incident."

It reached No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in April 1947. The book was adapted into a 1947 film of the same name starring Gregory Peck. The book tells the story of Philip Green, new staff writer for a national magazine. A gentile, he is assigned by his magazine to tell the story of anti-Semitism. He decides to do that by telling people that he is Jewish. This ruse causes problems with his fiancee, who is a social climbing suburbanite and divorcee. Green's son is victimized by anti-Semitism as well, adding to the tension. The book received rave reviews, with The New York Times Book Review calling it \"required reading for every thoughtful citizen in this perilous century\". The Philadelphia Inquirer said it \"bids fair to being one of the most astonishing novels of the year\"."

  "text" : "In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good), and all loving. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial), and to be without any human biological sex, yet the concept of God actively creating the universe (as opposed to passively) has caused many religions to describe God using masculine terminology, using such terms as \"Him\" or \"Father\". Furthermore, some religions (such as Judaism) attribute only a purely grammatical \"gender\" to God. Incorporeity and corporeity of God are related to conceptions of transcendence (being outside nature) and immanence (being in nature, in the world) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the \"immanent transcendence\" of Chinese theology. God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal. In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself. In atheism, God is not believed to exist, while God is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of agnosticism. God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation, and the \"greatest conceivable existent\". Many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God. There are many names for God, and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about God's identity and attributes. In the ancient Egyptian era of Atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called Aten, premised on being the one \"true\" Supreme Being and creator of the universe. In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, \"He Who Is\", \"I Am that I Am\", and the tetragrammaton YHWH (Hebrew: יהוה‎‎, which means: \"I am who I am\"; \"He Who Exists\") are used as names of God, while Yahweh and Jehovah are sometimes used in Christianity as vocalizations of YHWH. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God, consubstantial in three persons, is called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Judaism, it is common to refer to God by the titular names Elohim or Adonai, the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the Egyptian Aten. In Islam, the name Allah, \"Al-El\", or \"Al-Elah\" (\"the God\") is used, while Muslims also have a multitude of titular names for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic concept of God. In Chinese religion, God is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly ordaining it. Other religions have names for God, for instance, Baha in the Bahá'í Faith, Waheguru in Sikhism, and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism. The many different conceptions of God, and competing claims as to God's characteristics, aims, and actions, have led to the development of ideas of omnitheism, pandeism, or a perennial philosophy, which postulates that there is one underlying theological truth, of which all religions express a partial understanding, and as to which \"the devout in the various great world religions are in fact worshipping that one God, but through different, overlapping concepts or mental images of Him.\""

  "text" : "Gollum is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He was introduced in the 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, and became an important supporting character in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields. Originally known as Sméagol, he was corrupted by the One Ring and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\". In Appendix F of The Lord of the Rings, the name Sméagol is said to be a \"translation\" of the actual Middle-earth name Trahald (having to do with the idea of \"burrowing\", and rendered with a name based on Old English smygel of similar meaning). The Ring, which Gollum referred to as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he had \"come to love and hate the Ring, just as he loved and hated himself.\" Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from Frodo Baggins at the Cracks of Doom in Orodruin in Mordor; but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed."

  "text" : "Gears of War is a video game franchise created and originally owned by Epic Games, developed and managed by The Coalition, and owned and published by Microsoft Studios. The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent & the Swarm. The franchise consists of four third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), continued Fenix and humanity’s ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released Gears of War: Judgment, a prequel to the series’ first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. The series' third sequel, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles new foes that threaten humanity. Gears of War was developed by Epic Games. Cliff Bleszinski, who has previously worked on Epic’s Unreal Tournament games, served the series’ lead game designer for the first three installments. He was inspired by gameplay elements from Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Bionic Commando. The series was also guided by Rod Fergusson, the executive producer and director of development of Epic Games until 2012. All four installments of the Gears of War series used a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 engine. On January 27, 2014, Microsoft acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games. Canadian studio The Coalition developed Gears of War 4, was released on October 11, 2016 for the Xbox One and Windows 10. Gears of War became one of the best-selling franchises for the Xbox 360. The series is well known for its emphasis on cover-based combat, in which players can use objects to avoid gunfire or safely engage enemies. All four installments in Gears of War featured several multiplayer modes that allowed players to compete against each other or team-up to battle AI opponents on Xbox Live. The Gears of War games have been amongst the most popular and most played titles on Xbox Live."

For reasons unknown, a small number of the teenaged dead are returning to 'life'. They lack a heartbeat and all other traditional life-signs (respiration, digestion, etc.) but are capable of thought, movement and speech (to varying extents). They are widely feared by the living, but Phoebe finds herself attracted to Tommy Williams, one of the \"living impaired\" teens at her school."

Although the name of the book was taken from the home campaign supervised by Gygax and Kuntz based on Gygax's imagined Castle Greyhawk and the lands surrounding it, Greyhawk did not give any details of the castle or the campaign world; instead, it explained the rules that Gygax and Kuntz used in their home campaign, and introduced a number of character classes, spells, concepts and monsters used in all subsequent editions of D&D."

  "text" : "Gay Kids – Kule barn som også finnes (2008) (\"Gay Kids – Cool children who also exist\") is a non-fiction Norwegian book that attempts to educate children about homosexual love. Gay Kids was released on November 6, 2008, and an exhibition of the book's photographic material was on display outside the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo. Originally scheduled through January 2009, the exhibit remained through July, an extra six months. The exhibition was inaugurated by gay politician and former Finance Minister of Norway Per Kristian Foss who also has provided a photo of himself as a 9-year-old boy for the book. Other celebrities such as pioneering Norwegian gay activist Kim Friele, chairman of Oslo's city government, Erling Lae and chief editor of Dagbladet, Anne Aasheim have also contributed with photographs for the book, altogether more than 100 lesbian, bisexual and gay people have contributed with their childhood photos. The book, in part based on the research done at the Norwegian Social Research institute, was originally intended to be an art project to describe the childhoods of gay men and women before their homosexual identities were in place., and it has been partially funded by grants from the Ministry of Children and Equality and the Fritt Ord foundation and it is also sponsored by Gay & Lesbian Health Norway along with several other organizations. Coauthor Angeltvedt stated at the book's release that he would like to see it become a textbook in Norway's elementary schools. In a November 6, 2008 interview with Minister of Education Bård Vegard Solhjell it reads that the book will be made available in elementary schools and that \"the book will be adapted to the teaching plan goals which address sexual orientation and diversity of family forms up and through the 7th grade.\""

Four were added to the book in the 1939 edition, about Lord Fisher, Charles Stewart Parnell, Lord Baden-Powell and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1941 the essays on Boris Savinkov and Leon Trotsky were removed from editions published at that time, since they had been opponents of Joseph Stalin, who as leader of Russia was now officially an ally of Britain against Germany in World War II, and the article on Roosevelt was removed in 1942 when America also became officially an ally of Britain with Roosevelt as president. The Odhams edition of 1947 reinstated the three essays after the war. Other subjects of the essays were Earl of Rosebery, Kaiser Wilhelm II, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Chamberlain, Sir John French, John Morley, Hindenburg, H. H. Asquith, Lawrence of Arabia, the Earl of Birkenhead, Marshal Foch, Alfonso XIII, Douglas Haig, Arthur James Balfour, Adolf Hitler, George Nathaniel Curzon, Philip Snowden, Georges Clemenceau, and George V."

  "text" : "According to the memoir, Pearson says her life was turned around upon learning in prison that a close friend and drug dealer, whom she called \"Uncle\", was killed. Pearson said of her decision to write her book, \"I just want to let people know where I came from ... to share my story. I know the Lord has blessed me. He gave me the power just to tell this story.\" The book also depicts the difficulty with which Pearson attempts to adjust to life after prison; she is fired from two jobs due to her criminal background, which drives her to return temporarily to drug dealing. During an interview about the book, she said, \"Every time I turned around, they kept firing me, so where else could I turn to? The streets never let you down. That's sad to say, but what (was) I supposed to be, starving? Go to a shelter?\" Pearson said she wrote the book, \"so that I won't have to keep explaining\" her past and her life story. She also said she hoped she could set an example for others in her situation: \"(It's) just to let people know you can make it through your trials and tribulations. ... You can make it out of it.\" The title refers to a religious awakening Pearson had after midnight one particular night in the Jessup prison, but she also said the word \"Midnight\" represents her previous life, and the word \"Grace\" represents her new life. Pearson was giving a book tour for Grace After Midnight while the fifth season of The Wire was being aired. Pearson said, \"People really take this show to heart.\" In the book, Pearson also describes how she used her real-life experiences in her acting performances. Specifically, she said she used to help her grandfather fix houses, which helped inspire her performance in the scene which opened The Wire's fourth season, in which she purchases a nail-gun that would be used to help conceal her murders."

The title was originally conceived of as \"The Bizarre.\" It was changed by the publisher to the more generic and 'safer' Great Science Fiction. There was concern about possible censorship at the time. Bizarre was an adjective often used in sex ads and the publisher also published The National Insider which ran personal ads. Clearly the word bizarre was not one that could be used in a personal ad. The stories by some of the top writers that I had encountered at the time (early '60s) lived up to my original title."

  "text" : "Gears of War is a video game franchise created and originally owned by Epic Games, developed and managed by The Coalition, and owned and published by Microsoft Studios. The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent & the Swarm. The franchise consists of four third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), continued Fenix and humanity’s ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released Gears of War: Judgment, a prequel to the series’ first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. The series' third sequel, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles new foes that threaten humanity. Gears of War was developed by Epic Games. Cliff Bleszinski, who has previously worked on Epic’s Unreal Tournament games, served the series’ lead game designer for the first three installments. He was inspired by gameplay elements from Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Bionic Commando. The series was also guided by Rod Fergusson, the executive producer and director of development of Epic Games until 2012. All four installments of the Gears of War series used a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 engine. On January 27, 2014, Microsoft acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games. Canadian studio The Coalition developed Gears of War 4, was released on October 11, 2016 for the Xbox One and Windows 10. Gears of War became one of the best-selling franchises for the Xbox 360. The series is well known for its emphasis on cover-based combat, in which players can use objects to avoid gunfire or safely engage enemies. All four installments in Gears of War featured several multiplayer modes that allowed players to compete against each other or team-up to battle AI opponents on Xbox Live. The Gears of War games have been amongst the most popular and most played titles on Xbox Live."

  "text" : "Goodbye Soldier is Spike Milligan's sixth volume of autobiography. World War II has ended, Milligan continues NAAFI performances. During this time in Italy and Austria he tours with a large group as one of The Bill Hall Trio. While music and war were backdrops for the first books, music and his relationship with Toni Fontana are here. (A relationship described in longings using tourist-guide Italian, and a repetitive fascination with being called “Terr-ee”.) The book covers June to September 1946, at which point Milligan is released from service and sails home for England. The text is a fifth shorter than the longest volume Mussolini: His Part in My Downfall. The jokes are sometimes sparse. Unlike the people he occasionally performed with during the war, with whom Milligan later worked or who otherwise became notable, Milligan spends a page suggesting the NAAFI tour group were “bloody awful”, and that “...none of them were ever heard of again”. (p. 111) But he says of Bill Hall: ”God, what a strange man, but a genius of a musician. When he died a few years ago, I realized that a genius could die unsung.” (p. 37) Italian ballerina Toni Fontana, a member of the group, is Milligan’s almost exclusive love interest. Milligan’s Italian is weak, her English is better, but not always up to Milligan’s verbal horseplay. Jokes need to be explained. Beyond reflections on how wonderful Milligan is, that it’s too hot, or too crowded, her opinions are little described — she says that Mussolini “was not a bad man, just stupid”. ”Were we sure we were in love? The answer seemed to be yes. So, what do we do? Do we get engaged? I think if I had asked her, she would have said yes.” (p. 109) (Milligan “...frequently said she was the love of his life. And they used to meet in Paris right up to the time he became too frail to travel.”) When not with Toni, Milligan plays or listens to music, or reads. “…we retire to my room for two hours and play those jazz standards I still love, ‘Georgia Brown’, ‘Poor Butterfly’, ‘What’s New’, ‘Sophisticated Lady’” (p. 30). There is music on the long bus trips between gigs. ”Hall produces his violin and plays Italian melodies. The Italians join in. I know this all may sound repetitive, but that’s how it was. We were all very repetitive.” (p. 161) Milligan amplifies on a theme from \"Rommel?\" \"Gunner Who?\" — the effect of popular culture on his life expectations: ”For me, the real world didn’t exist, so I grew up emotionally deformed....I was still wrapped up in the aura of the last film I had seen....The tram, the fog-ridden cold morning outside were all imaginary. They would all disappear when I saw my next Bing Crosby film. Most of my middle life would be spent trying to escape from their cloying influence....It wasn’t until I saw The Grapes of Wrath that I saw a real film.” (p. 189) As with earlier volumes, it is not always clear what is contrived. Illustratively, Milligan quotes two diary sentences, then expands them into a page of description (pp. 268-9). Other inserts are definitely contrived, such as quoting Hitler, “'You see, you Russian fools? Zey are already starting to like back us Germans!'” (p. 100)."

  "text" : "Guardians of Liberty is a three volume set of books published in 1943 by Bishop Alma Bridwell White, author of over 35 books and founder of the Pillar of Fire Church. Guardians of Liberty is primarily devoted to summarizing White’s vehement anti-Catholicism under the guise of patriotism. White also defends her historical support of and association with the Ku Klux Klan while significantly but not completely distancing herself from the Klan. Each of the three volumes corresponds to one of the three books White published in the 1920s promoting the Ku Klux Klan and her political views which in addition to anti-Catholicism also included nativism, anti-Semitism and white supremacy. In Guardians of Liberty, White removed most, but not all of the direct references to the Klan that had existed in her three 1920s books, both in the text and in the illustrations. In Volumes I and II, she removed most of the nativist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist ideology that had appeared in her predecessor books. However, in Guardians Volume III, she did retain edited versions of chapters promoting nativism, anti-Semitism and white supremecy. Like their predecessor books, each of the volumes is primarily a compendium of essays and sermons written by White and of illustrations by Reverend Branford Clarke. Most of the text and illustrations had originally been published in the pro-Ku Klux Klan political periodical The Good Citizen, one of the numerous periodicals published by the Pillar of Fire Church at their communal headquarters in Zarephath, New Jersey. The Pillar of Fire ceased publication of The Good Citizen in 1933. Guardians was published when White was 81 years old, three years before her death, and one year before the second Ku Klux Klan declared bankruptcy."

  "text" : "Gears of War is a video game franchise created and originally owned by Epic Games, developed and managed by The Coalition, and owned and published by Microsoft Studios. The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent & the Swarm. The franchise consists of four third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), continued Fenix and humanity’s ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released Gears of War: Judgment, a prequel to the series’ first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. The series' third sequel, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles new foes that threaten humanity. Gears of War was developed by Epic Games. Cliff Bleszinski, who has previously worked on Epic’s Unreal Tournament games, served the series’ lead game designer for the first three installments. He was inspired by gameplay elements from Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Bionic Commando. The series was also guided by Rod Fergusson, the executive producer and director of development of Epic Games until 2012. All four installments of the Gears of War series used a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 engine. On January 27, 2014, Microsoft acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games. Canadian studio The Coalition developed Gears of War 4, was released on October 11, 2016 for the Xbox One and Windows 10. Gears of War became one of the best-selling franchises for the Xbox 360. The series is well known for its emphasis on cover-based combat, in which players can use objects to avoid gunfire or safely engage enemies. All four installments in Gears of War featured several multiplayer modes that allowed players to compete against each other or team-up to battle AI opponents on Xbox Live. The Gears of War games have been amongst the most popular and most played titles on Xbox Live."

Chris Abani depicts the poverty and violence in Lagos and how it affects the everyday lives of Elvis and his family. Having emigrated from Nigeria himself as a result of the Biafran War, Abani’s novel touches on many issues relevant to corruption, poverty, and violence within the country. Elvis's story also touches on issues related to globalization, and how Nigeria's impoverished communities are affected by this phenomenon. The main focus of this story is on Elvis and how he survives in the often harsh environment that is Nigeria’s largest city; Elvis himself is a complex and sympathetic character who clearly cares for his family despite a turbulent upbringing. However, this is complicated by the numerous illegal and morally questionable jobs he takes part in with his friend Redemption."

Murphy was inspired to write the book after his time at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He became interested in the similarities between descriptions of successful athletes and people who said they had achieved the state of Zen. The novel spawned the Shivas Irons Society, an organization whose members combine golf and meditation. In 1997, Murphy wrote a sequel, The Kingdom of Shivas Irons. Golf in the Kingdom is referenced in the fifth episode of season one of the television series Franklin & Bash."

  "text" : "Gladys in Grammarland is a novel by Audrey Mayhew Allen, written ca. 1897 and published by the Roxburghe Press of Westminster. It is an educational imitation of Lewis Carroll's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In this story, Gladys becomes sleepy after class and finds that a Verb Fairy has taken an interest in her education. She is taken, through a cardboard door with \"English Grammar\" written on it, into Grammarland, where she meets with a great many Verbs, who explain the concepts of transitivity and intransitivity to her. She is tried at court and for using bad grammar, and imprisoned, where she studies some grammar. At length she is released and tried to mediate a dispute between King Proper Noun and King Common Noun. Gladys in Grammarland is one of a class of books called a \"didactic imitation\" by Carolyn Sigler. Audrey Mayhew Allen was born in 1870, and so was about 27 years of age when she wrote Gladys in Grammarland. She was the granddaughter of Henry Mayhew, one of the two founders (1841) of the satirical and humorous magazine Punch, and of Douglas William Jerrold, a dramatist and writer. The book features a number of line-drawings by an artist credited as \"Claudine\"."

It focused on both the physical and human geography features of the European continent and especially on Southeastern Europe, and is considered one of the most remarkable works of the modern Greek Enlightenment. The authors of the Geographia Neoteriki adopted new geographical methodologies for that time, which were primarily based on personal examination of the described areas and used as sources a number of contemporary European handbooks. The work, written in a vernacular language, also described the contemporary social developments and expressed ideas that were considered revolutionary and anticlerical, and addressed the political and economic decay of the Ottoman Empire. Geographia Neoteriki was welcomed with enthusiasm by western intellectual circles, especially in France, but on the other hand, it was largely neglected by Greek scholars."

  "text" : "Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America is a 2010 book by the political journalist Matt Taibbi about the events that led to the financial crisis of 2008. It argues that the crisis was not an accident of the free market but the result of a complex and ongoing politico-financial process taking place in the United States whereby wealth and power is transferred to a super-rich \"grifter class\" that holds a grip on the political process. The book has been described as a \"necessary ... corrective\" of the assertion that bubbles are inevitable in the market system, and contests the notion that the greed of the American consumer was a primary cause of the problem. Taibbi maintains that “all of us, conservatives and progressives, are being bled dry by a tiny oligarchy of extremely clever criminals and their castrato henchmen in government.”"

  "text" : "The Grammata Serica Recensa is a dictionary of Old Chinese published by the Swedish sinologist Bernard Karlgren in 1957. Bernard Karlgren made fundamental contributions to the study of the phonology of Middle and Old Chinese, which he called Ancient and Archaic Chinese respectively.In the course of his study of the sound system of Old Chinese, Karlgren focused on the clues provided by phono-semantic compound characters.His \"homorganic principle\", that the initials of characters sharing a phonetic component had a common point of articulation, has been central to subsequent studies of Old Chinese.In 1923 he published his Analytic dictionary of Middle Chinese, grouping characters by phonetic series and drawing inferences about Old Chinese sounds.An expanded dictionary including Karlgren's reconstructions in Old Chinese, the Grammata Serica, appeared in 1940.An extensive revision, the Grammata Serica Recensa appeared in 1957, including the results of Karlgren's studies of pre-Han texts, as well as indicating tones, which were omitted in the first version. Although Karlgren's Old Chinese reconstructions have been superseded, his comprehensive dictionary remains a valuable reference for students of Old Chinese.As late as 1998 it was described as \"the only good Chinese–English dictionary of Classical Chinese\".Supplements to the GSR continue to appear, remedying such defects as the limited indexing and obsolete reconstructions.The Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus (STEDT) project uses an electronic form of the GSR and has donated a mapping to Unicode, which is now included in the Unicode dataset."

  "text" : "Go East, Young Man: The Early Years is a memoir written by United States Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. It describes his childhood and early adult life, ending with his appointment to the Court in 1939 at age 40. The title, a play on the famous American expression \"Go West, young man\", alludes to Douglas's upbringing in the Western United States – being uprooted often, eventually landing in Yakima, Washington – followed by his legal education and professional success in the Eastern United States. It was published by Random House in April 1974 and is 493 pages long. The work showcases a passion for the natural world and includes vivid descriptions of a young Douglas's time in the Western mountains, including such tales as spending a defenseless night with a friend on an isolated spit of land, convinced that a screeching cougar nearby was about to do away with both of them. While not covering Douglas's tenure on the court, the book does not shy away from expressing his opinions on matters political or otherwise. He also criticizes personal aspects of people by name, including John Foster Dulles. In preparation for the work, Douglas said he had spent time researching records of his family's past and visiting ancestral and familial locations in Nova Scotia and Minnesota. Upon publication, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times found the book to be \"a peculiar kind of autobiography\" that, while capturing the nature of its author, is characterized by \"a disjointedness between one paragraph and the next that [...] makes the book read as if it was the transcript of an interview with all the questions expunged\". Nat Hentoff, writing for The New York Times Book Review, viewed Go East, Young Man much more favorably, saying his writing both here and in his Court opinions features a high level of quality, wit, and persuasiveness, and that \"he makes this book so continually arresting that it reads like the kind of novel one wishes would not end.\" Jim Dinsmore of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \"Justice William O. Douglas has usually been a maverick and is part of an American tradition, which, in contrast to conformity, extols the virtues of individuality and diversity\" and called the memoir \"a major testament of our time.\" Go East, Young Man spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller List. It was published in a paperback edition by Dell's Delta Books division later in 1974, at the same length of 493 pages. The work was framed as the first part of the Autobiography of William O. Douglas, with the second part, The Court Years, 1939 to 1975, being published in 1980 after the author's death. Legal commentator Jeffrey Rosen later wrote that \"the norms for judicial memoirs were shattered\" by the two volumes and their openness towards expressing strong political viewpoints and criticizing others. Scholar Bruce Allen Murphy published a heavily-researched biography of Douglas in 2003, Wild Bill: The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas. In it, he wrote that Douglas had long falsified much of his early life, including the nature of his childhood illness, the economic suffering of his family, his military service during World War I, and his performance at Columbia Law School. James Ryerson, writing for The New York Times Book Review, accepted Murphy's conclusions and stated that, \"In his 1974 autobiography, Go East, Young Man, [Douglas] repeated many of these outright lies, introduced new ones and liberally embellished other key details of his life story.\" However, another scholar working on a Douglas biography, David J. Danelski, as well as some of Douglas's past associates, said that while Douglas may have exaggerated at times, Murphy's biography had not proven the worst such incidences."

It consists of 1008 songs in Sanskrit which are divided into seven Kāṇḍas (books), every Kāṇḍa being sub-divided into one or more Sargas (cantos). There are 28 cantos in all, and each canto consists of 36 songs. The songs of the epic are based on rhythms and tunes or Rāgas found in the folk music and classical music of India. In the epic, each song in sung by one or more characters of the Rāmāyaṇa or by the poet. The songs progressively narrate the Rāmāyaṇa via monologues, dialogues and multilogues. There are occasional Sanskrit verses between the songs, which take the narrative forward. A copy of the epic with a Hindi commentary by the poet was published by the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University, Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh. The book was released by the Sanskrit poet Abhirāja Rājendra Miśra at Chitarkuta on the Makara Saṅkrānti day of January 14, 2011."

Originally written because Wordsworth needed money, the first version was published in 1810 as anonymous text in a collection of engravings. The work is now best known from its expanded and updated 1835 fifth edition. According to Wordsworth biographer Stephen Gill:The Guide is multi-faceted. It is a guide, but it is also a prose-poem about light, shapes, and textures, about movement and stillness ... It is a paean to a way of life, but also a lament for the inevitability of its passing ... What holds this diversity together is the voice of complete authority, compounded from experience, intense observation, thought, and love."

  "text" : "Glaring Through Oblivion is a 2011 book of poetry written by Serj Tankian, the Armenian-American lead singer of the band System of a Down. It is his second book of poetry, after Cool Gardens (2002). Glaring Through Oblivion was published by HarperCollins Publishers and printed in China, and released on March 22, 2011. The book begins with a prose essay, written several days after the September 11 attacks, about how Tankian feared to speak his opinions because of threats against him and his band, after he had written an essay two days after the attacks in which he blamed United States foreign policy for terrorism. The prose ends with Serj promising \"I, myself, have vowed to never ever again hold my tongue.\" Some of the poems contain lyrics that ended up in some of his songs, although sometimes a bit modified. Some poems consist of only one line and do not have a title. The last poem in the book, \"Borders\", actually was to become a whole song on his second album Imperfect Harmonies; the song \"Borders Are...\" contains elements of that poem as well as from several poems from cool gardens."

  "text" : "Gears of War is a video game franchise created and originally owned by Epic Games, developed and managed by The Coalition, and owned and published by Microsoft Studios. The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent & the Swarm. The franchise consists of four third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), continued Fenix and humanity’s ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released Gears of War: Judgment, a prequel to the series’ first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. The series' third sequel, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles new foes that threaten humanity. Gears of War was developed by Epic Games. Cliff Bleszinski, who has previously worked on Epic’s Unreal Tournament games, served the series’ lead game designer for the first three installments. He was inspired by gameplay elements from Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Bionic Commando. The series was also guided by Rod Fergusson, the executive producer and director of development of Epic Games until 2012. All four installments of the Gears of War series used a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 engine. On January 27, 2014, Microsoft acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games. Canadian studio The Coalition developed Gears of War 4, was released on October 11, 2016 for the Xbox One and Windows 10. Gears of War became one of the best-selling franchises for the Xbox 360. The series is well known for its emphasis on cover-based combat, in which players can use objects to avoid gunfire or safely engage enemies. All four installments in Gears of War featured several multiplayer modes that allowed players to compete against each other or team-up to battle AI opponents on Xbox Live. The Gears of War games have been amongst the most popular and most played titles on Xbox Live."

  "text" : "A gladiator (Latin: gladiator, \"swordsman\", from gladius, \"sword\") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death. Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world. The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games. The gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of Christianity as state church of the Roman Empire in 380, although beast hunts (venationes) continued into the 6th century."

  "text" : "George Frost Kennan (February 16, 1904 – March 17, 2005) was an American diplomat and historian. He was known best as an advocate of a policy of containment of Soviet expansion during the Cold War on which he later reversed himself. He lectured widely and wrote scholarly histories of the relations between USSR and the United States. He was also one of the group of foreign policy elders known as \"The Wise Men\". During the late 1940s, his writings inspired the Truman Doctrine and the U.S. foreign policy of \"containing\" the Soviet Union. His \"Long Telegram\" from Moscow during 1946 and the subsequent 1947 article \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\" argued that the Soviet regime was inherently expansionist and that its influence had to be \"contained\" in areas of vital strategic importance to the United States. These texts provided justification for the Truman administration's new anti-Soviet policy. Kennan played a major role in the development of definitive Cold War programs and institutions, notably the Marshall Plan. Soon after his concepts had become U.S. policy, Kennan began to criticize the foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior to the end of 1948, Kennan became confident that positive dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State during 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments. During 1950, Kennan left the Department of State—except for two brief ambassadorial stints in Moscow and Yugoslavia—and became a realist critic of U.S. foreign policy. He continued to analyze international affairs as a faculty member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 until his death at age 101. He was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford."

In it, Reich proposed, based on his therapeutic experience and empirical studies, that orgastic potency should be used as a decisive criterion for mental health. Neurotic disorder, according to Reich, was always based on a more or less pronounced \"orgastic impotence\". According to Reich, if a man permanently unable to experience a \"complete orgasm\", it would cause a blockage of the libido, which would produce a variety of disorders. Reich saw the treatment goal of psychoanalytic treatment as the restoration of \"orgastic potency\". To achieve this objective, Reich further developed the psychoanalytic technique: first analysis of resistance, then character analysis, finally, to Vegetotherapy."

The story was first published in novel format in 2011 by Omnific Publishing, with further publishing rights to the series being purchased by Berkley Books. The work was first published on 4 September 2012, along with the second book in the series, Gabriel's Rapture. The series has been compared to Fifty Shades of Grey because both originated as Twilight fan fiction, with the International Business Times reporting that Gabriel's Inferno differs in that it bears \"few similarities to the story that inspired it\". The novel was originally published online as a Twilight fan fiction entitled The University of Edward Masen (Edward Masen being Edward Cullen's human name) under the pen name of Sebastien Robichaud. Gabriel's Inferno and its sequels appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list."

  "text" : "(For other uses, see Ginger (disambiguation).) Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or simply ginger, is widely used as a spice or a folk medicine. It is a herbaceous perennial which grows annual stems about a meter tall bearing narrow green leaves and yellow flowers. Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, to which also belong turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. Ginger originated in the tropical rainforest in Southern Asia. Although ginger no longer grows wild, it is thought to have originated on the Indian subcontinent. The ginger plants grown in India show the largest amount of genetic variation. The larger the number of genetic variations, the longer the plant is thought to have grown in that region. Ginger was exported to Europe via India in the first century AD as a result of the lucrative spice trade and was used extensively by the Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste."

  "text" : "Galactic Derelict is the second novel in The Time Traders series by Andre Norton. It was first published in 1959, and as of 2012, had been reprinted in eight editions (with cover changes only). It is part of Norton's Forerunner universe. Galactic Derelict continues the series’ premise, an encounter between Western heroes and a mysterious alien race that has used time travel to alter Earth. This novel shifts between present day and the time of Folsom Man, some 10,000 years ago. Kirkus Reviews comments for this novel “Andre Norton has no peer in his (sic) chosen field of science fiction for teenagers…[here] there’s a hint of racial antagonism.” (The novel has pointed comments about racism against American Indians.)"

Garga Horā is written in the Sanskrit Sutra – format and from this work Varāhamihira has drawn profusely. Incidentally, both, Garga and Varāhamihira, have in their respective works referred to the proficiencies of the Greeks in the field of Astronomy. Parāśara is considered to be most ancient of Hindu astronomers, and second in order of time is Garga, whom Gauranga Nath Bannerjee, while agreeing with Dr.Kern, places in the 1st Century B.C. Bala Bhadra, the author of Horā Ratnaṁ, and whose method is considered to be more authoritative in South India was greatly influenced by Garga."

  "text" : "Gone Girl is a thriller novel by the writer Gillian Flynn. It was published by Crown Publishing Group in June 2012. The novel soon made the New York Times Best Seller list. The novel's suspense comes from the main character, Nick Dunne, and whether he is involved in the disappearance of his wife. In several interviews, Flynn has said that she was interested in exploring the psychology and dynamics of a long-term relationship. In portraying her principal characters who are out-of-work writers, she made use of her own experience being laid off from her job as a writer for Entertainment Weekly. Critics in the United States positively received and reviewed the novel. Reviewers praised the novel's use of unreliable narration, plot twists, and suspense. A film adaptation, directed by David Fincher and written by Flynn, with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike starring, was released on October 3, 2014. The film was met with both commercial success and widespread critical acclaim."

Not that it seems that way when you’re reading it. Balancing a multi-stranded plot, different exotic locales and a huge cast of characters, Hamilton plunges us straight into a murder mystery set in a near-future Newcastle, a city now adjacent to a portal to another world, the tropical St Libra.\""

  "text" : "Gods' Man is a wordless novel by American artist Lynd Ward (1905–1985) published in 1929. In 139 captionless woodblock prints it tells the Faustian story of an artist who signs away his soul for a magic paintbrush. Gods' Man was the first American wordless novel, and is seen as a precursor of, and influence on, the development of the graphic novel. Ward first encountered the wordless novel with Frans Masereel's The Sun (1919) while studying art in Germany in 1926. He returned to the United States in 1927 and established a career for himself as an illustrator. He found Otto Nückel's wordless novel Destiny (1926) in New York City in 1929, and it inspired him to create such a work of his own. Gods' Man appeared a week before the Wall Street Crash of 1929; it nevertheless enjoyed strong sales and remains the best-selling American wordless novel. Its success inspired other Americans to experiment with the medium, including cartoonist Milt Gross, who parodied Gods' Man in He Done Her Wrong (1930). In the 1970s Ward's example inspired cartoonists Art Spiegelman and Will Eisner to create their first graphic novels."

  "text" : "God in the Age of Science?: A Critique of Religious Reason is a 2012 book by the Dutch philosopher Herman Philipse, written in English and published in the United Kingdom. Philipse found his Atheist Manifesto (1995) to be too hastily and superficially written, and decided to set up a more complete work to systematically refute all the arguments for the existence of God epistemologically and to settle accounts with any reason to adhere to any form of theism. To gain insight in how a religious person substantiates the existence of God, Philipse presents a \"religious decision tree\" in God in the Age of Science?, that works thus: I  Is the statement \"God exists\" a factual truthclaim? a) yes; b) no. II  If yes (a), is it necessary to invoke any kind of (logical) argumentation or (empirical) evidence to back up this truthclaim? c) yes; d) no. III  If yes (c), does this argumentation or evidence need to be scientific in nature (to have gone through the scientific method), and is there no possibility to completely achieve a proof of God through one's own standards? e) yes; f) no. This leads to four categories of thinking about the existence of God(or gods): 1.  \n*  In the case of b), somebody claims that God does not factually exists, but is merely a metaphor. Defenders of this position are, according to Philipse, following the tradition of Wittgenstein, and are currently represented by people like D.Z. Phillips and Karen Armstrong. 2.  \n*  In the case of d), somebody claims that God factually exists, but that one may assert this without invoking any kind of argumentation or evidence. Alvin Plantinga is among those defending this position, aiming to explain the world in the case God exists, which itself remains a matter of faith. 3.  \n*  In the case of e), somebody claims that God factually exists, and that his existence can be demonstrated using scientific evidence. This position is held by people like Richard Swinburne and Stephen D. Unwin, who, for example, try to show the probability of God's existence using Bayes' theorem. Especially in the United States, the intelligent design movement (ID) was active from 1987 until 2005, claiming to possess scientific evidence for a divine creation instead of the theory of evolution, but ID was defeated in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial. Aside from ID, there are many other creationist movements with scientific pretences. 4.  \n*  In the case of f), somebody claims that God factually exists, and that one can prove this, but not in a scientific manner. Although himself an agnostic, the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould described this point of view as non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA): science and religion are two entirely different enterprises and have nothing to say about each other; therefore, the existence of God is a purely religious issue, which science has nothing to do with. The opposite of this is the god of the gaps argument, namely that if science can't explain any given phenomenon, religion can, often by postulating a god. Defenders of this position make use of what Philipse calls \"typically religious arguments\", such as revelation, religious texts, religious experience, prayer, speaking in tongues, a convulsion with foam at the mouth etc. Next, Philipse tries to refute arguments from every category step by step, but especially the e) case, namely Bayes' theorem as used by Swinburne. He concludes that 1) theism cannot be expressed in a meaningful way;2) if theism were meaningful, it would have no predictive power regarding the existing evidence, wherefore Bayesian arguments can't get started; and 3) if the Bayesian cumulative case strategy did work, one should conclude that atheism is more probable than theism."

The work is divided in seven cantos (Sargas), and verses are composed in the Doha and free metre. The protagonist of the poem is Hemu Vikramaditya (also known as Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, Hemu Bakkal) (1501–6 November 1556), last Hindu emperor of India, who re-established Hindu Kingdom in North India after over 350 years of foreign rule. But due to the prejudicial writing of Indian history by pro-Mughal historians, his achievements were belittled during the glorification of Mughal rulers and hence he remained unknown. The poem brings Hemu's patriotism, prowess and mettle to fore portraying the major events of his life including the battles with Afghan rebels and Mughal army, his coronation (rajyabhishek) on the throne of Delhi, his defeat in Second Battle of Panipat and his brutal decapitation by Bairam Khan. A copy of the poem was published by Aseem Publication, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The book was released in December 2011."

He further suggests that a stage of this evolution was the telling of gossip, an argument supported by the observation that language is adapted for storytelling. The book has been criticised on the grounds that since words are so cheap, Dunbar's \"vocal grooming\" would fail to represent an honest signal. Further, the book's theory fails to explain how meaningless vocal grooming sounds might become syntactical speech."

The American Mercury wrote in its review: \"There are, here and there, some ingenious and amusing passages, but in the main the ideas are not striking, nor is their exposition very impressive.

The novel is partially autobiographical. Drieu La Rochelle himself considered it to be his greatest book."

In fact, you'd think I was the Virgin Mary from this book so far — but that doesn't mean there's not juicy parts in it. It's just juicy parts about me, not other people.\" It is the second publication by Love, following Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love (2006), which was a scrapbook-style compilation of diary entries and photographs. In an April 2014 interview, Courtney stated that she has rejected the book suggesting it may not be released. In July, however, she said that the book was \"coming soon\"."

It entered Austrian military and police service by 1982 after it was the top performer on an exhaustive series of reliability and safety tests. Despite initial resistance from the market to accept a \"plastic gun\" due to durability and reliability concerns, and fears, (subsequently shown to be unfounded), that the pistol would be \"invisible\" to metal detectors in airports, Glock pistols have become the company's most profitable line of products, commanding 65% of the market share of handguns for United States law enforcement agencies, as well as supplying numerous national armed forces, security agencies, and police forces in at least 48 countries. Glocks are also popular firearms among civilians for recreational/competition shooting, home/self defense, and concealed or open carry."

  "text" : "Gun Control in the Third Reich is a non-fiction book from the Independent Institute that describes the gun control policies used in Germany from the 1918 Weimar Republic, through the Third Reich in 1938. The book aims to substantiate the Nazi gun control theory of gun politics in the United States by referencing German archives, diaries, and newspapers that attest to restrictions on firearm ownership for Jews and enemies of the state. The book is written by Stephen Halbrook, a lawyer who has argued and won three cases before the US Supreme Court and is well known for his involvement in Second Amendment and gun control litigation. In an interview in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Halbrook said that he decided to research the topic because \"Nobody has ever researched it. I first heard about it when I was an undergraduate in college in 1968, and there were these gun registration bills proposed in Congress. [...] The proponents of the bill challenged that and said they actually had commissioned a Library of Congress study saying there was no use of gun registration lists by the Nazis, either in Germany or in occupied countries, which was blatantly stupid. When (the Nazis) took power in 1933, they immediately used the (gun registration) records to disarm political enemies.\" In a November 2013 review of the book in The New Republic, senior editor Alec MacGillis said Halbrook told him that he wanted the book to be seen as a scholarly work. As for analogies between Nazi gun laws and today's gun control debates, Halbrook said: \"The Nazis thought it was really important to disarm political enemies and Jews, but as far as contemporary comparisons, I’m very aware of how loosely people use these comparisons, and it does a disservice to the victims of the Holocaust.\""

  "text" : "Gunner Cade is the second of two science fiction novels written by Cyril M. Kornbluth and Judith Merril (under their Cyril Judd pseudonym), originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in 1952. It was issued in hardcover by Simon & Schuster later that year, with an Ace Double paperback following in 1957. An Italian translation was serialized in Scienza Fantastica in 1953; a German translation was issued in 1958; and a French translation appeared in 1979. Gollancz issued a British hardcover in 1964, with a Penguin paperback following in 1966. The Science Fiction Book Club published an edition in 1965, with a Dell paperback appearing in 1969. Reprint editions (in various languages) continued to appear in the 1970s and 1980s. NESFA Press included the novel in a 2008 omnibus of Kornbluth and Merril novels, Spaced Out. Gunner Cade began as a synopsis, \"Time of Troubles\", written entirely by Kornbluth. The co-authors broke the story down into planned 5000-word segments, which they wrote alternately. \"Cyril would write what was supposed to be a five-thousand-word section in about three thousand words. I would then go back and rewrite his section to make it five thousand words\", Merril remembered. \"Then I would write the next five-thousand-word section in eight thousand words. He would rewrite my section to shorten it\". They completed the novel in six weeks, writing quickly because both were \"desperately broke\". The novel deals with the transformation of Cade, the title character, from a loyal member of the elite police force of an authoritarian interplanetary regime into an individualistic rebel. Kornbluth and Merril crafted the novel to appeal to Astounding editor John W. Campbell, using Fritz Leiber's Gather, Darkness! as their model. \"We did a really interesting analytical breakdown of what Campbell would and wouldn't buy\", Merril later wrote. \"The scientific stuff had to be there, but the sort of spiritual fantasy element had to be there as well. Also, the novel had to contain the sort of humor that made sense to Campbell\"."

The novel is largely autobiographical, Griffiths moved to Aberystwyth to research a PhD in post-war British poetry but soon became, as he puts it, an \"enthusiastic participator in parties\" and dropped out of his studies. Ianto, a character briefly appearing in Grits became the anti-hero of Griffith's second novel Sheepshagger."

  "text" : "Gandhi Before India is a 2013 book by the Indian historian Ramachandra Guha, the first part of a planned two-volume biography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The book deals with Gandhi's life up to his return to India following a 21-year period as a lawyer and civil-rights activist in South Africa. During this period in South Africa, Gandhi experienced discrimination that all coloured people there faced, including the Indian community he became a part of. In response to the government's policies developed Satyagraha, a form of protest that translates loosely to \"truth force\". Gandhi Before India was first published by Penguin India on 2 October 2013, Gandhi's birth anniversary. The book's title alludes to Guha's India After Gandhi (2007). Gandhi Before India was mostly well received by critics, both in the mainstream media and in scholarly journals."

  "text" : "Godolphin is a satirical 19th-century British romance novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It is about the life of an idealistic man, Percy Godolphin, and his eventual lover, Constance Vernon. Written as a frame narrative, Godolphin provides a satirical insight into the day-to-day lives of the early 19th-century British elite. The story is told through the narration of two protagonists, Percy Godolphin and Constance Vernon, as they rise to prominence among the London elite. Godolphin was published two years after The Reform Bill passed which put an end to the exclusive high class in England. Bulwer-Lytton, being a politician, was a member of this British elite. Literary scholar, William Cragg, reveals that the original novel published in 1833 was replaced in 1840 with a revised copy. Bulwer-Lytton received very harsh criticisms upon the novels original release due to its extremely harsh criticism of specific rival politicians and its appearance as a celebration of the Reform Bill."

  "text" : "Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (German: Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse) is a work of Sigmund Freud from the year 1921. In this monograph, Freud describes psychological mechanisms at work within mass movements. A mass, according to Freud, is a \"temporary entity, consisting of heterogeneous elements that have joined together for a moment.\" He refers heavily to the writings of sociologist and psychologist Gustave Le Bon (1841-1931), summarizing his work at the beginning of the book in the chapter Le Bons Schilderung der Massenseele (\"Le Bon's description of the group mind\"). Like Le Bon, Freud says that as part of the mass, the individual acquires a sense of infinite power which allows him to act on impulses that he would otherwise have to curb as an isolated individual. These feelings of power and security allow the individual not only to act as part of the mass, but also to feel safety in numbers. This is accompanied, however, by a loss of conscious personality and a tendency of the individual to be infected by any emotion within the mass, and to amplify the emotion, in turn, by \"mutual induction\". Overall, the mass is \"impulsive, changeable, and irritable. It is controlled almost exclusively by the unconscious.\" Freud distinguishes between two types of masses. One is the short-lived kind, characterized by a rapidly transient interest, such as trends. The other kind consists of more permanent and enduring masses, which are highly organized, such as the Church or the military. \"The masses of the former type, so to speak, ride on the latter, like the short but high waves on the long swell of the sea.\"  However, the same basic mental processes operate in both kinds of masses. Freud refers back to his theory of instincts and believes that masses are held together by libidinal bonds. Each individual in the mass acts on impulses of love that are diverted from their original objectives. They pursue no direct sexual goal, but \"do not therefore work less vigorously\". Freud initially called the (largely unconscious) identification with the other individuals of the mass, all of whom are drawn in the same way to the leader, a binding element. The ego perceives a significant similarity with others in the group and identifies with them. In addition, admiration and idealization of the leader of the group takes place through the process of idealization. The narcissistic libido is displaced to the object which is \"loved because of its perfection which the individual has sought for his own ego\". Also, a process of identification with the aggressor can take place, for example, as happens in regression. Thus, Freud came to the conclusion: \"A primary mass is a number of individuals who have put one and the same object in place of their ego ideal and consequently identify with each other.\""

Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the \"all-pervasive mass media\" and must fight to keep their capacity for contemplation. The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece. Artists detailed include Titian, Manet, Picasso, and Jackson Pollock among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Wall Street Journal, while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as The New York Times Book Review."

  "text" : "God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 book written by Alan Peshkin and published by the University of Chicago Press. It is the product of his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence. Reviewers wrote that Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his decision to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations. They also noted that the book filled a literary lacuna in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist Christian school."

  "text" : "Go Set a Watchman is a novel by Harper Lee published on July 14, 2015, by HarperCollins in the United States and Willam Heinemann in the United Kingdom. Although written before her first and only other published novel, the Pulitzer Prize-winning To Kill a Mockingbird—and initially promoted by its publisher as a sequel—it is now more widely accepted as being a first draft of the famous novel. The title comes from Isaiah 21:6: \"For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.\" It alludes to Jean Louise Finch's view of her father, Atticus Finch, as the moral compass (\"watchman\") of Maycomb, and has a theme of disillusionment, as she discovers the extent of the bigotry in her home community. The book's unexpected and controversial discovery, decades after it was written, together with the exceptional eminence of the author's only other book—an American classic—caused its publication to be highly anticipated; Amazon stated that it was their \"most pre-ordered book\" since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 2007, and stores arranged all-night openings from midnight to cope with expected demand. According to the publisher, Go Set a Watchman, \"...tackles the racial tensions brewing in the South in the 1950s and delves into the complex relationship between father and daughter.\" It includes versions of many of the characters who appear in To Kill a Mockingbird."
