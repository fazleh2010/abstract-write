  "text" : "[Date: 1601.] Conversation, as it was by the Social Fireside, in the Time of the Tudors. or simply 1601 is the title of a short risqué squib by Mark Twain, first published anonymously in 1880, and finally acknowledged by the author in 1906. Written as an extract from the diary of one of Queen Elizabeth I's ladies-in-waiting, the pamphlet purports to record a conversation between Elizabeth and several famous writers of the day. The topics discussed are entirely scatological, notably flatulence and sex. 1601 was, according to Edward Wagenknecht, \"the most famous piece of pornography in American literature.\" However, it was more ribaldry than pornography; its content was more in the nature of irreverent and vulgar comedic shock than obscenity for sexual arousal. Prior to the court decisions in the United States in 1959-1966 that legalized the publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover, Tropic of Cancer, and Fanny Hill, the piece continued to be considered unprintable, and was circulated clandestinely in privately printed limited editions."

  "text" : "1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them is a compendium of notable popular recordings collected by Australian rock journalist and critic Toby Creswell. The book was initially published in 2005 by Hardie Grant Books (Prahran, Victoria) and subsequently published in the United States by Thunder's Mouth Press (an imprint of the Avalon Publishing Group) in 2006. It is a very personal collection with quite an Australian bias, and some of the choices and comments are probably quite controversial. It is not a collection of songs, but of the stories behind what Creswell considers are the great songs of all time – from George Gershwin to Missy Elliott, from Bob Dylan to Alicia Keys, from Frank Sinatra to The Offspring, from Leonard Cohen to Pulp. The book also features over 400 photographs and album covers. 1001 Songs is used extensively by Brian Nankervis, creator, producer and adjudicator, of SBS program RocKwiz as a source of information for questions on the show. In the foreword to the book Creswell states the main research source was All Music Guide, which was consulted for release dates, songwriting credits and album listings, together with the website, Rock's Backpages. Creswell wrote his first article on rock & roll for Nation Review in 1972. He subsequently wrote articles about all aspects of popular culture and music for RAM, Billboard, Roadrunner and a range of national and international magazines and newspapers. He has worked for MTV and a variety of television programs as a writer and presenter. In 1985 he became editor of the Australian edition of Rolling Stone and two years later was in a partnership which took over the franchise. He continued to edit Rolling Stone until September 1992. He was a founding editor of Juice."

The work is considered a companion piece to McCullough's earlier biography of John Adams, and focuses on the events surrounding the start of the American Revolution. While revolving mostly around the leadership (and often indecisiveness) of George Washington, there is also considerable attention given to King George III, General Howe, Henry Knox, and Nathanael Greene. Key Revolutionary War battles detailed in the book include the Battle of Dorchester Heights, the Battle of Long Island, and the Battle of Trenton. The actual signing of the Declaration of Independence is treated as a somewhat minor detail, as the main focus of the book is on military rather than political events. The book includes multiple pages of full color illustrations, including portraits and historical battlefield maps made by British engineers at the time."

  "text" : "1633 is an alternate history novel co-written by Eric Flint and David Weber, and sequel to 1632 in the 1632 series. 1633 is the second major novel in the series and together with the anthology Ring of Fire, the two sequels begin the series hallmarks of being a shared universe with collaborative writing being very common, as well as one—far more unusual— which mixes many canonical anthologies with its works of novel length. This in part is because Flint wrote 1632 as a stand-alone novel, though with enough \"story hooks\" for an eventual sequel, and because Flint feels \"history is messy\", and the books reflect that real life is not a smooth polished linear narrative flow from the pen of some historian, but is instead clumps of semi-related or unrelated happenings that somehow sum together where different people act in their own self-interests."

Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Rick Santorum. The book received positive reception in Publishers Weekly and The Nation. Reference & Research Book News called the book \"the liberal polemical riposte\" of 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. The book includes quotes attributed to American radio host and conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh, without providing a date or details about the quotes. When Limbaugh was in dealings to purchase a portion of the American football team, the St. Louis Rams in 2009, the quotes were reported in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Limbaugh disputed the quotes. The author of the book and its publisher both declined to comment to Associated Press. Legal analysts told Fox News Channel that Limbaugh could have a case for a libel lawsuit."

  "text" : "12 Days is a debut graphic novel/global manga written and illustrated by June Kim. Basing the plot partially on a story told to her by a stranger, Kim began an early version of 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope with the end of a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death. Tokyopop published 12 Days in North America on 7 November 2006, to generally positive reviews. Critics praised the manga for its mature portrayal of grief and relationships, and its realistic artwork, although the choice of print for the dialogue was considered distracting. Reviewers also discussed the comic's treatment of the issues of love, loss, and lesbian elements. In May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American publishing branch, with the status of its original, global manga titles left unclear."

The book was edited by Robert Dimery, a writer and editor who had previously worked for magazines such as Time Out and Vogue. Each entry in the book's list of albums is accompanied by a short essay written by a music critic, along with pictures, quotes, and additional information (such as the album's running time and producer). Only albums consisting fully of original material by a particular artist were included, which meant that compilations by various artists, including film soundtracks, were also excluded. The most recent edition consists of a list of albums released between 1955 and 2013, part of a series from Quintessence Editions Ltd. The book is arranged chronologically, starting with Frank Sinatra's In the Wee Small Hours and the most recent edition concluding with The Next Day by David Bowie."

The diary, a true story based on her own life, was originally written in first person. It is about a girl coping with her teenage life along with a degenerative disease. She keeps a diary of not only what she does but how she feels and the hardships she must endure. Initially, the diary's purpose was for Kitō to chronicle impressions she had about how the disease was affecting her daily life. As the disease progressed, however, the diary became Kitō's outlet for describing the intense personal struggles she underwent in coping, adapting, and ultimately trying to survive her disease. As she notes in one entry, \"I write because writing is evidence that I am still alive.\""

The book focuses on Stephen Wyatt, a middle school inventor, who must overcome his inventor's block that developed when his parents reveal they are planning to have him skip eighth grade, leaving his friends behind in middle school when he goes off to high school. The idea for this novel came from Wardlaw's five years of experience as an elementary school educator. The novel was named on the Best Books of the Month list in ALAN, the journal of the National Council of Teachers of English. This book was also chosen as a Children's Choice for 2005."

Originally published in Spanish, the book was translated into English and republished in 2007 by British publisher Phaidon Press with the assistance of both Ortegas and artwork by Javier Mariscal. Though the original Spanish editions were sparsely illustrated, Alianza later adopted the Phaidon cover and artwork for newer editions. The book is written as a general kitchen reference for Spanish home cooks and therefore focuses heavily but not exclusively on Spanish cuisine; it therefore also lacks background material such as technical or historical commentary on many of the recipes."

First published by Yale University Press in 1981, it examines how a number of seemingly insignificant events in 1587 might have caused the downfall of the Ming empire. The Chinese title, meaning \"the fifteenth year of the Wanli era\", is how the year 1587 was expressed in the Chinese calendar: the era name of the reigning Chinese emperor at the time, followed by which year of his reign it was. Major figures discussed in the book besides the emperor are Grand Secretaries Zhang Juzheng and Shen Shixing, official Hai Rui, general Qi Jiguang and philosopher Li Zhi. Although Huang had completed the manuscript by 1976, no publisher would accept it at first, as it was not serious enough for an academic work, but was too serious for popular non-fiction. The work has been translated into a number of different languages: Chinese, Japanese, German and French."

In 2011, the book earned Gomes his third and fourth Jabuti Prizes, in the categories \"best reportage-book\" and \"non-fiction book of the year\"."

  "text" : "11/22/63 is a novel by Stephen King about a time traveler who attempts to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which occurred on November 22, 1963 (the novel's titular date). The novel was announced on King's official site on March 2, 2011. A short excerpt was released online on June 1, 2011, and another excerpt was published in the October 28, 2011, issue of Entertainment Weekly. The novel was published on November 8, 2011 and quickly became a number-one bestseller. It stayed on The New York Times Best Seller list for 16 weeks. 11/22/63 won the 2011 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Best Mystery/Thriller and the 2012 International Thriller Writers Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for the 2012 British Fantasy Award for Best Novel and the 2012 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. The novel required considerable research to accurately portray the late 1950s and early 1960s. King commented on the amount of research it required, saying \"I've never tried to write anything like this before. It was really strange at first, like breaking in a new pair of shoes.\" The novel was adapted into a 2016 Hulu television series, 11.22.63."

  "text" : "100 Cult Films is a 2011 book written by Ernest Mathijs and Xavier Mendik, who selected one hundred cult films to discuss. The two authors often disagreed with each other and were forced to make concessions; for example, Mathijs opposed the inclusion of Cannibal Holocaust, which he called an initiation ritual and not a film with a devoted cult following. He relented and allowed its inclusion so that he could convince Mendik to include Begotten. Mathijs wanted to include The Princess Bride, but Mendik preferred to focus on including more transgressive films, and it was not included. As a result of its necessarily arbitrary choices, the book attracted controversy from cult film fans. To choose the final film, the authors performed a public survey; the resulting winner was In Bruges. A mobile app was released to allow readers to mark each of the films that they have seen. The app features appearances by Eli Roth and Joe Dante."
