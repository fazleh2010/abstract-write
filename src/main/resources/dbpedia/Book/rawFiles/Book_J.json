  "text" : "Jane Eyre /ˈɛər/ (originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published on 16 October 1847, by Smith, Elder & Co. of London, England, under the pen name \"Currer Bell.\" The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Primarily of the Bildungsroman genre, Jane Eyre follows the emotions and experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester, the Byronic master of fictitious Thornfield Hall. In its internalisation of the action—the focus is on the gradual unfolding of Jane's moral and spiritual sensibility, and all the events are coloured by a heightened intensity that was previously the domain of poetry—Jane Eyre revolutionised the art of fiction. Charlotte Brontë has been called the 'first historian of the private consciousness' and the literary ancestor of writers like Joyce and Proust. The novel contains elements of social criticism, with a strong sense of morality at its core, but is nonetheless a novel many consider ahead of its time given the individualistic character of Jane and the novel's exploration of classism, sexuality, religion, and proto-feminism."

The duration of a job may range from an hour (in the case of odd jobs) to a lifetime (in the case of some judges).

  "text" : "Jack of Shadows is a novel combining elements of both science fiction and fantasy written by American author Roger Zelazny. According to him, the name of the book (but not the titular character) was an homage to Jack Vance. In his introduction to the novel he mentioned that he tried to capture some of the exotic landscapes so frequent in Vance's work. Zelazny wrote it in first draft, no rewrites. The novel was serialized in F&SF in 1971 and published in book form that same year. It was nominated for a 1972 Hugo Award and finished #4 in the 1972 Locus Poll for Best Novel. The text of the serialization and the published book are slightly different. A copy-editing error garbled a conversation between Jack and Morningstar in chapter 6; the correct version appeared in the original magazine appearance and has been reprinted on pages 511–512 of The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 3: This Mortal Mountain, NESFA Press, 2009."

Published in 1742 and defined by Fielding as a \"comic epic poem in prose\", it is the story of a good-natured footman's adventures on the road home from London with his friend and mentor, the absent-minded parson Abraham Adams. The novel represents the coming together of the two competing aesthetics of eighteenth-century literature: the mock-heroic and neoclassical (and, by extension, aristocratic) approach of Augustans such as Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift; and the popular, domestic prose fiction of novelists such as Daniel Defoe and Samuel Richardson. The novel draws on a variety of inspirations. Written \"in imitation of the manner of Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote\" (see title page on right), the work owes much of its humour to the techniques developed by Cervantes, and its subject-matter to the seemingly loose arrangement of events, digressions and lower-class characters to the genre of writing known as picaresque. In deference to the literary tastes and recurring tropes of the period, it relies on bawdy humour, an impending marriage and a mystery surrounding unknown parentage, but conversely is rich in philosophical digressions, classical erudition and social purpose."

  "text" : "Journey to the West is a Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng'en. It is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. In English-speaking countries, the work is widely known as Monkey, the title of Arthur Waley's popular abridged translation. The novel is an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage of the Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Xuanzang who traveled to the \"Western Regions\", that is, Central Asia and India, to obtain Buddhist sacred texts (sūtras) and returned after many trials and much suffering. It retains the broad outline of Xuanzang's own account, Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, but the Ming dynasty novel adds elements from folk tales and the author's invention, that is, that Gautama Buddha gave this task to the monk and provided him with three protectors who agree to help him as an atonement for their sins. These disciples are Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, together with a dragon prince who acts as Xuanzang's steed, a white horse. Journey to the West has strong roots in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology, Taoist and Buddhist philosophy, and the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas are still reflective of some Chinese religious attitudes today. Enduringly popular, the tale is at once a comic adventure story, a spring of spiritual insight, and an extended allegory in which the group of pilgrims journeys towards enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation."

  "text" : "Jay's Journal is a book presented as an autobiographical account of a depressed teenage boy who becomes involved with a Satanic group. After participating in several occult rituals, \"Jay\" believes he is being haunted by a demon named Raul. The book is based on \"true\" events of 16-year-old Alden Barrett from Pleasant Grove, Utah, who committed suicide in 1971. Some critics have challenged the authenticity of the story, noting that the editor of this book, Beatrice Sparks, has filled the same role on many other \"actual, anonymous diaries of teenagers\" that explore such sensational themes as drug addiction, teenage pregnancy, and prostitution. These books, the most well-known of which is Go Ask Alice, serve as cautionary tales. According to a book written by Barrett's brother Scott (A Place in the Sun: The Truth Behind Jay's Journal), and interviews with the family, Sparks used roughly 25 entries of 212 total from Barrett's actual journal. The other entries were fictional, based on case histories from other teenagers Sparks worked with, and interviews of friends and acquaintances of Barrett. A rock opera titled A Place in the Sun was created and performed by Utah country band Grain in 1997. According to some family members, it was a more accurate portrayal and showed Sparks' alleged exploitation of the story. Within the city of Pleasant Grove, Jay's Journal has been the source of many urban legends, including alleged locations where Jay performed actions described in the book, his home, the effect on his family after his death, and other rumors. Due to allegations of ritual cattle mutilation arising in Jay's Journal, the book came to the attention of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers investigating reports of killed and mutilated cows in Alberta."

  "text" : "Jin Ping Mei (Chinese: 金瓶梅; pinyin: Jīn Píng Méi) — translated into English as The Plum in the Golden Vase or The Golden Lotus — is a Chinese novel of manners composed in vernacular Chinese during the late Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The author took the pseudonym Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng (蘭陵笑笑生), \"The Scoffing Scholar of Lanling,\" and his identity is otherwise unknown (the only clue being that he hailed from Lanling County in present-day Shandong). The novel circulated in manuscript as early as 1596, and may have undergone revision up to its first printed edition in 1610. The most widely read recension, edited and published with commentaries by Zhang Zhupo in 1695, unfortunately deleted or rewrote passages important in understanding the author's intentions. The explicit depiction of sexuality garnered the novel a notoriety akin to Fanny Hill and Lolita in English literature, but critics such as the translator David Tod Roy see a firm moral structure which exacts retribution for the sexual libertinism of the central characters. Jin Ping Mei takes its name from the three central female characters — Pan Jinlian (潘金蓮, whose given name means \"Golden Lotus\"); Li Ping'er (李瓶兒, given name literally means, \"Little Vase\"), a concubine of Ximen Qing; and Pang Chunmei (龐春梅, \"Spring plum blossoms\"), a young maid who rose to power within the family. Chinese critics see each of the three Chinese characters in the title as symbolizing an aspect of human nature, such as mei (梅), plum blossoms, being metaphoric for sexuality. Princeton University Press, in describing the Roy translation, calls the novel \"a landmark in the development of the narrative art form – not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but in a world-historical context...noted for its surprisingly modern technique\" and \"with the possible exception of The Tale of Genji (c. 1010) and Don Quixote (1605, 1615), there is no earlier work of prose fiction of equal sophistication in world literature.\""

  "text" : "Jennifer Government is a novel written by Max Barry. Published in 2003, it is Barry's second novel, following 1999's Syrup. The novel is set in a dystopian alternate reality in which most nations (now controlled by the United States) are dominated by for-profit corporate entities while the government's political power is extremely limited. Some readers consider it similar in satiric intent to George Orwell's 1984, but of a world with too little political power as opposed to too much. Consequently, the novel can be seen as a criticism of right-libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism. Many readers also see it as a criticism of globalization, although Barry claims he is not an anti-globalist. He has created a game based on the novel: Jennifer Government: NationStates. The novel was titled Logoland for the German and Italian editions. The Brazilian edition was titled EU S/A, translated as Me, Inc., but can be seen as an abbreviation of Estados Unidos Sociedade Anônima, which roughly translates to United States, Inc. in English."

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings by Barbara Strachey is an atlas based on the fictional realm of Middle-earth, which traces the journeys undertaken by the characters in Tolkien's epic. The book comprises 51 two-colour maps (a general map of Middle-earth and 50 numbered maps) at various scales, all based on the original The Lord of the Rings maps drawn by Christopher Tolkien from his father's sketches. Each map is on a right-hand page in landscape format and depicts physical features in black and contour lines in red. Routes taken by characters on roads and paths are shown in dashed black and red; routes off-road are in red only. Arrows show the direction of travel and dates are listed in red. Scales along the top and left of each map show the distance east/west (mainly east) and north/south (mainly south) from Bag End. At the bottom of each map is a scale showing miles to the inch and an indication of the lunar phase or phases visible at the dates given. Each numbered map is accompanied by a description on the facing left-hand page, in which Strachey describes the portion of the route indicated, often justifying her topographical decisions with quotes from the book. In some cases she points out discrepancies in the topographical descriptions, occasionally for instance altering the course of a road or a river on the grounds that it would otherwise be inconsistent with Tolkien's other descriptions of the terrain. Christopher Tolkien refers to Journeys of Frodo a number of times in The History of The Lord of the Rings, often agreeing with Strachey's conclusions, and sometimes disagreeing."

  "text" : "Juliette is a novel written by the Marquis de Sade and published 1797–1801, accompanying Sade's Nouvelle Justine. While Justine, Juliette's sister, was a virtuous woman who consequently encountered nothing but despair and abuse, Juliette is an amoral nymphomaniac murderer who is successful and happy. The full title of the novel in the original French is Histoire de Juliette ou les Prospérités du vice, and the English title is \"Juliette, or Vice Amply Rewarded\" (versus \"Justine; or Good Conduct Well-Chastised\", considered to be the prequel of Juliette). As many other of his works, Juliette follows a pattern of violently pornographic scenes followed by long treatises on a broad range of philosophical topics, including theology, morality, aesthetics, naturalism and also Sade's dark, fatalistic view of world metaphysics."

  "text" : "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈtɒlkiːn/; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009."

The story involves German professor Otto Lidenbrock who believes there are volcanic tubes going toward the centre of the Earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans descend into the Icelandic volcano Snæfellsjökull, encountering many adventures, including prehistoric animals and natural hazards, before eventually coming to the surface again in southern Italy, at the Stromboli volcano. The genre of subterranean fiction already existed long before Verne. However, the present book considerably added to its popularity and influenced later such writings. For example, Edgar Rice Burroughs explicitly acknowledged Verne's influence on his own Pellucidar series."

  "text" : "James and the Giant Peach is a popular children's novel  written in 1961 by British author Roald Dahl. The original first edition published by Alfred Knopf featured illustrations by Nancy Ekholm Burkert. There have been reillustrated versions of it over the years, done by Michael Simeon for the first British edition, Emma Chichester Clark, Lane Smith and Quentin Blake. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1996. The plot centres on a young English orphan boy who enters a gigantic, magical peach, and has a wild and surreal cross-world adventure with seven magically-altered garden bugs he meets. They set off on a journey to escape from James' two mean and cruel aunts. Roald Dahl was originally going to write about a giant cherry, but changed it to James and the Giant Peach because a peach is \"prettier, bigger and squishier than a cherry.\" Because of the story's occasional macabre and potentially frightening content, it has become a regular target of the censors and is No. 56 on the American Library Association's top 100 list of most frequently challenged books. The actors Jeremy Irons, Andrew Sachs, and Julian Rhind-Tutt provide the English language audiobook recordings."

  "text" : "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is the 2004 debut novel of British writer Susanna Clarke. An alternative history set in 19th-century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars, it is based on the premise that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Centred on the relationship between these two men, the novel investigates the nature of \"Englishness\" and the boundaries between reason and unreason, Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Dane, and Northern and Southern English cultural tropes/stereotypes. It has been described as a fantasy novel, an alternative history, and a historical novel. It inverts the Industrial Revolution conception of the North-South divide in England: in this book the North is romantic and magical, rather than rational and concrete. The narrative draws on various Romantic literary traditions, such as the comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's language is a pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, such as those of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship. Clarke began writing Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in 1992; ten years later she submitted the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury were so sure of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best-seller list. It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel."

  "text" : "In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus (/ˈdʒeɪnəs/; Latin: Ianus, pronounced [ˈjaː.nus]) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, doorways, passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past. It is conventionally thought that the month of January is named for Janus (Ianuarius), but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs Juno was the tutelary deity of the month. Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. The doors of his temple were open in time of war, and closed to mark the peace. As a god of transitions, he had functions pertaining to birth and to journeys and exchange, and in his association with Portunus, a similar harbor and gateway god, he was concerned with travelling, trading and shipping. Janus had no flamen or specialised priest (sacerdos) assigned to him, but the King of the Sacred Rites (rex sacrorum) himself carried out his ceremonies. Janus had a ubiquitous presence in religious ceremonies throughout the year, and was ritually invoked at the beginning of each one, regardless of the main deity honored on any particular occasion. The ancient Greeks had no equivalent to Janus, whom the Romans claimed as distinctively their own."

  "text" : "Johnny Tremain is a 1943 children's fiction historical novel by Esther Forbes set in Boston prior to and during the outbreak of the American Revolution. Intended for teen-aged readers, the novel's themes include apprenticeship, courtship, sacrifice, human rights, and the growing tension between Patriots and Loyalists as conflict nears. Events described in the novel include the Boston Tea Party, the British blockade of the Port of Boston, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The book won the 1944 Newbery Medal and is the 16th bestselling children's book as of the year 2000 in the United States, according to Publishers Weekly. In 1957, Walt Disney Pictures released a film adaptation, also called Johnny Tremain. Another Johnny Tremaine - note the different spelling of the surname - was a historical fictional character played by Rod Cameron in the 1949 Republic Pictures movie Brimestone, written by Thames Williamson and Norman S. Hall. This Johnny Tremaine was a U.S. Marshall who goes undercover to stop a cattle smuggling ring. This movie followed the awarding of the Newbery prize, but preceded the 1957 movie based on a Disneyfied version of Forbes's book."

  "text" : "Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name \"Jack the Ripper\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax, and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The killer was called \"the Whitechapel Murderer\" as well as \"Leather Apron\" within the crime case files, as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer. The \"From Hell\" letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as \"Jack the Ripper\", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events. Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper, and his legend solidified. A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims—Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly—are known as the \"canonical five\" and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked. The murders were never solved, and the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research, folklore, and pseudohistory. The term \"ripperology\" was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases. There are now over one hundred theories about the Ripper's identity, and the murders have inspired many works of fiction."

  "text" : "The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2017, there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\"."

The majority of the narrative takes place in Harlem during the 1920s; however, as the pasts of the various characters are explored, the narrative extends back to the mid-19th century American South. The novel forms the second part of Morrison's Dantesque trilogy on African American history, beginning with Beloved and ending with Paradise."

It is widely considered a cult classic and one of the \"Best books of the 20th century\". The book follows two interweaving storylines, one in Ancient Eurasia and one in the present-day. Darkly humorous and \"presented in an idiosyncratic fictional style\", the story connects dueling perfumers in Seattle, Paris and New Orleans to a bottle of incomparable perfume created by two unlikely but defiant lovers of the past who seek immortality. Orchestrated by a mysterious Irish philosopher, the past and the present collide when the characters come together and discover the unexpected path to life-everlasting. The book was first published in 1984 by Bantam Books and later published by Random House."

  "text" : "Jacob's Room is the third novel by Virginia Woolf, first published on 26 October 1922. The novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders and is presented almost entirely through the impressions other characters have of Jacob. Thus, although it could be said that the book is primarily a character study and has little in the way of plot or background, the narrative is constructed with a void in place of the central character if, indeed, the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional terms. Motifs of emptiness and absence haunt the novel and establish its elegiac feel. Jacob is described to us, but in such indirect terms that it would seem better to view him as an amalgam of the different perceptions of the characters and narrator. He does not exist as a concrete reality, but rather as a collection of memories and sensations."

The eighth Jeeves novel, Jeeves in the Offing chronicles another visit by Bertie Wooster to his Aunt Dahlia at Brinkley Court, and marks the beginning of a friendship between Bertie and Sir Roderick Glossop, who in previous novels have greatly disliked one another. It is the only novel to feature Aubrey Upjohn, former headmaster of Malvern House Preparatory School, as a major character. With Jeeves on vacation, Bertie is a guest at his Aunt Dahlia's spacious residence, Brinkley Court. Also in residence are an American family, the Creams, who must be handled delicately to prevent their cancelling a big business deal with Bertie’s uncle; the Rev. Aubrey Upjohn, Bertie’s former prep school headmaster, who still chills Bertie’s soul; Upjohn’s insipid daughter and Aunt Dahlia's goddaughter, Phyllis, who is infatuated with the playboy kleptomaniac wastrel American, Willie Cream, and must be put off; Bertie's old pal Roberta Wickham, engaged to be married to Bertie’s old school pal Reginald Kipper Herring, who has written a caustic, libelous review of Upjohn’s memoirs and thus whose future depends on assuaging Upjohn’s wrathful soul; and familiar face Roderick Glossop, eminent psychologist to the rich and famous, is there undercover disguised as a butler, to assess Willie Cream surreptitiously."

  "text" : "Journal to Eliza is a work by British author Laurence Sterne. It was published posthumously in 1904. Sterne wrote it in the summer of 1767 as he neared the end of his life. At that time he was also writing A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy, where the 'little picture of Eliza' that Yorick wears around his neck is mentioned at the outset. The journal is in the form of a diary-cum-letter and was inspired by his deep affection for Mrs. Elizabeth Draper whom he had met when she visited England in 1765-1767. She was the 22 year old wife of an East India Company official and sister of Rawson Hart Boddam. Her husband had brought her over here to recuperate from illness. Given both parties were already married, the relationship was regarded as scandalous. The author adopts the pseudonym Parson Yorick, who previously appeared in his two best known novels, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy. In Tristram Shandy we are told that the parson is related to the famous, fictional jester Yorick whose skull is disinterred in Shakespeare’s Hamlet: \"It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than that of the king’s chief Jester;—and that Hamlet’s Yorick, in our Shakespear, many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated facts,—was certainly the very man.\" In a second example of the author's playfulness with names, Sterne and Eliza receive the pet names ‘Bramin’ and ‘Bramine’ throughout. Given the Brahmin Hindu priestly caste is renowned for austerity and wisdom, Sterne thereby draws attention to his real-life role as a priest. Simultaneously, Eliza's epithet Bramine highlights her connections with India. This playful religious name-calling serves to remind us that Sterne was an Anglican clergyman. Remembered now for his fiction, in his day more copies of his Sermons were published than of his novels. There is characteristically Sternian ambiguity in the Journal concerning whether it was written as a private extended love letter to Elizabeth Draper, or was intended for publication as literature. It appears to be both autobiographical and an imaginative work of fiction, and Sterne says he is writing for posterity: \"...when You and I are at rest for ever— Some Annotator or explainer of my works in this place will take occasion, to speak of the Friendship which Subsisted so long and faithfully betwixt Yorick and the Lady he speaks of.\""

  "text" : "Josephine Mutzenbacher – The Life Story of a Viennese Whore, as Told by Herself (German: Josefine Mutzenbacher – Die Lebensgeschichte Einer Wienerischen Dirne, Von Ihr Selbst Erzählt) is an erotic novel first published anonymously in Vienna, Austria in 1906. The novel is famous in the German-speaking world, having been in print in both German and English for over 100 years and sold over 3 million copies, becoming an erotic bestseller. Although no author claimed responsibility for the work, it was originally attributed to either Felix Salten (see Bambi) or Arthur Schnitzler by the librarians at the University of Vienna. Today, critics, scholars, academics and the Austrian Government designate Salten as the sole author of the \"pornographic classic\", Josephine Mutzenbacher. The original novel uses the specific local dialect of Vienna of that time in dialogues and is therefore used as a rare source of this dialect for linguists. It also describes, to some extent, the social and economical conditions of the lower class of that time. The novel has been translated into English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Dutch, Japanese, Swedish and Finnish, and been the subject of numerous films, theater productions, parodies, and university courses, as well as two sequels."

  "text" : "Jonathan Troy (1954) was Edward Abbey's first published novel, as detailed in James M. Cahalan's biography of Abbey. Only 5,000 copies were printed and almost immediately after it was released the author wanted to disown the work. He asked that it never be published again, and it has not been, making it very rare and the only one of his eight novels that many Edward Abbey fans have not read. When a fan once asked where they could find a copy of the novel, Abbey is reported to have told them \"I don't know where you can find one, but if you do, burn it.\" Copies of the book offered for sale online start at $1,300 and go up to $4,500. Abbey's disgust with the novel was immediate. According to James M. Cahalan's biography, Edward Abbey, A Life, he could barely get through the galleys before the book was published. He said it seemed \"even worse than I had thought,\" too \"juvenile, naive, succeeded in almost nothing. Too much empty rhetoric, not enough meat and bone. Not convincing. All the obvious faults of the beginner.\" In 1984 Abbey was quoted by William Plummer in \"Edward Abbey's Desert Solecisms\" as saying that Jonathan Troy \"was a disgusting novel, fortunately long out of print. ... It's about the agonies of growing up in a small town: pimples and masturbation. There's a Faulkner chapter, an entire chapter in one sentence ... There's a Thomas Wolfe wind-through-the-trees-outside-the-farmhouse chapter, a Joyce chapter, and of course there are newspaper clips all through the thing, like in Dos Passos's Nineteen Nineteen.\" This is the only one of Abbey's eight novels that was set entirely east of the Mississippi River and away from his beloved deserts of the Southwestern United States. He does spend a good portion of The Fool's Progress in West Virginia, but it starts in Tucson and then follows a road trip to its climax."

  "text" : "Jill The Reckless is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on October 8, 1920 by George H. Doran, New York, (under the title The Little Warrior), and in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London, on 4 July 1921. It was serialised in Collier's (US) between 10 April and 28 August 1920, in Maclean's (Canada) between 1 August and 15 November 1920, in both cases as The Little Warrior, and, as Jill the Reckless, in the Grand Magazine (UK), from September 1920 to June 1921. The heroine here, Jill Mariner, is a sweet-natured and wealthy young woman who, at the opening, is engaged to a knighted MP, Sir Derek Underhill. We follow her through financial disaster, an adventure with a parrot, a policeman and the colourful proletariat, a broken engagement, an awkward stay with some grasping relatives, employment as a chorus girl, and of course, the finding of true love. Other characters include wealthy, dimwitted clubman Freddie Rooke (a precursor of Bertie Wooster), ruggedly attractive writer Wally Mason, both of these childhood friends of Jill's; her financially inept uncle Major Christopher Selby; and Sir Derek's domineering mother, Lady Underhill; Jill's unpleasant relatives in Long Island, New York; Elmer, Julia and Tibby Mariner; Drones Club member Algy Martyn, various chorus girls, composers and other theatrical types, and, of course, miscellaneous servants. George Bevan, composer hero of Wodehouse's previous work A Damsel in Distress, receives a passing mention, as does an unspecified member of the Threepwood family. The dust jacket of the UK first edition published by Herbert Jenkins was designed by Edmund Blampied."

  "text" : "Jihad vs. McWorld: How Globalism and Tribalism Are Reshaping the World is a 1995 book by American political scientist Benjamin Barber, in which he puts forth a theory that describes the struggle between \"McWorld\" (globalization and the corporate control of the political process) and \"Jihad\" (Arabic term for \"struggle,\" here modified to mean tradition and traditional values, in the form of extreme nationalism or religious orthodoxy and theocracy). Benjamin Barber similarly questions the impact of economic globalization as well as its problems for democracy. The book was based on a March 1992 article by Barber first published in The Atlantic Monthly. The book employs the basic critique of neoliberalism seen in Barber's earlier, seminal work Strong Democracy. As neoliberal economic theory—not to be confused with social liberalism—is the force behind globalization, this critique is relevant on a much larger scale. Unregulated market forces encounter parochial (which he calls tribal) forces. These tribal forces come in many varieties: religious, cultural, ethnic, regional, local, etc. As globalization imposes a culture of its own on a population, the tribal forces feel threatened and react. More than just economic, the crises that arise from these confrontations often take on a sacred quality to the tribal elements; thus Barber's use of the term \"Jihad\" (although in the second edition, he expresses regret at having used that term). Barber's prognosis in Jihad vs McWorld is generally negative—he concludes that neither global corporations nor traditional cultures are supportive of democracy. He further posits that McWorld could ultimately win the \"struggle\". He also proposes a model for small, local democratic institutions and civic engagement as the hope for an alternative to these two forces."

  "text" : "(This article is about the novel by Céline. For other uses, see Journey to the End of the Night (disambiguation).) Journey to the End of the Night (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) is the first novel by Louis-Ferdinand Céline. This semi-autobiographical work describes antihero Ferdinand Bardamu. Bardamu is involved with World War I, colonial Africa, and post–World War I United States (where he works for the Ford Motor Company), returning in the second half of the work to France, where he becomes a medical doctor and establishes a practice in a poor Paris suburb, the fictional La Garenne-Rancy. The novel also satirizes the medical profession and the vocation of scientific research. The disparate elements of the work are linked together by recurrent encounters with Léon Robinson, a hapless character whose experiences parallel, to some extent, Bardamu's experiences. Voyage au bout de la nuit is a nihilistic novel of savage, exultant misanthropy, combined, however, with cynical humour. Céline expresses an almost unrelieved pessimism with regard to human nature, human institutions, society, and life in general. Towards the end of the book, the narrator Bardamu, who is working at an insane asylum, remarks: …I cannot refrain from doubting that there exist any genuine realizations of our deepest character except war and illness, those two infinities of nightmare,(…je ne peux m'empêcher de mettre en doute qu'il existe d'autres véritables réalisations de nos profonds tempéraments que la guerre et la maladie, ces deux infinis du cauchemar,)— Voyage au bout de la nuit [Paris: Folio plus classiques, 2006], p. 442) A clue to understanding Céline's Voyage lies in the trauma he suffered during his experience in World War I. This is revealed by a study of biographical and literary research on Céline, histories of the war, diaries of his cavalry regiment, and literature on the trauma of war. Céline's experience of the war leads to \"…the obsession, the recurrent anguish, the refusal, the delirium, the violence, the pacifism, the anti-Semitic aberration of the 30’s, [and] his philosophy of life ….\""

The title refers to the sibling rivalry between Jacob and Esau in the Jewish and Christian Bible, and comes directly from Romans 9:13: \"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.\" The novel follows the story of the Bradshaws, a family who depends on the father, Truitt Bradshaw, and his crabbing/fishing business on his boat, the Portia Sue. Truitt's two daughters, Sara Louise and Caroline, are twins, and Caroline has always been the favorite. She is prettier and more talented, and better at receiving more attention not only from their parents but also from others in the community. The book traces Louise's attempts to free herself from Caroline's shadow, even as she grows into adulthood."

  "text" : "Junk, known as Smack in the U.S., is a realistic novel for young adults by the British author Melvin Burgess, published in 1996 by Andersen in the U.K. Set on the streets of Bristol, England, it features two runaway teens who join a group of squatters, where they fall into heroin addiction and embrace anarchism. Both critically and commercially it is the best received of Burgess' novels. Yet it was unusually controversial at first, criticized negatively for its \"how-to\" aspect, or its dark realism, or its moral relativism. Burgess won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's outstanding children's book by a British author. For the 70th anniversary of the Medal in 2007 Junk was named one of the top ten winning works, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite.Junk also won the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice. It is the latest of six books to win both awards. In the U.S., Henry Holt published the novel in 1997 as Smack —another slang term for heroin."

  "text" : "Julie, or the New Heloise (French: Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse) is an epistolary novel by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, published in 1761 by Marc-Michel Rey in Amsterdam. The original edition was entitled Lettres de deux amans habitans d'une petite ville au pied des Alpes (\"Letters from two lovers living in a small town at the foot of the Alps\"). The novel's subtitle points to the history of Héloïse d'Argenteuil and Peter Abelard, a medieval story of passion and Christian renunciation. The novel was put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Although Rousseau wrote it as a novel, a philosophical theory about authenticity permeates through it, as he explores autonomy and authenticity as moral values. A common interpretation is that Rousseau valued the ethics of authenticity over rational moral principles, as he illustrates the principle that one should do what is imposed upon him by society only insofar as it would seem congruent with one's \"secret principles\" and feelings, being constituent of one's core identity. Thus unauthentic behavior would pave the way to self-destruction. Arthur Schopenhauer cited Julie, or the New Heloise as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with Tristram Shandy, Wilhelm Meister, and Don Quixote."

  "text" : "John Inglesant is a celebrated historical novel by Joseph Henry Shorthouse, published in 1881, and set mainly in the middle years of the 17th century. The eponymous hero is an Anglican, despite being educated partly by Jesuits, and remains so, largely on the advice of his Jesuit mentor, despite strong temptations to convert to Roman Catholicism. Even so, he finds himself involved in intrigues between the Roman Catholic Church and the High Church party of the Church of England, and becomes a courtier of Charles I. He also spends some time at Nicholas Ferrar's community at Little Gidding, where he falls in love (the girl soon dies). He fights on the Royalist side in the English Civil War, is wounded at the battle of Edgehill, and fights at Naseby. As a result of his role in negotiations on the King's behalf in Ireland, he is tried and condemned for treason; he only narrowly escapes execution. Soon afterwards his brother is murdered, and he pursues his brother's murderer to Italy, where among much else (including marriage) he observes a Papal Conclave as it elects a new Pope in Rome. Despite all the above, this is a book of ideas, not action, and religious ideas at that. Every page of brisk activity or intrigue is usually followed by at least two more of debate on such topics as Arminianism, Quietism, the Papacy, and the like. Even by the standards of its time, it is a wordy book, and at the opposite extreme from the preferred all-action mode of the 21st century. It nonetheless has what might be described as a cult following. Its subtitle ('John Inglesant: a romance') may also be misleading to modern readers; it implies free invention, not love interest, and the book has little or nothing in common with the romance novel of the present day."

  "text" : "Juneteenth is Ralph Ellison's second novel, published posthumously in 1999 as a 368-page condensation of over 2000 pages written by him over a period of forty years. It was originally written without any real organization, and Ellison's longtime friend, biographer and critic John F. Callahan put the novel together, editing it in the way he thought Ellison would want it to be written. Ellison claimed to be devastated when much of the original manuscript of Juneteenth was destroyed by a fire in 1967. However, the loss of the crucial, irrecoverable sections of his manuscript appears to have been something Ellison concocted after the fact to justify his lack of progress. Arnold Rampersad, in his 2007 biography of Ellison, points out that, following the fire, Ellison wrote to critic Nathan Scott of his relief that he still \"fortunately had a full copy\" of all his writing. While there had been over 2,000 pages written by the time of his death, the novel was never finished by the author himself. A fuller version of the manuscript was published on February 2, 2010, as Three Days Before the Shooting."

The novel is at one level a fierce critique of the gene-gathering work of deCODE genetics: far from reinforcing the kind of myths of Icelandic national identity promoted by eugenicists earlier in the twentieth century and re-invoked by the publicity machine around DeCODE, Indriđason’s novel uses the figure of the defective gene not only to expose and trouble national mythologies of social and familial cohesion and continuity but to ask some fundamental questions about the meaning of innocence and guilt, justice and punishment in the face of the identification of genes that bear the secret not of life but of death."

  "text" : "Journal of a Sad Hermaphrodite is a book written - and, some would say, compiled - by the English writer Michael de Larrabeiti and published in the United Kingdom by Aidan Ellis in 1992 (ISBN 0-85628-200-6). It is currently out of print, but is due to be republished in quarter 4 2006/quarter 1 2007 by Tallis House. Supposedly reproduced from a manuscript constructed by Cooper, a teacher of English Literature in a secondary school in a small Oxfordshire town, the Journal includes clippings from Cooper's commonplace book, clippings from the diary of one of Cooper's students (who is not named) and excerpts of poetry and other well-known texts. The Journal is perhaps influenced by Cyril Connolly's The Unquiet Grave in this respect, although it modifies Connolly's use of the \"commonplace book\" technique - itself perhaps borrowed by Connolly from George Gissing's The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft - to produce a more traditional narrative. This Journal narrates the final school year of the student whose diary is included in the text, and reflects on various themes, many of which are to do with individual morality: how, and why, one makes the choices one does and lives the life one lives. The overarching theme of the text, which connects the narratives of Cooper and his student - who together make up the \"Hermaphrodite\" of the title, is perhaps that of writing: how to write, why to write, and what to write. This theme could be seen to be a further influence from Cyril Connolly, who considers his own failure to produce a major work of literature in Enemies of Promise."

  "text" : "Jihad (English pronunciation: /dʒɪˈhɑːd/; Arabic: جهاد‎‎ jihād [dʒɪˈhaːd]) is an Islamic term referring to the religious duty of Muslims to maintain and spread the religion. In Arabic, the word jihād is a noun meaning the act of \"striving, applying oneself, struggling, persevering\". A person engaged in jihad is called a mujahid (Arabic: مجاهد‎‎), the plural of which is mujahideen (مجاهدين). The word jihad appears frequently in the Quran, often in the idiomatic expression \"striving in the way of God (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)\", to refer to the act of striving to serve the purposes of God on this earth. Muslims and scholars do not all agree on its definition. Many observers—both Muslim and non-Muslim—as well as the Dictionary of Islam, talk of jihad having two meanings: an inner spiritual struggle (the \"greater jihad\"), and an outer physical struggle against the enemies of Islam (the \"lesser jihad\") which may take a violent or non-violent form. Jihad is often translated as \"Holy War\", although this term is controversial. According to orientalist Bernard Lewis, \"the overwhelming majority of classical theologians, jurists\", and specialists in the hadith \"understood the obligation of jihad in a military sense.\" Javed Ahmad Ghamidi states that there is consensus among Islamic scholars that the concept of jihad will always include armed struggle against wrongdoers. It was generally supposed that the order for a general war could only be given by the Caliph (an office that was claimed by the Ottoman sultans), but Muslims who did not acknowledge the spiritual authority of the Caliphate (which has been vacant since 1923)—such as non-Sunnis and non-Ottoman Muslim states—always looked to their own rulers for the proclamation of a jihad. There has been in fact no universal warfare by Muslims on non-believers since the early caliphate. Some proclaimed jihad by claiming themselves as mahdi, e.g. the Sudanese Mahommed Ahmad in 1882. In classical Islam, the military form of jihad was also regulated to protect civilians. Jihad is sometimes referred to as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status. In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion."

  "text" : "(This article is about the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. For other persons, see Joseph Smith (disambiguation).) Joseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader and founder of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement. When he was twenty-four, Smith published the Book of Mormon. By the time of his death fourteen years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present. Smith was born in Sharon, Vermont, but by 1817, he had moved with his family to the burned-over district of western New York, an area of intense religious revivalism during the Second Great Awakening. According to Smith, he experienced a series of visions, including one in which he saw \"two personages\" (presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ) and others in which an angel named Moroni directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates, the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the Church of Christ, calling it a restoration of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\", or \"Mormons\", and in 1838, Smith announced a revelation that renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American Zion. They first gathered in Kirtland, Ohio, and established an outpost in Independence, Missouri, which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the expensive Kirtland Temple. Nevertheless, the collapse of the church-sponsored Kirtland Safety Society and violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at Nauvoo, Illinois, where he became a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, Smith and the Nauvoo city council angered non-Mormons by destroying a newspaper that had criticized Smith's power and practice of polygamy. After Smith was imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, he was killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse. Smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings include unique views about the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to Moses and Elijah, and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church he organized, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ."

  "text" : "Jack's Return Home is a 1970 novel by British writer Ted Lewis. An uncompromising novel of a brutal half-world of pool halls, massage parlours and teenage pornography, it was memorably brought to life in the cult film Get Carter, starring Michael Caine as Jack Carter. The novel starkly portrays a subsection of society living on the dangerous borderline between crime and respectability. The book was a major influence on the noir school of English crime fiction. The novel went out of print for many years and slipped into obscurity, but there was a resurgence of interest in it in the 1990s after the 1971 film adaptation, Get Carter, gradually grew in reputation and was remade in 2000. The book was republished in paperback under the title Get Carter by Allison & Busby in 1993. In 2016 the playwright Torben Betts adapted the novel for a critically acclaimed production by Newcastle's Northern Stage."

The title derives from an English translation of Psalms 30:5: \"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" Wodehouse was working on the novel in Le Touquet (France) before he was interned by the occupying German authorities. He completed the book in Germany after his wife, Ethel, brought the unfinished manuscript with her when she joined her husband in Berlin. The manuscript was completed in Degenershausen, a small village in the Harz mountains."

  "text" : "First commissioned for \"the dragon quintet\" edited by Marvin Kaye, \"Joust\" appeared as a short story along with \"In the Dragon's House\" by Orson Scott Card, \"Judgment\" by Elizabeth Moon, \"Love in a time of Dragons\" by Tanith Lee and \"Dragon King\" by Michael Swanwick. Joust (2003) is the first in a planned tetralogy by Mercedes Lackey. The books are set in a fictional version of Pharaonic Egypt. The Upper Kingdom is named Tia and the Lower Kingdom is Alta. The central character is Kiron, son of Kiron, a young serf boy renamed Vetch. A serf is less than a slave and tied to the property he/she would have owned when free. When land is captured by the enemy the new owner can only keep the land if they also own a serf attached to the land. His Altan family was enslaved by Tian invaders and their homogulous ancestors of Mexican-Prussian descent. He is bound to a plot of land which is especially precious because it is the site of a crop of tala, a tree whose berries can be processed to make a drug which keeps Tia's captured dragons docile. Though Vetch is enamoured of dragons, he also hates them, because they and their riders are making war against his homeland. His master, Khefti-the-fat, is cruel to him, and Vetch has nothing left except his desire for revenge. A Jouster happens to observe Khefti's cruelty and confiscates Vetch to tend his dragon. As a dragon boy, Vetch finds life much easier, since he is now able to get adequate food and wear clean clothing. He develops a reluctant respect and even liking for Jouster Ari. Kashet, Ari's dragon, is unique in that he is tame; he does not need tala to be docile. Ari raised him from infancy. Khefti-the-fat's one attempt to reclaim Vetch backfires, and Vetch's desire for revenge subsides somewhat. It chafes at him, however, that as an Altan serf he can never be freed. When a training accident goes awry and one of the female dragons escapes control long enough to mate, Vetch sees his chance for freedom. He offers to take over the care of the pregnant female, Coresan, in addition to tending to Kashet. When she lays an egg, he steals it and tends to it in secret. His dragon is a scarlet female he names Avatre. His young dragon goes unnoticed as several other young dragons have been brought to the Jousters' compound as a new training experiment. Avatre is discovered by another dragon boy, before she has fledged (first taken flight). By luck Vetch is on her back, and she is startled into flight. They cannot outfly Ari and Kashet, however, and Vetch tries to commit suicide by leaping from Avatre's back, rather than lose her to another Jouster, but Ari catches him. To Vetch's surprise, Ari is sympathetic to his plan. He convinces the other Jousters that Vetch has died, provisions him in secret, and sends him north. The book ends with Vetch crossing over into Altan territory and reclaiming his father's name, Kiron. The four books in this series are \n*  Joust (2003) \n*  Alta (2004) \n*  Sanctuary (May 2005) \n*  Aerie (Oct 2006)"

  "text" : "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈtɒlkiːn/; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009."

  "text" : "Jalna is a novel by the Canadian writer Mazo de la Roche. It is the first of a 16-novel family saga about the Whiteoak family. First published in 1927, Jalna won the Atlantic Monthly Press's first $10,000 Atlantic Prize Novel award. De la Roche went on to write about the Whiteoak family for the next 30 years, establishing a place for herself in popular Canadian literature. The Jalna series has been translated into many languages and was adapted for stage, radio, and television. John Cromwell directed a 1935 film adaptation, Jalna. In 1972, it was filmed for television as The Whiteoaks of Jalna. Jalna is the name of the fictional manor house in which the Whiteoak family lives. The name comes from Jalna, a city in west-central India, where there was a British garrison. In a prequel novel, the house is built by a retired officer of the British army who served in India. Jalna is partly based on Benares, a house in Mississauga, Canada. Benares was built in the late 1850s for a retired officer of the British army who had served in India, James B. Harris. It once occupied a larger estate, upon which de la Roche lived for a time. \"Banaras\" is the former name of Varanasi, a city in India which had a British garrison."

  "text" : "Jurassic Park is a 1990 science fiction novel written by Michael Crichton, divided into seven sections (iterations). A cautionary tale about genetic engineering, it presents the collapse of an amusement park showcasing genetically recreated dinosaurs to illustrate the mathematical concept of chaos theory and its real world implications. A sequel titled The Lost World, also written by Crichton, was published in 1995. In 1997, both novels were re-published as a single book titled Michael Crichton's Jurassic World, unrelated to the film of the same name. In 1993, Steven Spielberg adapted the book into the blockbuster film Jurassic Park. The book's sequel, The Lost World, was also adapted by Spielberg into a film in 1997. A third film directed by Joe Johnston and released in 2001 drew several elements, themes and scenes from both books that were ultimately not utilized in either of the previous films, such as the aviary and boat scenes. A fourth entry directed by Colin Trevorrow was released on June 12, 2015. The novel began as a screenplay Crichton wrote in 1983, about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur. Eventually, given his reasoning that genetic research is expensive and \"there is no pressing need to create a dinosaur\", Crichton concluded that it would emerge from a \"desire to entertain\", leading to a wildlife park of extinct animals. Originally it was told from the point of view of a child, but Crichton changed it as everyone who read the draft felt it would be better if told by an adult."

  "text" : "Joris of the Rock is a fantasy novel by Leslie Barringer, the second book in his three volume Neustrian Cycle. It is set around the fourteenth century in an alternate medieval France called Neustria (historically an early division of the Frankish kingdom). The book was first published in the United Kingdom by Heinemann in 1928; an American edition followed from Doubleday in 1929. Its significance was recognized by its republication by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the ninth volume of the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library series in September, 1976. The Newcastle edition was reprinted by Borgo Press in 1980 and 2010. The publisher's blurb for the 1928 edition reads: \"Mediaeval outlaws were not as a rule good neighbours, and Joris is no exception. Believing himself to be one of the men for whom this world was made, he challenges Church and State, loves and waits for the witch, Red Anne, fights a fiend by the Singing Stones, finds a kingdom in his gift, and meets at length the youth who is his son. The interwoven lives of Joris and Juhel afford a texture now harsh now delicate, shadowed by grimmest irony, yet lit with fires of loyalty and faith. The action of the story, beginning before the action of Gerfalcon, includes and overpasses the time of the latter; neither tale is needed for the enjoyment of the other, but many readers will welcome a new encounter with Raoul of Ger and his friends in the days of their prosperity.\" Chapter headings of the 1928 edition: 1.  \n* The way of Joris of the Rock. 2.  \n* The tower of Ath. 3.  \n* Herodias at Hastain. 4.  \n* The patience of Joris of the Rock. 5.  \n* Diana in the forest. 6.  \n* Saint-Eloy-over-Hardonek. 7.  \n* Gramberge and the Singing Stones. 8.  \n* Colloquy at Belsaunt. 9.  \n* The spires of Hautarroy. 10.  \n* The glory of Joris of the Rock. 11.  \n* The causeway at Markmont. 12.  \n* Pont-de-Foy. 13.  \n* The beating of the high hills. 14.  \n* The son of Joris of the Rock."

  "text" : "Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver (original title: Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer) is a German children's novel written by Michael Ende. Published in 1960, it became one of the most successful German children's books in the postwar era after having first been rejected by a dozen publishers. It received the German Young Literature Prize in 1961 and has been translated into 33 languages. Its huge success later spawned the sequel Jim Button and the Wild 13 (original title: Jim Knopf und die Wilde 13). Michael Ende grew up in Nazi Germany. His father, Edgar Ende, a painter, was banned as \"degenerate\" in 1936. Ende began writing the story in 1956 to provide a contrast to the Nazis' racist ideology and their misuse of the theory of evolution. In a 1991 radio interview, he stated, \"The idea of racism and racial discrimination came from further consideration of Darwin's theories.\" Quoting Nazi euphemisms, he added, \"The 'extermination of lives unworthy of life' and 'concentration camps'.\" Ende did not see his book as a children's book, but just wrote it for himself. He based the title character on Jemmy Button, a native Fuegian who, as a teenager in the 19th century, was sold for a mother-of-pearl button and taken to England. He later returned to his homeland on the HMS Beagle, by way of the Galapagos Islands, along with fellow passenger Charles Darwin, who later wrote about the episode. That Ende's book was full of Nazi symbols and imagery turned on their head, and that its English references stemmed from his interest in Darwin was unknown until late 2008, when Julia Voss, a German journalist, published an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung revealing the story's background. Voss cites aspects of Ende's book and of English colonialism, showing their similarity. Her examples of Nazi education and indoctrination, as well as information about Ende's own experiences with it, reveal the sources that inspired him."

Set in the late 80s and early 90s, it follows the members of the radical Jokerman troupe as they spike trees, sink an Icelandic whaling vessel, and occupy a construction crane on the eve of the groundbreaking of an animal research facility on the University of California campus. The writing style recalls works by Ken Kesey and Tom Robbins, though its closest literary cousin is The Monkey Wrench Gang, by Edward Abbey. The novel is also noted for its evocation of The Beatles and U2 (in particular the album The Joshua Tree)."

Gould was an eccentric, bridging the gap between bohemianism and the beat generation, though he was an outspoken critic of both. This criticism alienated him from the social circles of poets, authors, and artists of his time, and instead he focused on documenting the history of what he called the \"shirt-sleeved multitude.\""

  "text" : "Joseph Had a Little Overcoat is the title of a 1999 book by Simms Taback that won the 2000 Caldecott Medal. The main character is Joseph, a 40-something Jewish farmer, who has a little striped overcoat. When it is old, Joseph makes it into a little jacket and so on until he makes it into a button. Then Joseph loses the button and makes a story out of it. The moral of the story is \"you can always make something out of nothing.\" The story has die-cut illustrations consisting of watercolor and collage. Readers of the story say that Joseph greatly resembles Simms Taback. Joseph Had a Little Overcoat is based on the Yiddish song I Had a Little Overcoat. Barbara Kiefer, chair of the Caldecott Award Committee, commented, \"Vibrant rich colors, playful details, and skillfully-placed die cuts contribute to the books raucous merriment that takes this Yiddish folk song far beyond the simple words.\" The story is read on the children’s show Between the Lions."

  "text" : "Jaws is a 1974 novel by American writer Peter Benchley. It tells the story of a great white shark that preys upon a small resort town and the voyage of three men trying to kill it. The novel grows out of Benchley's interest in shark attacks after he learned about the exploits of shark fisherman Frank Mundus in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, a period when Benchley struggled as a freelance journalist. Through a marketing campaign orchestrated by Doubleday and paperback publisher Bantam, Jaws was incorporated into many book sales clubs catalogues and attracted media interest. After first publication in February 1974, the novel was a great success, with the hardback staying on the bestseller list for some 44 weeks and the subsequent paperback selling millions of copies in the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many literary critics finding the prose and characterization lacking despite the novel's effective suspense. Film producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown read the novel before its publication and bought the film rights, selecting Steven Spielberg to direct the film adaptation. The Jaws film, released in June 1975, omitted many of the novel's minor subplots, focusing more on the shark and the characterizations of the three protagonists. Jaws became the highest grossing movie in history up to that point, becoming a watershed film in motion picture history and the father of the summer blockbuster film. Three sequels followed the film."

  "text" : "\"Jonestown\" was the informal name for the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project  formed by the Peoples Temple, an American religious organization under the leadership of Jim Jones, in northwestern Guyana. It became internationally notorious when on November 18, 1978, a total of 918 people died in the remote commune, at the nearby airstrip in Port Kaituma, and in Georgetown, Guyana's capital city. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations. A total of 909 Americans died in Jonestown, all but two from apparent cyanide poisoning, in an event termed \"revolutionary suicide\" by Jones and some members on an audio tape of the event and in prior discussions. The poisonings in Jonestown followed the murder of five others by Temple members at Port Kaituma, including United States Congressman Leo Ryan. Four other Temple members died in Georgetown at Jones' command. The actions in Jonestown have always been commonly viewed as mass suicide, although some sources, including Jonestown survivors, regard them as mass murder instead. It was the largest such event in modern history and resulted in the largest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act until September 11, 2001. In recent years, the Jonestown massacre has been the subject of several conspiracy theories."

  "text" : "(This article is about the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. For other persons, see Joseph Smith (disambiguation).) Joseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader and founder of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement. When he was twenty-four, Smith published the Book of Mormon. By the time of his death fourteen years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present. Smith was born in Sharon, Vermont, but by 1817, he had moved with his family to the burned-over district of western New York, an area of intense religious revivalism during the Second Great Awakening. According to Smith, he experienced a series of visions, including one in which he saw \"two personages\" (presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ) and others in which an angel named Moroni directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates, the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the Church of Christ, calling it a restoration of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\", or \"Mormons\", and in 1838, Smith announced a revelation that renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American Zion. They first gathered in Kirtland, Ohio, and established an outpost in Independence, Missouri, which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the expensive Kirtland Temple. Nevertheless, the collapse of the church-sponsored Kirtland Safety Society and violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at Nauvoo, Illinois, where he became a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, Smith and the Nauvoo city council angered non-Mormons by destroying a newspaper that had criticized Smith's power and practice of polygamy. After Smith was imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, he was killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse. Smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings include unique views about the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to Moses and Elijah, and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church he organized, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ."

  "text" : "Japanese Society (1970) is an analysis of the structure of Japanese society, written by Nakane Chie. The main theme of the book is the working of what Nakane calls \"the vertical principle\" in Japanese society, which is a series of social relations between two individuals, one of whom is senior and one of whom is junior. Nakane also formulates the criteria of 'attribute' and 'frame' to illuminate that way that groups are formed in Japan, and to compare Japan with other countries. Her thesis is that 'frame', which is circumstantial and may be \"a locality, an institution or a particular relationship which binds a set of individuals into one group, is more important that 'attribute', \"which may be acquired not only by birth but by achievement\", examples of which include \"a definite descent group or caste\". This situation is contrasted with India. The book is broken down into four chapters: \n* Criteria of Group Formation \n* The Internal Structure of the Group \n* The Overall Structure of the Society \n* Characteristics and Value Orientation of Japanese Man"

  "text" : "Jacky Daydream is an autobiographical book about Jacqueline Wilson's childhood, first published in 2007. The book's title refers to a nickname given to the author when she was at school. The teacher, Mr Branson (who the children nicknamed Brandy Balls) would give all the children nicknames according to their character; initially he rather cruelly dubbed her \"Jacky Four-eyes\" when she came to school in glasses, subsequently he named her \"Jacky Daydream\" for staring out of the window during maths, a subject she hated. The book details her very early life, from babyhood to the summer she was 11, when she is about to start at secondary school. The book is interspersed with many photos of the author at that time in her life. She also tells the reader what inspired her to write certain books, and she ends each chapter with a question that the reader must answer; for instance \"Who had a doll named Bluebell and an imaginary Rottweiler?\" Then she will give the answer. She also gives a rather uncomfortable account of her constantly warring parents, Biddy and Harry. The book reveals that she failed the 11-plus the first time she sat the exams, as she had a terrible cold. She passed it a second time. Jacqueline also writes about her favourite books, her first TV, her first china doll, who was apparently unwieldy, her parents' marriage, her first boyfriend David and many more facts about her life. Jac writes with love about her maternal grand parents, Ga and Gongon (nicknamed by Jacky before she could speak properly). She has stated that from an early age she was determined to deal with \"real\" issues that affect children, and not to write Enid Blyton-style stories, although she greatly admired them.She was also a great fan of the child actress Mandy Miller, who was about a year older.She frequently talks about her favourite books and dolls she played with when she was a child. She is still an avid collector of both books and dolls and she also still enjoys reading and writing."

The publisher wanted it to be written in two different sections, both published at the same time. The novel received the 27th Mystery Writers of Japan Award and the Seiun Award for a Japanese novel-length work. The novel has led to works in other media as well as sequels: a film based on the novel was made in the same year directed by Shiro Moritani, a television show made in 1975, and a remake in 2006 by Shinji Higuchi. In 1995, after the Osaka-Kobe earthquake, Komatsu published a second English abridged edition (ISBN 4-7700-2039-2). In 2006, a sequel to the novel was published and there is talk of a third."

It was originally published in 1960 by Gold Medal Books, again in 1983 by Naiad Press, and again in 2003 by Cleis Press. Each edition was adorned with a different cover. As Bannon explained in the forward of the 2001 edition of Odd Girl Out, Gold Medal Press publishers had control over the cover art and the title of all the books published through them. Bannon's publisher titled the book. Lesbian pulp fiction books usually showed suggestive art with obscure titles that hinted at what the subject matter was inside. It is preceded by Women in the Shadows and followed by Beebo Brinker chronologically, although in the course of events of the characters, this is the last in the series. Beebo Brinker, in the course of events, was written last but is set first."

  "text" : "Journey to Ixtlan is the third book by Carlos Castaneda, published as a work of non-fiction by Simon & Schuster in 1972. It is about an alleged apprenticeship to the Yaqui \"shaman,\" Don Juan. The title of this book is taken from an allegory that is recounted to Castaneda by his \"benefactor\" who is known to Carlos as Don Genaro ( Genaro Flores ), a close friend of his teacher don Juan Matus. \"Ixtlan\" turns out to be a metaphorical hometown ( or Place / Position of Being ) to which the \"sorcerer\" or warrior or man of knowledge is drawn to return, trying to get home. After the work of \"stopping\", his changed perspective leaves him little in common with ordinary people, who now seem no more substantial to him than \"phantoms.\" The point of the story is that a man of knowledge, or sorcerer, is a changed being, or a Human closer to his true state of Being, and for that reason he can never truly go \"home\" to his old lifestyle again. In Journey to Ixtlan Castaneda essentially reevaluates the teachings up to that point. He discusses information that was apparently missing from the first two books regarding stopping the world which previously he had only regarded as a metaphor. He also finds that psychotropic plants, knowledge of which was a significant part of his apprenticeship to Yaqui shaman don Juan Matus, are not as important in the world view as he had previously thought. In the introduction he writes: My basic assumption in both books has been that the articulation points in learning to be a sorcerer were the states of nonordinary reality produced by the ingestion of psychotropic plants... My perception of the world through the effects of those psychotropics had been so bizarre and impressive that I was forced to assume that such states were the only avenue to communicating and learning what Don Juan was attempting to teach me. That assumption was erroneous. In the book don Juan takes Carlos on these various degrees of apprenticeship, in response to what he believes are signals from the phenomenological world, \"The decision as to who can be a warrior and who can only be a hunter is not up to us. That decision is in the realm of the powers that guide men.\" The book shows a progression between different states of learning, from hunter, to warrior, to man of knowledge or sorcerer, the difference said to be one of skill level and the type of thing hunted, \"...a warrior is an impeccable hunter that hunts power. If he succeeds in his hunting he becomes a man of knowledge.\" Throughout the book Castaneda portrays himself as skeptical and reserved in his explanations of the phenomena at hand, but by the end of the book Castaneda's rationalist worldview is seen to be breaking down in the face of an onslaught of experiences that he is unable to explain logically."

  "text" : "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈtɒlkiːn/; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009."

  "text" : "Japan's Imperial Conspiracy is a nonfiction historical work by David Bergamini. Its subject is the role of Japanese elites in promoting Japanese imperialism and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; in particular, it examines the role of Crown Prince and Emperor Hirohito in the execution of Japan's Imperial conquest, and his role in postwar Japanese society. The book concludes that the conventional conclusion of historical analyses - that the Imperial household was largely powerless and not culpable or particularly supportive of the imperial adventures, blame for which is assigned to military elites - is mistaken. Instead, it asserts that the internal political fighting necessary to gain support for imperialism was a long-premeditated plan supported by all sectors of the elite and especially by members of the imperial family. The reason given as to why the American occupiers allowed the continuation of the institution of the Emperor is that its support was sought for the purposes of fighting Communism and the nearby Soviet Russia. Bergamini draws his conclusion from a variety of sources but gives prominence to his interpretation of various diaries kept by involved figures."

After a series of unlikely adventures, the boys serendipitously foil a gang of fur-coat smugglers, and receive a reward from the police. After the release of a film feature film of the same name, loosely based on the books, Crompton was so impressed with the film that she chose to turn it into a novel."

It details the story of Jimmy, a 13- to 16-year-old thief, who after aiding Prince Arutha & Princess Anita escape Krondor and running afoul of Guy Du Bas-Tyra's secret police has fled south to the town of Land's End. Assuming the villagers have never encountered someone with his talents he becomes fairly optimistic about broadening his horizons, but is unprepared for what greets him. The story is set in the world of Midkemia. It was first released by Harper Collins on July 7, 2003 in the United Kingdom. It was released in the United States in August 2008. The book constitutes a kind of prequel to the earlier published The Riftwar Saga, in which (among many other plot lines) the later life of Jimmy is depicted."

On February 19, 2008, the author's official site revealed twelve stories that will comprise the collection, mentioning the possibility that one additional \"bonus story\" could be included, and on April 16 \"The Cat from Hell\" (a much anthologized but heretofore uncollected short story originally published in 1977) was added to the contents list. King planned to begin writing a new novel, but after he was asked to edit The Best American Short Stories 2007, he was inspired to write short stories instead. Upon King's request, a limited edition was released, along with the regular version, featuring a DVD collection of the 25 episodes of the online animated series based on N., one of the stories collected in this volume."

  "text" : "John Carter of Mars is the eleventh and final book in the Barsoom series by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is not actually a novel but rather a collection of two John Carter of Mars stories. The first story was originally published in 1940 by Whitman as a Better Little Book entitled John Carter of Mars. Although credited to Edgar Rice Burroughs, it was written (and illustrated) by his son, John Coleman Burroughs and was later expanded and re-published in Amazing Stories as \"John Carter and the Giant of Mars\", the name it goes under in the collection. The second story, \"Skeleton Men of Jupiter\", was first published in Amazing Stories in 1943. Intended as the first in a series of novelettes to be later collected in book form, in the fashion of Llana of Gathol, it ends with the plot unresolved, and the intended sequels were never written. Several other writers have written pastiche endings for the story. The first edition of John Carter of Mars (a title that Burroughs never actually used for any book in the Barsoom series) was published in 1964 by Canaveral Press, fourteen years after Burroughs's death."

  "text" : "James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\". Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the US; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27. Hendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\" Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year, and in 1968, Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year. Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the band's three studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time."

  "text" : "Jesus of Nazareth is the first volume in Pope Benedict XVI's three-volume meditation on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The first book authored by Benedict following his ascension to the papacy, it was published by Doubleday in 2007. In the book's introduction, the pope explicitly states that the treatise is in \"no way an exercise of the magisterium,\" but rather an \"expression of his personal search for the face of the Lord.\" It is not, however, primarily meditational or part of the genre of \"edifying literature\", but more directly the book of a theologian, concluding the scientific work of Prof. Ratzinger. Jesus of Nazareth's ten chapters cover the bulk of Jesus' public ministry, encompassing subjects and events such as Christ's baptism at the hands of John the Baptist, the Sermon on the Mount, the meaning of the parables, the Calling of the Twelve, the Confession of Peter, and the Transfiguration. The book stops short of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and subsequent Passion and Resurrection, which are the primary topics of the second volume, Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week, which was published on March 15, 2011. The third and final volume, Jesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives was published on November 21, 2012."

The book takes a light-hearted and humorous series of 'cyclic journeys through the land of trivia'. What marks the book as different from previous books of trivia is that each chapter or 'Round' takes the reader along a chain of interconnected facts ending, ultimately, back at the first fact in the chain. There are 30 of these 'journeys' in the book which are then all linked together in 'The Great Big Joined-Up Index' where Colgan shows the interconnectedness between facts in different Rounds."

  "text" : "Jasper Johns is a non-fiction coffee table book written by Michael Crichton about the artist Jasper Johns. It was originally published in 1977 by Harry N. Abrams Inc in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a second revised edition (ISBN 0810935155) was published in 1994. The psychiatrist Janet Ross owned a copy of the painting Numbers by Jasper Johns in The Terminal Man, another book by Crichton. The technophobic antagonist of the story found it odd that a person would paint numbers as they were inorganic. Michael Crichton himself had a superb art collection, including several important works by Jasper Johns. Most of them were sold at an auction Christie’s in 2010."

Mario Balzic is the protagonist, an atypical detective for the genre, a Serbo-Italian American cop, middle-aged, unpretentious, a family man who asks questions and uses more sense than force. The novel opens with a former coal miner, Albert Castelucci, asking Balzic to investigate the killing of his son. He feels the state police in charge of the case have botched the investigation, but when Balzic begins, he finds more puzzles than he first expected. It is the eighth book in the 17-volume Rocksburg series and was nominated for an Edgar Award."

  "text" : "Journey to Mars the Wonderful World: Its Beauty and Splendor; Its Mighty Races and Kingdoms; Its Final Doom is an 1894 science fiction novel written by Gustavus W. Pope. (The author called his work a \"scientific novel.\") The book has attracted increased contemporary attention as a precedent and possible source for the famous Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. A sequel, Journey to Venus, followed in 1895. Pope's novel is the story of a Lt. Frederick Hamilton, USN. On a voyage to Antarctica, his ship is wrecked; he and a Māori sailor are cast onto a barren island. Though near the end of his endurance, Hamilton rescues a strange-looking man before he loses consciousness. He awakens three weeks later, aboard a spaceship traveling to Mars. (Hamilton at first does not realize his hosts are Martians; he suspects they might have come from within the Hollow Earth through a polar opening, as per John Symmes's theory. Pope also wrote a subterranean fiction novel.) On Pope's Mars there are three human-like races: red, yellow, and blue Martians. They have attained a sophisticated technology while preserving a feudal society (which allows for duels and swordplay), much as in Burroughs's later books. The Martians travel in \"ethervolt cars\" and anti-gravity aircraft; they enjoy communications devices that are equivalent to television and video telephone. Pope also provides a Martian magician who is telepathic, invokes spirits, and reads the hero's future. Hamilton has various adventures, including a romance with the yellow-complexioned Princess Suhlamia. The Martians need to relocate from their world because of impending planetary catastrophe: meteors bombard the planet (the so-called Martian canals are actually linear cities, which makes them thinner targets), and the moons Phobos and Deimos threaten to crash to the surface. Hamilton returns to Earth to try to find space for them. A Martian revolution disrupts his plans, however; he writes no account of his adventures prior to an attempt to return to the red planet. Gustavus W. Pope (1828–1902) was a physician based in Washington DC, who wrote several books on a range of subjects (including one on Shakespeare's supposed Roman Catholicism). Pope followed his Journey to Mars with Journey to Venus the Primeval World; Its Wondrous Creations and Gigantic Monsters (1895), in which Hamilton and Suhlamia visit that planet. Journey to Mars has been reprinted in two modern editions, from Hyperion Press in 1974 and from Wildside Press in 2008. The Hyperion edition features an Introduction by Sam Moskowitz."

  "text" : "Journey to Venus the Primeval World; Its Wonderful Creations and Gigantic Monsters is an 1895 science fiction novel written by Gustavus W. Pope. The book was a sequel to Pope's novel of the previous year, Journey to Mars. The Venus volume features the same hero and heroine, Lt. Frederick Hamilton, USN, and his love interest the Martian princess Suhlamia. They travel to Venus on a Martian \"ethervolt\" spacecraft. The publisher promoted the book as \"full of exciting adventures, hairbreadth escapes, and perilous vicissitudes, among primeval monsters and semi-human creatures, the episodes following each other in such breathless succession that the interest of the reader never flags.\" Modern critics have noted the book largely for its depiction of giant dinosaur-like Venusian beasts. Pope's pair of novels on Mars and Venus (volumes in a projected Romances of the Planets series that the author never continued) were precursors of popular planetary adventure novels of the twentieth century by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Otis Adelbert Kline, and other writers. The original edition of Journey to Venus from Arena Publishing Co. featured sixteen illustrations by \"Miss Fairfax and Mrs. McAuley.\" The ensuing \"paper-covered\" edition reduced the illustrations to three. After the 1896 bankruptcy of Arena Publishing, Journey to Venus was reprinted in 1897 by the New York firm F. T. Neely, with the reduced number of three illustrations."

The work is Straub's third novel and his second published novel, as Under Venus was not officially published until 1984. Straub began writing Julia at the advice of his literary agent after Under Venus was rejected by his publishers, as his agent recommended that he try writing a gothic novel."

  "text" : "An independent film adaptation of the novel, starring Maxwell Beer as Jeremy Fink and Ryan Simpkins as Lizzy Muldoun, was released in 2012. Writer/director Tamar Halpern adapted the book and directed. One month before his thirteenth birthday, Jeremy Fink and his best friend Lizzy Muldoon are hanging out in his New York City apartment when the mailman delivers a package addressed to Jeremy's mom. Lizzy convinces him to open the package. Inside the package, they discover a wooden box with four keyholes and the words, \"THE MEANING OF LIFE: FOR JEREMY FINK TO OPEN ON HIS 13TH BIRTHDAY.\" Jeremy immediately recognizes the box as the work of his father, who died five years earlier in a car crash. An accompanying note explains that the friend taking care of the box lost all of the keys. Determined to open the box, Jeremy and Lizzy contact a locksmith who explains that he is unable to pick the locks or break the box open without destroying the box and possibly its contents. The two friends set a goal to find the keys by the end of the summer so Jeremy can still open the box on his thirteenth birthday. Lizzy's impulsiveness gets the duo into trouble for destroying property and they must spend the summer performing community service. Jeremy and Lizzy are assigned to work for Mr. Oswald, an antique dealer preparing to retire to Florida, who sends them to deliver some special antiques. Once the first house is reached, the children realize they are returning items to the original owners, people who pawned these items when only teenagers. Each item is being returned with the original letter stating why the owner chose to pawn the item. The people Jeremy meets help him learn important lessons about life by sharing their views. While doing community service they must find all of the keys they can, continuously worrying about the performance they must do at a fair due to losing a bet to Jeremy's grandmother. It is only in the end that Jeremy truly understands the meaning of life when he opens the box."

It was among the top six bestsellers in cities across the United States in 1916, and in July 1916 it was the second bestselling novel. Originally published by Houghton Mifflin, it tells the story of a young boy, David, who must learn to adapt to living with others after the death of his recluse father; along the way, the villagers and his adoptive parents adapt as much or more to him. Though criticized by reviewers as \"mush\" and \"too perfectly lovely,\" the novel was very popular in the early half of the twentieth century in middle and high schools, and has recently seen a number of reprints. The novel was transcribed in Braille in 1922, and translated in Chinese (1959) and Russian (2005)."

  "text" : "Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them) is a book by Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This work includes a narrative of Ehrman's own progression in Biblical studies and beliefs, an overview of the issues raised by scholarly analysis of the Bible, details of a selection of findings from such analysis, and an exhortation regarding the importance of coming to understand the Bible more fully. Regarding the importance of Biblical study, Ehrman says in the preface, \"This kind of information is relevant not only to scholars like me, who devote their lives to serious research, but also to everyone who is interested in the Bible -- whether they personally consider themselves believers or not. In my opinion this really matters. Whether you are a believer -- fundamentalist, evangelical, moderate, liberal -- or a nonbeliever, the Bible is the most significant book in the history of our civilization. Coming to understand what it actually is, and is not, is one of the most important intellectual endeavors that anyone in our society can embark upon.\" One particular statement from early on appears to summarize the development of the subject matter that Ehrman attempts to cover in this volume: \"Scholars of the Bible have made significant progress in understanding the Bible over the past two hundred years, building on archaeological discoveries, advances in our knowledge of the ancient Hebrew and Greek languages in which the book of Scripture were originally written, and deep and penetrating historical, literary, and textual analyses.\""

  "text" : "Joker One: A Marine Platoon's Story of Courage, Leadership, and Brotherhood  is a memoir by Donovan Campbell, published by Random House in 2009. It is an account of Campbell's time as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps, focusing predominately on his 2004 deployment in Ramadi during the Iraq War. The book is named after the platoon Campbell commanded, the 1st Platoon Company G (also known as \"Golf Company\"), 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, known by its radio call sign, Joker One. Joker One arrived in Iraq in the early spring of 2004, and \"counted around 40 dudes: country boys and smalltown jocks; a few Hispanics and a single black. Some were college men with futures; some had pasts they preferred to forget. The battalion was assigned to one of Iraq’s worst hot spots: the city of Ramadi, where faceless enemies found shelter among 350,000 Iraqi civilians. Joker One fought from street to street, house to house and ambush to ambush for seven straight months.\" In his review for Leatherneck, Robert B. Loring notes: \"In early 2004, the Marines of “Golf” Co took over the city’s pacification and protection duties from the U.S. Army. The leathernecks aggressively patrolled the city streets and crowded alleyways. In the ensuing months the company did well, improving the tense relationships with the city’s Sunni population. Campbell writes, 'My job description was twofold: 1) save lives and 2) take lives.' In time, Ramadi earned the title of Iraq’s most dangerous place; however, the day-to-day struggle for the city soon was overshadowed by two headline-grabbing battles in another Sunni-dominated city: Fallujah. Campbell’s book centers on leading his 40-man platoon in combat. His prose vividly highlights his thinking process and the actions of his Marines. The rigors of actively patrolling the city and the constant house-to-house fighting in the face of IEDs, RPGs and AK fire as well as the threat of ambush presented endless challenges. Campbell speaks in detail of the daily tactics to overcome the threats and also the efforts to pacify the populace, gaining the support of the citizenry.\""

  "text" : "Jacob's Rescue is a 1994 children's book by Malka Drucker and Michael Halperin based on a true story that takes place in Warsaw, Poland during the Holocaust. A poor Polish family rescues Jacob and his brothers from the tyranny of the Nazis where they face the reality of life under the harshest conditions. They are in the current day and his daughter ask about the holocaust, Jacob had a flashback of this time. Two people that helped Jacob during the hardest times were here too. Michael Halperin discovered the story when he was told about two brothers who endured the hardships of the Holocaust. They were rescued by a Catholic Polish family who kept them safe under Nazi eyes and from Polish collaborators for over 4 years. At the end of World War Two, the brothers were reunited with their father who had fled to what was then known as Palestine. Both boys took their doctorates at the University of California Berkeley and returned to Israel. Halperin received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop a screenplay based on the story and that became the basis for \"Jacob's Rescue\". Alex and Mela Roslan who rescued Jacob and his brother David were honored by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles and have a garden planted in their honor on the Avenue of the Righteous at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, Halperin arranged for the Roslans to fly to Israel in order to celebrate Passover with Jacob and David. It was the first time all four were together since they said goodbye at a rail station in Berlin."

  "text" : "John Cotton's Birds of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales 1843-1849 is a book published by William Collins (Australia), in a limited edition of 850 copies. It catalogues the ornithological artwork of 19th century Australian settler John Cotton, along with biographical information about him, reproductions of selected sketches and paintings, and extracts from his journals. The 'Port Phillip District of New South Wales' in the book's title roughly corresponds geographically to the Australian state of Victoria which was only formed in 1851, shortly after Cotton's death. The book is 230 mm high by 324 mm wide and was issued in a slipcase. It was authored by Allan McEvey and contains a foreword by Alec H. Chisholm, as well as a biographical introduction by Cotton's great-granddaughter, Maie Casey, who also sponsored the production of the book. The book is a tribute to Cotton and his ornithological and artistic talents. After migrating from England to Australia and establishing himself and his family on a sheep station on the Goulburn River, he began to study, collect and sketch the birds there. However, his plans to produce a book on Victorian birds ultimately came to nothing through historical circumstance and his own early death three days before his 48th birthday, with his journals and artwork unpublished, scattered among his descendants and lost to the world for over 120 years. Of Cotton's talents as an artist, McEvey says:\"In his bird drawings his colouring is generally accurate, with some puzzling exceptions; his draughtsmanship ranges from the occasionally poor (his drawing of tails is sometimes weak), to the generally good and often excellent, and where he combines draughtsmanship, colour and a close knowledge of the species as, for example, in the White-faced Heron and Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater, he produced strikingly appealing drawings that are full of liveliness and character. One must remember that the drawings in general are preliminary sketches not finished work. In short his drawings of Australian birds are far superior to Lewin's, often better than many that have been made since, and display a genuine ability and an intimate acquaintance with the bird. They would have provided an excellent guide to common birds of south-eastern Australia at a time when only the expensive work by Gould and the inferior plates by Lewin were available.” The book was reviewed in the journal Emu by Roy Wheeler (as W.R.W.), who said: \"Cotton's information would never have been published were it not for the patience and dedication of his great-granddaughter, Maie Casey, wife of one of the great sons of this country, Lord Casey. She contacted relatives from all parts of the world and brought together the greater part of John Cotton's sketch-books, paintings and writings. These she then handed to Allan McEvey former President of the RAOU and Curator of Blrds at the National Museum of Victoria in Melbourne. Again with great dedication, he carefully examined and annotated the collection and from it has now produced this book. Including a catalogue of all the drawings in the possession of Lady Casey and fine reproductions at original size of a selection, this represents a most valuable contribution not only to Victorian ornithology but to Australian ornithology as well.\"There could be no one more suited to write the foreword than Alec Chisholm, OBE, Fellow of the RAOU and the greatest ornithological historian in this country. Lady Casey gives a very fine account of the family background and the struggle John Cotton had to get his brother, William, interested in his ornithological work.\"To me two interesting facts stand out in John Cotton's writings. On 11 May 1843 he wrote: 'We are approaching Cape Otway. A little bird with a flame red breast flew past the stern of the ship towards the land.' This was probably the first record of migration of the Flame Robin between Tasmania and Victoria. There is still no evidence from bird-banding of this migration in spite of hundreds of birds being banded in Victoria.\"The other concerns the Bell Miner. On 19 June 1843 when he crossed the King Parrot Creek, John Cotton wrote: 'Wherever there is running or constant water the bell bird may be heard uttering his sonorous clear \"tink\" which, from its similarity to the sound of a silver bell, when many are heard at the same time, is the origin of its name.' The Bell Miner has not been heard in that area for a very long time, possibly for more than a century.\"This book is a first-class piece of Australiana and should be in all libraries with a particular interest in early history; my congratulations to all concerned with this tribute to John Cotton.\""

In her final years, Murdoch suffered from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, one of the symptoms of which is a reduced vocabulary and decreased word fluency. Researchers at University College London found in 2004 that the language used in Jackson's Dilemma is noticeably simpler than in her earlier works. They suggested that the novel - written in longhand, with few revisions and little room for editorial interference - offers a \"unique opportunity\" to study the effects of Alzheimer's on spontaneous writing, and hoped that their research could help to develop better diagnostic tests, capable of picking up on these subtle changes in cognitive ability."

  "text" : "Jan’s Story: Love Lost to the Long Goodbye of Alzheimer's is a book by Barry Petersen in about his wife's battle with the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The book was published in June 2010. In this book, CBS News Correspondent Barry Petersen recounts his struggle as he takes on the role of caregiver for his wife, Jan. In 2005, at the age of only 55, Jan was diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease, a life-changing moment that led to their utter exhaustion and devastation, as together they fought against the insidious illness. Jan’s Story leads readers through the roller-coaster ride of emotions that evolved, intensified, and, at its climax, almost destroyed Barry as he realized that he was losing Jan. Not only is Jan’s Story a tribute to his beloved wife, but the book also poses a plethora of questions surrounding the actions and agony of being a caregiver, and what unfolds when one partner in a marriage is suddenly incapable of participating in the relationship. A portion of the author's royalties from the book will be donated to the national Alzheimer's Association and to the Alzheimer's Association of Colorado."

  "text" : "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971) is the first collection of poems by African-American writer and poet, Maya Angelou. Many of the poems in Diiie were originally song lyrics, written during Angelou's career as a night club performer, and recorded on two albums before the publication of Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). Angelou considers herself a poet and a playwright, but is best known for her seven autobiographies. She began, early in her writing career, of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention and are more interesting when read aloud. Diiie is made up of two sections of 38 poems. The 20 poems in the first section, \"Where Love is a Scream of Anguish\", center on love. Many of the poems in this section and the next are structured like blues and jazz music, and have universal themes of love and loss. The eighteen poems in the second section, \"Just Before the World Ends\", focus on the experience of the survival of African Americans despite living in a society dominated by whites. Angelou uses the vernacular of African Americans, irony, understatement, and humor to make her statements about race and racism in America. She acts as a spokesperson for her race in these poems, in which her use of irony and humor allows her to speak for the collective and to assume a distance in order to make comments about her themes, topics, and subjects. Critic Kathy M. Essick have called the poems in Diiie \"protest poems\". The metaphors in her poetry serve as \"coding\", or litotes, for meanings understood by other Blacks, although her themes and topics are universal for most readers to understand. Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie has received mixed reviews from critics, but was a best-seller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Many critics expected that the volume would be popular despite their negative reviews, but others considered it well written, lyrical, and a moving expression of social observation."

A spokesperson for Eason & Son was reported to have called it \"one of the most highly anticipated literary events of the year\". Tubridy was exempted from paying income tax on his work, leading to criticism from politicians and the media. The broadcaster said he would send copies of the book to both the Kennedy family and the White House. The book contains photographs of Kennedy's visit. A documentary, JFK: A Homecoming, by Ryan Tubridy was broadcast on RTÉ One prior to the book's release. Bernice Harrison, reviewing the week's television in The Irish Times, commented: \"The timing of this history documentary – not the usual bank-holiday viewing, not an anniversary of the visit, no new revelations – was peculiar until you noted that RTÉ's star presenter has a book coming out this week about the JFK visit. Nice publicity if you can get it\"."

As well as this the book explains Torvalds' view of himself, the free software movement and the development of Linux. Just for Fun has been translated into numerous languages including the first official language of Torvalds's home country Finnish, and later to his own first language Swedish (Torvalds is a member of the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland).

  "text" : "Judith Hearne (later republished as The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne), was regarded by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore as his first novel. The book was published in 1955, after Moore had left Ireland and was living in Canada. It was rejected by ten American publishers before being accepted by a British publisher. Diana Athill's memoir, Stet (2000), has information about the publishing of Judith Hearne. Set in Belfast in the 1950s, Judith Hearne has been described as \"a sensitive study of a middle-aged alcoholic woman in drab Belfast and her desperate last attempts at finding love and companionship\". Ann Leary, reviewing the book for NPR, calls it \"a short book about a lifetime of longing\" and says \"Moore uses brilliant economy in his writing; it's as if words are as scarce and precious as sunshine in this gloomy section of postwar Belfast\". According to Colm Tóibín, the book \"is full of Joycean moments... it takes from ‘Clay’, the most mysterious story in Dubliners, the idea of a single, middle-aged woman visiting a family and finding both comfort and humiliation there\". Robert Fulford, writing in Canada's The Globe and Mail, describes it as \"a bleak post-Catholic novel\" that depicts \"a desolate life, stripped of warming humanity\". Moore won the Authors' Club First Novel Award and the Beta Sigma Phi award for this work, although it was not his first novel. A film based on the book, but with the story relocated to Dublin, was released in 1987 with Maggie Smith in the title role. The book was republished by HarperCollins, under the title The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, on 16 July 2007 in the Harper Perennial Modern Classics series (ISBN 0007255616; ISBN 978-0007255610)."

  "text" : "John Henry, an American Legend is a 1965 children's picture book by American author and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats In this book, It shows that John Henry, a hard working miner tries to beat the steam drill. He used a 20 pound hammer against a steam drill. Whoever won would get 100 dollars and new clothes. In the end John Henry won the competitionbut he also broke inside. He puts his hammer on top of his chest and dies in honor. \"A man ain't nothin' but a man\". Disney retold the story in Disney's American Legends. In the story, John Henry was born into slavery but when he and his wife were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, his wife had their chains forged into a 20 pound hammer. John used the hammer to join with railroad workers who were told if they finished building the railroad line they would be rewarded with land of their own. The workers are replaced by a steam drill, which causes their contracts for land to be voided. John challenges the drill to a contest of speed to lay the rest of the tracks, and if he wins, the workers will still get the land. He inevitably wins but the effort kills him, and he dies with his hammer in his hand, like he told his wife he would. The story was narrated by his wife to their child after John's death."

  "text" : "Jerusalem (/dʒəˈruːsələm/; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם  [jeruʃaˈlajim]; Arabic: القُدس‎‎  [alˈqʊds]), is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was called \"Urusalima\" in the ancient cuneiform, meaning \"City of Peace\", during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). Significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Israelis and Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital, as the State of Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there while the State of Palestine ultimately foresees the city as its seat of power; however, neither claim is widely recognized internationally. During its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David was settled in the 4th millennium BCE.In 1538, walls were built around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent. Today those walls define the Old City, which has been traditionally divided into four quarters—known since the early 19th century as the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters.The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Modern Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. According to the Biblical tradition, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First Temple. These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (עיר הקודש, transliterated ‘ir haqodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Septuagint which Christians adopted as their own authority, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion there. In Sunni Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina.In Islamic tradition in 610 CE it became the first qibla, the focal point for Muslim prayer (salat),and Muhammad made his Night Journey there ten years later, ascending to heaven where he speaks to God, according to the Quran.As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 square kilometres (0.35 sq mi),the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount and its Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Dome of the Rock, the Garden Tomb and al-Aqsa Mosque. Today, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into Jerusalem, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the Prime Minister and President, and the Supreme Court. Whilst the international community rejected the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel, Israel has a stronger claim to sovereignty over West Jerusalem. The international community does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and the city hosts no foreign embassies. Jerusalem is also home to some non-governmental Israeli institutions of national importance, such as the Hebrew University and the Israel Museum with its Shrine of the Book. In 2011, Jerusalem had a population of 801,000, of which Jews comprised 497,000 (62%), Muslims 281,000 (35%), Christians 14,000 (around 2%) and 9,000 (1%) were not classified by religion."

  "text" : "Jesus (/ˈdʒiːzəs/ JEE-zuss Greek: Ἰησοῦς, translit. Iesous; Hebrew: ישוע‎, translit. Yēšū́aʿ, lit. 'Yeshua; \"He saves\"'‎; c. 4 BC – c. AD 30), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who has become the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ, the Anointed One) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, and they consider the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) to be the best sources for investigating the historical Jesus, although not everything in the New Testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Often referred to as \"rabbi\", Jesus preached his message orally, was baptized by John the Baptist, was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God's will, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After Jesus' death, his followers believed he was resurrected, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. His birth is celebrated annually on December 25 (or various dates in January for some eastern churches) as a holiday known as Christmas, his crucifixion is honored on Good Friday, and his resurrection is celebrated on Easter. The widely used calendar era \"AD\", from the Latin \"Anno Domini\" (\"in the year of our Lord\"), and the alternative \"CE\", are based on the birth of Jesus. Christians believe that Jesus has a \"unique significance\" in the world. Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, whence he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology; though some believe Jesus's role as savior has more existential or societal concerns than the afterlife, and a few notable theologians have suggested that Jesus will bring about a universal reconciliation. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets and the Messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin but was not the Son of God. The Quran states that Jesus himself never claimed divinity. To most Muslims, Jesus was not crucified but was physically raised into Heaven by God. Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that his death on the cross signifies that he was rejected by God and that his resurrection is a Christian legend."

  "text" : "Jataka Tattva is a standard treatise on the predictive part of Hindu astrology and follows the Parashari System. It is written in Sanskrit. Its author has adopted the Sutra method for imparting knowledge of astrology instead of the traditional Sloka format. A great deal of importance is given to Medicine and Astrology. The author of this text, Mahadeva, son of Revashankar Pathak, hailed from Ratlam, Rajasthan, he was a devotee of Goddess Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva and well-versed in medicine, Sanskrit and Jyotisha. Mahadeva is believed to have lived from 1842 to 1888. He had written this treatise with the assistance of Vishnushastri, and completed its writing on Phalguna Shukla Panchami Vikram Samvat 1928 (on 14 March 1874 ). The brevity of the sutras employed to describe lengthy original passages culled from other texts is noteworthy. His son, Shriniwas Mahadeva Sharma translated this text into Hindi which translation with commentary was published in 1913. The earliest translation of this text into English appears to be that of V.Subramanya Sastri which was published in 1941 by V.B.Soobbiah and Sons, Bangalore. Jataka Tattva comprises five tatvas or sections, namely, Samjna, Sutika, Prakirna, Strijataka, and Dasha. These five then are further divided into 13 sub-sections. Some say it can be used to diagnose medical ailments, in addition to reading the dasha effects. In his book titled - Light on Life: An introduction to the Astrology of India, Hart de Fouw has cited Jataka Tattva"

  "text" : "Jataka Bharanam  is an old treatise on Hindu astrology mainly dealing with the Phalita i.e. predictive astrology.

It is one of the many time honoured important Indian Classics on astrology  that has been relied upon and frequently cited. This book, written in the usual Sanskrit verse-format and comprising 1744 verses divided into 26 adhyayas, minutely covers the entire ambit of Jyotisa.

These are followed by yogas taking the Sun and the Moon as factors (18 verses), Sanyasa yogas (11 verses), Arishta yogas (51 verses), Arishtabhangadhyaya (15 verses), and Sarvagraharishtadhyaya (21 verses). This book also deals with Rasi Dashas (147 verses), Mahadashadhyaya (13 verses) and Antradashadhyaya (74 verses). Thereafter, it covers Danas (10 verses), Nashjatakadhyaya (14 verses), Death (112 verses) and Strijataka (32 verses).

  "text" : "Jataka Parijata  is an Indian astrological text that is ranked alongside Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra of Parāśara Muni, Bṛhat Jātaka of Varāhamihira and Phaladīpikāḥ of Mantreśvara.  It is regularly studied as a textbook and a reliable reference-book, and is one of the few books that gives time on the nativity, the other two being Horā Ratnaṃ and Jātaka Bharaṇaṃ. Jataka Parijata (Devanāgarī: जातक पारिजात, IAST: jātaka pārijāta) is written in Sanskrit in the usual Śloka-format. Its author, Vaidyanātha Dīkṣita, was probably born c.1425-1450.  Many noted scholars and authors like - V.Subramanya Sastri, G.S.Kapoor, Gopesh Kumar Ojha, Bangalore Venkata Raman,  Bepin Behari, Gayatri Vasudev,  S.S.Chaterjee,  Ernst Wilhelm, Hart De Fouw, Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Komilla Sutton - have translated and written commentaries on Jataka Parijata beside referring to its contents in their own works. Jātaka Pārijāta, according to Gopesh Kumar Ojha, was completed in the year 1347 Śaka/1482 Vikram Saṃvat i.e. in the year 1426 A.D. It is based on various earlier works such as Garga Horā, Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra, Śrīpati-Paddhati, Sārāvalī, Bṛhat Jātaka, Sarvārtha Cintāmaṇi etc. Its author, Vaidyantha,who was a devotee of Ranganatha (Lord Viṣṇu) and lived in South India in Karṇāṭaka or Andhra, belonged to the Bharadvāja Gotra and was the son of Veṅkaṭadri. Some scholars are of the opinion that Vaidyanātha is the same person who wrote Prataprudriya. Keśava Daivajṅa, the author of Keśava Jātaka and Muhūrta-Tattva, was his disciple. Jātaka Pārijāta has Eighteen chapters viz. I: Prathamo'dhyāyaḥ – Rāśiśīlādhyāyaḥ (61 verses) or Chapter on forms of Signs, II: Dvitīyo'dhyāyaḥ – Grahasvarūpaguṇādhyāyaḥ (87 verses) or Chapter on nature of Planets, III: Tṛtīyo'dhyāyaḥ – Viyonyādijanmādhyāya (80 verses) or Chapter on Births, IV: Caturtho'dhyāyaḥ – Bālāriṣṭādhyāyaḥ (107 verses) or Chapter on Early Death, V: Pañcamoyo'dhyāyaḥ – Āyurdāyādhyāyaḥ (124 verses) or Chapter on Longevity, VI: Tṛtīyo'dhyāyaḥ – Jātakabhaṅgādhyāyaḥ (102 verses) or Chapter on Miseries and set-backs, VII – Rājayogādhyāyaḥ (181 verses) or Chapter on gain of Rulership and ruling powers, VIII – Dviyadigrhayogādhyāyaḥ (118 verses) or Chapter on Conjunction etc., of two or more planets, IX – Mandyabdadiphaladhyaya (129 verses) or Chapter on the role of Māndi etc., X – Aṣṭakavargādhyāyaḥ (72 verses) or Chapter on Aṣṭakavarga system, XI – Prathamadvityābhāvaphalādhyāyaḥ (96 verses) or Chapter on nature and results on account of planetary influence etc.,of the Lagna and the 2nd house, XII – Tṛtyācaturthabhāvaphalādhyāyaḥ (144 verses) or Chapter on nature and results on account of planetary influence etc.,of the 3rd and the 4th house, XIII – Pañcamaṣaṣṭhabhāvaphalādhyāyaḥ (82 verses) or Chapter on nature and results on account of planetary influence etc.,of the 5th and the 6th house, XIV – Saptamāṣṭamnavamabhāvaphalādhyāyaḥ (103 verses) or Chapter on nature and results on account of planetary influence etc.,of the 7th, the 8th and the 9th house, XV – Daśamekādaśādvādaśabhāvaphalādhyāyaḥ (83 verses) or Chapter on nature and results on account of planetary influence etc.,of the 10th, 11th and the 12th house, XVI – Strījātakādhyāyaḥ (54 verses) or Chapter on Female horoscopy, XVII – Kālacakradaśādhyāya (111 verses) or Chapter on Kālacakradaśā calculation and results and XVIII – Daśāphalādhyāyaḥ (172+4 verses) Chapter on Uḍudaśās. These eighteen chapters said to originally contain 1763 ślokas, due to interpolations now consisting of 1910 or 1918 verses, cover the entire range of Hindu astrology based on Parāśarian principles. Like Bṛhat Jātaka, Jātaka Pārijāta is a condensation of more ancient Hora texts and some later important works including Bṛhat Jātaka."

  "text" : "Jatakalankara is a brief Sanskrit treatise comprising one hundred twenty-five slokas or verses on the predictive part of Hindu astrology written in the classic Sloka format in the Srgdhara meter. It was written by Poet Ganesa, son of Gopal Das (who was the second son of Kanhaji, and who was himself an accompalished poet, dramatist, artist and mathematician), in the year 1613 and describes many yoga-formations that have immediate bearing on various aspects of human life. Ganesha wrote this treatise to please his Guru Shiva Its first translation into English was probably published, along with the original text, in 1941 by Sri Vijay Lakshmi Vilas Press. Ganesa examined the planetary influences on the health of individuals while observing that ritualistic remedia scriptures, medical and astronomico-astrological texts of instruction are propitiable as well as religious scriptures.. At the International Sanskrit Conference it was brought on record that Ganesa, son of Gopala, wrote this treatise in Vrddhapura (Vadanagara). This work describing numerous planetary combinations yogas, some unique, some auspicious and other inauspicious, is divided into seven Adhyayas or chapters, viz – 1) Sangyadhyaya (12 stanzas) dealing with preliminaries, 2) Bhavadhyaya (38 stanzas) dealing with nature, characteristics and results of 12 bhavas i.e. houses, 3) Yogadhyaya (34 stanzas) dealing with planetary combinations and their results, 4) Vishakanyadhyaya (4 stanzas) dealing with combinations which indicate birth of Vishakanyas (inauspicious women), 5) Ayurdayadhyaya (23 stanzas) dealing with longevity, 6) Vaiparityasthadhyaya (9 stanzas) dealing with mutual exchange of signs by planets, and 7) Vanshadhyaya (5 stanzas) dealing with basic information about this text and its author. Its author, Ganesa, belonging to the Bhardwaja Gotra, was the son of Gopaldas. He wrote and completed this work in a village named Suryapur in the month of Bhadrapada Saka year 1536 or 1613"

  "text" : "(\"Theory of Justice\" redirects here. For the book, see A Theory of Justice. For other uses, see Justice (disambiguation).) Justice is the legal or philosophical theory by which fairness is administered. The concept of justice differs in every culture. An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work The Republic. Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and argue that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called \"reparative justice\") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders."

  "text" : "Jinakālamālī (Burmese: ဇိနကာလမာလီ; Thai: ชินกาลมาลีปกรณ์; rtgs: Chinnakanmalipakon; lit. \"The Sheaf of Garlands of the Epochs of the Conqueror\") is a Chiang Mai chronicle that covers mostly about religious history, and contains a section on early Lan Na kings to 1516/1517. Similar period Pali chronicles include the Chamadevivamsa and the Mulasasana. Originally written in Pali by a Buddhist monk, it is said to have been completed in 1527 but the oldest extant manuscript dates only to 1788. The chronicle was one of the Chiang Mai-based chronicles maintained during the Burmese rule of Lan Na (1558–1775) and it was referenced by later Burmese chronicles, most notably Maha Yazawin, the standard chronicle of Toungoo Dynasty. The oldest extant manuscript of 1788 is written in a late Khmer script, and has gone through at least a dozen revisions. It was translated to Khmer and translated \"from Khmer to Thai to Pali to French and back again to Pali.\" The chronicle was revised at least four times during the Chakri Dynasty. The Thai language version by King Mongkut's reign was no longer a verbatim copy of the 1788 copy, having incorporated early Thai nationalist narratives. It was finally translated into English in 1968 by N.A. Jayawickrama. Thus, the English version today is a \"compendium of knowledge of several different ages and places, rather than of a singular time and place.\" The chronicle continues to be of interest to Burma scholars. In its \"secular section\" about early kings, the chronicle extols most about the conquests of King Anawrahta of Pagan Dynasty. The author credits Anawrahta's role as a great Buddhist king into bringing Theravada Buddhism to present-day northern Thailand. It is the first historical text of Southeast Asia to mention Anawrahta's conquest of a kingdom held by one Manohara, which British colonial period historians translated to King Manuha of Thaton Kingdom. However, Michael Aung-Thwin points out the author merely mentions \"here itself in the Rammanna Country\", which was more likely Haripunjaya, the Mon kingdom that existed before Lan Na."

  "text" : "Judaism Without Embellishment was an Anti-Semitic book published in 1963 by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The book was written by Trofim Kichko, who worked at the Academy, who had past associations with Nazi Germany. The book argued that a worldwide Jewish conspiracy existed, that the Jewish people were attempting to subvert the Soviet Union, and had played a role in the 1941 Nazi-German invasion of the country. The book was illustrated throughout with caricatures depicting Jewish people in a stereotypical and prejudice manner, very similar to those that had been seen in Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda. While the work was initially hailed as scientific work of distinction in analyzing the Jewish population of the Soviet Union and distributed for educational purposes across the nation, it was met with hostility from the international community. The work was condemned across Europe and the United States, leading to protests in Scandinavia when General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev toured the region. Communists parties, within Europe and America, also attacked the work and called for the Soviet Government to withdraw its support for the work and it from circulation. Under intense international pressure, the Soviet Government withdrew its support, and destroyed all copies. As a result, Trofim Kichko fell out of favor with the Government. While the book was destroyed, similar works continued to be published and several years later Kichko - having returned to grace - published a second anti-Semitic work. Historians agree that Trofim Kichko was working under instructions of the central Government, and that his work was the beginning of a new wave of Government-sponsored anti-Semitism within the larger structure of the Soviet Union's attack on religion. Furthermore, historians see the work as a Soviet attempt to cause friction between the Jewish and Ukrainian populations, which backfired."

Kennedy. The book is drawn from many sources, including the Warren Report. The book's central thesis is that Kennedy was a cold warrior who turned to peace-making, and that as a result he was killed by his own security apparatus. Published by The Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers' Orbis Books, it received an award from the Catholic Press Association and coverage in the religious press; sales shot up after Oliver Stone recommended the book, with it featuring in Amazon.com's Top 100 for a week. The 2013 edition of the book was endorsed by Kennedy's nephew Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who said it had moved him to visit Dealey Plaza for the first time."

Binks in the title is an aside to the Star Wars CGI character who was poorly received, the title gives voice to the extent of the lack of warmth his negative critics had over the controversy raised by Binks' characterization and what it was felt to engender. The collection was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2012. Although it tied for first in nominations for eligible works, it placed fifth in the final voting. The essays originally appeared in such publications as Artemis Magazine, The Internet Review of Science Fiction, Clarkesworld and Space & Time."

AD 30), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who has become the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ, the Anointed One) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, and they consider the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) to be the best sources for investigating the historical Jesus, although not everything in the New Testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Often referred to as \"rabbi\", Jesus preached his message orally, was baptized by John the Baptist, was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God's will, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After Jesus' death, his followers believed he was resurrected, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. His birth is celebrated annually on December 25 (or various dates in January for some eastern churches) as a holiday known as Christmas, his crucifixion is honored on Good Friday, and his resurrection is celebrated on Easter. The widely used calendar era \"AD\", from the Latin \"Anno Domini\" (\"in the year of our Lord\"), and the alternative \"CE\", are based on the birth of Jesus. Christians believe that Jesus has a \"unique significance\" in the world. Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, whence he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology; though some believe Jesus's role as savior has more existential or societal concerns than the afterlife, and a few notable theologians have suggested that Jesus will bring about a universal reconciliation. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets and the Messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin but was not the Son of God. The Quran states that Jesus himself never claimed divinity. To most Muslims, Jesus was not crucified but was physically raised into Heaven by God. Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that his death on the cross signifies that he was rejected by God and that his resurrection is a Christian legend."

In order to prepare himself for his intended future, he insists on speaking only English and will eat only bacon and eggs for breakfast, though he is prepared to accept Thai dishes at other meals. In this peculiar situation the boy finds himself between three worlds, the Thai world of his family and his regal ancestors and their apparently pointless rituals, the western world of logic and common sense which he finds more compatible with his temperament and the imaginary world of his sheltered childhood. Imagining himself to be a great scholar and philosopher, Justin enlists the aid of an African American boy and the family gardener's son and sets out to convert his school classmates from their ingrained bigotry and racism."

  "text" : "John Keats (/ˈkiːts/; 31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821) was an English Romantic poet. He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death. Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets. He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers. Jorge Luis Borges stated that his first encounter with Keats's work was the most significant literary experience of his life. The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the series of odes. This is typical of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through the emphasis of natural imagery. Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature."

The first French edition was published in 1952 by Gallimard. The first English version, translated from the French by Gerard Hopkins, was published in 1955 by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK and in 1956 by Simon & Schuster in the US. It was first printed in three volumes, as the novel is over nine-hundred pages long. The novel is referred to as a precursor to Proust's most significant work, À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time) both thematically and in its plot, although it is more plainly autobiographical than Proust's later works."

According to one critic \"there is a touch of Wodehouse about the dialogue, though Mr. Timms is guilty sometimes of hanging on too long. Wodehouse knows just how far to exploit nonsense in dialogue; Mr. Timms has still much to learn about it.\" The critic from the Sydney Morning Herald stated that: This is not Mr. Timms in his best vein. Indeed, it is a novel-which will disappoint not only those old readers who found his historical stories so enjoyable, but also any new ones who expect to find in this book some justification for all the praise they have heard of his earlier work. He has tried to write a combination of humorous novel and thriller, and has fallen between two stools. The humour is unfunny and repetitive, and the espionage part of the story is about as convincing as would be a story written around an English rural deanery by an Eskimo who had never left his Arctic homeland. \"James, How Dare You\" would seem to have been tossed off quickly to catch a market. This is unfortunate. Mr. Timms has done and can do a great deal better."
