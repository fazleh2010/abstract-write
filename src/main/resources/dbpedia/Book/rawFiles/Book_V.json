  "text" : "Vanity Fair is an English novel by William Makepeace Thackeray which follows the lives of Becky Sharp and Emmy Sedley amid their friends and families during and after the Napoleonic Wars. It was first published as a 19-volume monthly serial from 1847 to 1848, carrying the subtitle Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Life, reflecting both its satirisation of early 19th-century British society and the many illustrations drawn by Thackeray to accompany the text. It was published as a single volume in 1848 with the subtitle A Novel without a Hero, reflecting Thackeray's interest in deconstructing his era's conventions regarding literary heroism. It is sometimes considered the \"principal founder\" of the Victorian domestic novel. The story is framed as a puppet play and the narrator, despite being an authorial voice, is notoriously unreliable. Late in the narrative, it is revealed that the entire account has been 2nd- or 3rd-hand gossip the writer picked up \"years ago\" from Lord Tapeworm, British charge d'affaires one of the minor German states and relative of several of the other aristocrats in the story but none of the main characters: \"the famous little Becky puppet\", \"the Amelia Doll\", \"the Dobbin Figure\", \"the Little Boys\", and \"the Wicked Nobleman, on which no expense has been spared\". Despite her many stated faults and still worse ones admitted to have been passed over in silence, Becky emerges as the \"hero\"—what is now called an antihero—in place of Amelia because Thackeray is able to illustrate that \"the highest virtue a fictional character can possess is interest.\" The serial was a popular and critical success; the novel is now considered a classic and has inspired several film adaptations. In 2003, Vanity Fair was listed at #122 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's best-loved books."

  "text" : "Virginia (1913) is a novel by Ellen Glasgow about a wife and mother who in vain seeks happiness by serving her family. This novel, her eleventh, marked a clear departure from Glasgow's previous work—she had written a series of bestsellers before publishing Virginia—in that it attacked, in a subtle yet unmistakable way, the very layer of society that constituted her readership. Also, as its heroine, though virtuous and god-fearing, is denied the happiness she is craving, its plot did not live up to readers' expectations as far as poetic justice is concerned and was bound to upset some of them. Today, Virginia is seen by many as an outstanding achievement in Glasgow's career, exactly because the author defied literary convention by questioning the foundations of American society around the dawn of the 20th century, be it capitalism, religion or racism."

  "text" : "Vacuum Diagrams is a collection of science fiction short stories written by Stephen Baxter. The collection connects the novels of the Xeelee Sequence and also shows the history of mankind in the Xeelee universe, and ultimately the universe. While each short story in the collection is self-contained, the stories are presented as being contained in the context of the first story, Eve, about a man who is forced to witness the events in the short stories by a god-like being. Eve acts as a structure for the short stories, with an introduction at the beginning of Vacuum Diagrams, short scenes occurring between each \"era\" (with \"Eve\" character explaining and introducing the next section), and an ending that wraps up the plot for the Eve story itself. Vacuum Diagrams won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1999. At the end of the collection, a chronology of the Xeelee Sequence is provided. Every short story and book from the cycle (up to 1997) is noted, with notable events from each story plotted Vacuum Diagrams contains the following stories (all previously published except for \"Eve\"): Prologue: EveERA: Expansion \n*  \"The Sun-People\" (published 1993) \n*  \"The Logic Pool\" (1994) \n*  \"Gossamer\" (1995) \n*  \"Cilia-of-Gold\" (1994) \n*  \"Lieserl\" (1993)ERA: Squeem Occupation \n*  \"Pilot\" (1993) \n*  \"The Xeelee Flower\" (1987) \n*  \"More Than Time or Distance\" (1988) \n*  \"The Switch\" (1990)ERA: Qax Occupation \n*  \"Blue Shift\" (1989) \n*  \"The Quagma Datum\" (1989) \n*  \"Planck Zero\" (1992)ERA: Assimilation \n*  \"The Gödel Sunflowers\" (1992) \n*  \"Vacuum Diagrams\" (1990)ERA: The War to End Wars \n*  \"Stowaway\" (1991) \n*  \"The Tyranny of Heaven\" (1990) \n*  \"Hero\" (1995)ERA: Flight \n*  \"Secret History\" (1991)ERA: Photino Victory \n*  \"Shell\" (1987) \n*  \"The Eighth Room\" (1989) \n*  \"The Baryonic Lords\" (1991)Epilogue: Eve Vacuum Diagrams is also the title of the fifteenth short story by Stephen Baxter in his anthology-science fiction novel of the same title. It was originally published in Interzone in 1990. The title \"Vacuum Diagrams\" refers to the violation and reassertion of the uncertainty principle in our universe. Set in A.D. 21124, the story concerns the main character's attempt and failure to terraform a colony due to its upset of the agenda of the galactic-scale builders known as the Xeelee."

  "text" : "Valley of the Dolls is a novel by American writer Jacqueline Susann, published in 1966. The \"dolls\" within the title is a euphemism for pills, and was created by Susann. The term represents the women's reliance on stimulants, depressants, and sleeping pills, and how substance abuse is reminiscent of children clinging to toy dolls for comfort. An overnight success when it was first published, Valley of the Dolls became the bestselling work of fiction of 1966. Since then it has sold more than 30 million copies, making it one of the bestselling books of all time. As the first roman à clef by a female author to achieve this level of sales in America, it led the way for other authors such as Jackie Collins to depict the private lives of the real-life rich and famous under a veneer of fiction. The 1997 reissue by Grove Press calls the book \"The All-Time Pop-Culture Classic\" on its back cover."

A growing body of research and applications based on Verbal Behavior has occurred since its original publication, particularly in the past decade. In addition, a growing body of research has developed on structural topics in verbal behavior such as grammar."

It was composed in French beginning in 1782, and then translated into English by Reverend Samuel Henley in which form it was first published in 1786 without Beckford's name as An Arabian Tale, From an Unpublished Manuscript, claiming to be translated directly from Arabic. The first French edition, titled simply as Vathek, was published in December 1786 (postdated 1787). In the twentieth century some editions include The Episodes of Vathek (Vathek et ses épisodes), three related tales intended by Beckford to be so incorporated, but omitted from the original edition and published separately long after his death."

The characters are generally the wealthy and disaffected, or people who make a living off them, as well as parasites of various kinds. In the preface, Ballard himself wrote: \"Vermilion Sands has more than its full share of dreams and illusions, fears and fantasies, but the frame for them is less confining. I like to think, too, that it celebrates the neglected virtues of the glossy, lurid and bizarre.\" A Times Literary Supplement review aptly describes the collection's surrealist mood : \"J.G. Ballard is … one of the most accomplished creators of evocative landscapes in modern fiction … he achieves this effect partly by painting his desert in the manner of Dali, a mixture of appalling clarity and the exotic.\""

  "text" : "Venus on the Half-Shell is a science fiction novel by Philip José Farmer, writing pseudonymously as \"Kilgore Trout\", a fictional recurring character in many of the novels of Kurt Vonnegut. This book first appeared as a lengthy fictitious \"excerpt\"—written by Vonnegut, but attributed to Trout—in Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965). With Vonnegut's permission, Farmer expanded the fragment into an entire standalone novel (including, as an in-joke, a scene that incorporates all of Vonnegut's original text). Farmer's story was first published in two parts beginning in the December 1974 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. The plot, in which Earth is destroyed by cosmic bureaucrats doing routine maintenance and the sole human survivor goes on a quest to find the \"Definitive Answer to the Ultimate Question,\" was paid homage by the later Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. According to Farmer's introduction in Venus on the Half-Shell and Others, Vonnegut was initially reluctant to allow the project, but finally relented. After publication, a poorly worded magazine article gave Vonnegut the impression that Farmer had planned to write the story regardless of his permission, which angered Vonnegut. Also, it was popularly assumed that Vonnegut wrote the book. This problem was solved by the book being reprinted under Farmer's by-line. A common element to this novel is the origin of many of the characters' and locations' names. Farmer \"put in a lot of references to literature and fictional authors... Most of the alien names in Venus were formed by transposing the letters of English or non-English words.\" The title and paperback cover art are a reference to an Italian Renaissance tempera painting by Sandro Botticelli, The Birth of Venus, which depicts the birth of the goddess Venus as her rising from the sea on a scallop shell. In 2013, Titan Books reprinted Venus on the Half-Shell with new cover art referencing The Birth of Venus."

  "text" : "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation is an 1844 work of speculative natural history and philosophy by Robert Chambers. Published anonymously in England, it brought together various ideas of stellar evolution with the progressive transmutation of species in an accessible narrative which tied together numerous scientific theories of the age. Vestiges was initially well received by polite Victorian society and became an international bestseller, but its unorthodox themes contradicted the natural theology fashionable at the time and were reviled by clergymen – and subsequently by scientists who readily found fault with its amateurish deficiencies. The ideas in the book were favoured by Radicals, but its presentation remained popular with a much wider public. Prince Albert read it aloud to Queen Victoria in 1845. Vestiges caused a shift in popular opinion which – Charles Darwin believed – prepared the public mind for the scientific theories of evolution by natural selection which followed from the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859. For decades there was speculation about its authorship. The 12th edition, published in 1884, revealed officially that the author was Robert Chambers, a Scottish journalist, who had written the book in St Andrews between 1841 and 1844 while recovering from a psychiatric illness. Initially, Chambers had proposed the title The Natural History of Creation, but friends persuaded him to revise the title in deference to the Scottish geologist James Hutton, who had remarked of the timeless aspect of geology: \"no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end\". Some of the inspiration for the work derived from the Edinburgh Phrenological Society whose materialist influence reached a climax between 1825 and 1840. George Combe, the leading proponent of phrenological thinking, had published his influential The Constitution of Man in 1828. Chambers was closely involved with Combe's associates William A.F. Browne and Hewett Cottrell Watson who did much to spell out the materialist theory of the mind. Chambers died in 1871 and is buried in the grounds of St Andrews Cathedral, within the ancient chapel of St Regulus."

  "text" : "Voyage in the Dark was written in 1934 by Jean Rhys. It tells of the semi-tragic descent of its young protagonist Anna Morgan, who is moved from her Caribbean home to England by an uncaring stepmother, after the death of her father. Once she leaves school, and she is cut off financially by the stepmother, Hester, Anna tries to support herself as a chorus girl, then becomes involved with an older man named Walter who supports her financially. When he leaves her, she begins a downward spiral. Like William Faulkner's The Wild Palms, the novel features a botched illegal abortion. Rhys' original version of ''Voyage in the Dark ended with Anna dying from this abortion (see Bonnie Kime Scott's The Gender of Modernism for the original ending), but she revised it before publication to the more ambivalent and modernist ending in which Anna survives to return to her now-shattered life \"all over again.\" The novel is rich in Caribbean folklore and tradition and post-colonial identity politics, including black self-identification by its white protagonist."

  "text" : "Vivian Grey is Benjamin Disraeli's first novel, published by Henry Colburn in 1826. Originally published anonymously, ostensibly by a so-called \"man of fashion,\" part 1 caused a considerable sensation in London society. Contemporary reviewers, suspicious of the numerous solecisms contained within the text, eventually identified the young Disraeli (who did not move in high society) as the author. Disraeli continued the tale in a second volume, also of 1826, and three subsequent volumes in 1827. The form in which Vivian Grey is published now is the revised 1853 edition, which was severely expurgated and, according to critic Wendy Burton, lost much of the charm and freshness of the 1826 edition. The book is a frequent touchstone for discussions of Disraeli's political and literary career."

It describes the coming of age of a young musician who signs on to the crew of a starship as a way of escaping from a failed romance. Robinson posted a note on his website in 2009 noting that his agent had sold a trilogy of sequels based on the novel and its characters."

  "text" : "Vendetta for the Saint is a 1964 mystery novel featuring the character of Simon Templar, alias \"The Saint\". The novel is credited to Leslie Charteris, who created the Saint in 1928, but the book was actually authored by Harry Harrison, a noted science fiction author who also wrote the syndicated Saint comic strip. Although Harrison wrote the majority of the book as a ghost writer, he indicates in an interview that Charteris did contribute to the final book (albeit in a very minor way).. The reference work The Saint: A Complete History by Burl Barer, however, indicates that Charteris was heavily involved in editing the book. This was the first Saint volume published after Charteris chose to step back from actively writing the adventures and would be followed by a number of books credited to Charteris but actually written by other authors. Charteris remained as editor of the books, approving stories and revising material when needed. These books would be mostly based upon teleplays from the TV series or scenarios from the comic strip; the next wholly original Saint literary stories wouldn't be published until the novella collection Catch the Saint more than a decade later. Vendetta for the Saint was the first full-length Saint novel published since The Saint Sees it Through was published 18 years earlier. In 1969 a television adaptation of the novel (see below for details) was released as a theatrical film, also entitled Vendetta for the Saint."

The Vivekachudamani describes developing Viveka, the human faculty of discrimination or discernment between real (unchanging, eternal) and unreal (changing, temporal), as the central task in the spiritual life, and calls it the crown jewel among the essentials for Moksha. The title Vivekachudamani translates to Crest Jewel of Discrimination. Through the centuries, the Vivekachudamani has been translated into several languages and has been the topic of many commentaries and expositions."

The main pew edition of Voices United includes full words and music to more than 700 hymns by Canadian and international writers, as well as responses, psalms, scripture songs, canticles, prayers, communion settings, service music, creeds, and John Wesley's \"Directions for Singing.\" There is also a words-only edition, a music director's edition with annotations, and electronic versions. VU is the third hymnbook produced by the United Church, following the 1930 Hymnary and the 1972 Hymn Book (the latter created jointly with the Anglican Church in Canada). It includes hymns from the 1972 book, as well as some that were included in 1930 and dropped in 1972 but never abandoned by congregations. Many of the older hymns have been edited line by line and sometimes word by word, to make their language more comprehensible to modern worshippers and more applicable to the Canadian context, and to remove language that would suggest that God is male or that all of humanity is male. The expression \"Lord\", for example, is rare in VU hymns, although it can be found, and there are also hymns that envision God in female terms. Only a few long-established hymns, those that have been in use since the 19th century, retain the archaic \"thou\" and \"thee\" and \"hast\" of traditional hymnody. The hymnal does not acknowledge or otherwise annotate edits to the original versions."

  "text" : "Voyage of Slaves is the third novel in Brian Jacques' Castaways of the Flying Dutchman series. It was released on September 13, 2006 in the UK and September 14, 2006 in the US. Ben is at first separated from Ned, previously known as Den, when their adrift boat is found by slave traders, who throw Ned overboard, because he is a black dog, which they think is a sign of the Devil. Ben is taken to Al Misurata, while Ned is found by a wandering troupe of entertainers that nurse him back to health. Among them is the beautiful African maiden, Serafina, who sings like an angel. Ben and Ned are reunited when Al Misurata has the troupe perform for him, and Ned has been incorporated into their act. Ben also falls in love with Serafina, who returns the affection. Ben and Ned find out while staying with Al Misurata that he plans to sell the troupe into slavery, under the guise of returning the troupe to Italy. While on his ship, the Sea Djinn, Ben and Ned jump overboard to escape, with the intention of rescuing their friends. As they reach land, they see a young boy named Joshua who is about to be attacked by sharks. They save him, and find out that the boy is the grandson of a Jewish sailor/warrior, who pledges to help the two in anything they might require aid with. They ask only to be taken to Italy. After saving his grandson, he quite willingly obliges. Once they reach Italy the boy and his faithful dog set sail once again for their destination with a friendly Greek sea captain. After another adventure, they finally rescue the troupe, and take shelter in a convent. Ben begins to tell Serafina the truth about his story, but is interuppted because, unfortunately, Al Misurata finds them, and in the struggle, Ben is stabbed in his shoulder. Al Misurata, his second-in-command Ghigno, and Serafina fall to their deaths over a cliff. Overwhelmed by sadness at the loss of his wonderful friends, but comforted by a heavenly vision that assures Ben that Serafina is in Heaven, the ancient boy and dog flee to the sea to get away from sorrows, and continue their eternal journey on the Blue Turtle."

  "text" : "Vatta's War is a science fiction series by Texan writer Elizabeth Moon, comprising five books: Trading in Danger (2003), Marque and Reprisal (2004) (Moving Target in UK and Australia), Engaging the Enemy (2006), Command Decision (2007), and Victory Conditions (2008). They have been characterized as military science fiction similar in style to the works of Lois McMaster Bujold (Vorkosigan Saga), David Weber and Walter Jon Williams (Dread Empire's Fall). The books follow the adventures of Kylara Vatta, a young member of the Vatta family, which runs the interstellar shipping corporation Vatta Enterprises. She had sought a life outside the family business by enrolling in the Slotter Key Spaceforce Academy, but she is forced to resign in her final year and assigned to captain an old trading ship for the corporation. Her military training is put to good use, however, during the crises she faces, first as a ship captain in dangerous situations, and later as the representative of a family under attack. The first book, Trading in Danger, is narrowly focused on Ky and the local crisis in which she becomes involved. The perspective expands in the later books as connections between piracy and ansible attacks on the one hand and Vatta Enterprises and InterStellar Communications Corporation (ISC) on the other are revealed."

  "text" : "Vertebrate Palaeontology is a basic textbook on vertebrate paleontology by Michael J. Benton, published by Blackwell's. It has so far appeared in four editions, published in 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2014. It is designed for paleontology graduate courses in biology and geology as well as for the interested layman. The book is widely used, and has received excellent reviews: \n* \"This book is a ′must′ for a biology or geology student and researcher concerned by palaeontology. It perfectly succeeds in showing how palaeobiological information is obtained\". Review of 3rd edition, Zentrallblatt fur Geologie und Palaontologie, 2007. \n* \"One anticipates that Benton's Vertebrate Palaeontology will become the 'industry standard', and as such it should occupy space on the shelves of all involved in undergraduate teaching\". Ivan Sansom, School of Earth Sciences, University of Birmingham. Review of the 2nd edition for the Micropalaeontological Society. \n* \"... his expertise in a range of problems of vertebrate paleontology is amazing. As a result the contents of his book [are] very well balanced\". Jerzy Dzik, Instytut Palaeobiologii PAN, Warsaw. Review of the 3rd edition for the Journal of Sedimentary Research. The book gives an overall account of every major group of living and fossil vertebrate. At the rear of the book is a phylogenetic classification which combines both the Linnaean hierarchy and the cladistic arrangement, and has been used as a guideline for the Wikipedia pages on living and extinct vertebrate taxa. However, some of Benton's classification differs from that in the Tree of Life Web Project, especially as regards the relationship of early amphibian groups (Batrachomorpha and Reptiliomorpha)."

  "text" : "Voices From The Street is an early realist novel by science fiction author Philip K. Dick, written in the early 1950s. Unpublished at the time, it was released on January 23, 2007 by Tor Books for the first time. As with many of his early books which were considered unsuitable for publication when they were first submitted as manuscripts, this was not science fiction, but rather literary fiction. The original manuscript was 547 pages in length. There is some speculation that the unpleasant marriage in the manuscript may be an attempt by Dick to sort out his own faltering second marriage to Kleo Apostolides (1950–58), as noted in Lawrence Sutin and Emmanuel Carriere's biographies of the author."

A federal appeals court ruled that the Miami-Dade School Board did not violate the Constitution in 2006 when it removed a controversial children's book about Cuba from the public schools' library system. In a 2-1 decision, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta said the board did not breach the First Amendment, and ordered a Miami federal judge to lift a preliminary injunction that had allowed Vamos a Cuba to be checked out from school libraries. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the legal challenge, so the book removal stands."

Zen has earned a return to the fold of actual police work, but now Officials in a high government ministry are desperate to finger someone—anyone—for the murder of an eccentric billionaire, whose corrupt dealings have enriched some of the most exalted figures in Italian politics. However, Oscar Burolo's murder would seem to be not just unsolvable but impossible. The magnate was killed on a heavily fortified Sardinian estate, where every room was monitored by video cameras. Those cameras captured Burolo's grisly death, but not the face of his killer. Zen grapples, in his idiosyncratic fashion, with this apparent \"locked door\" mystery by launching an ill-advised solo undercover investigation, amongst the fallout from which he is confronted by an almost forgotten face from the past, who now stalks him with vengeful intent."

  "text" : "Valmouth is a 1919 novel by British author Ronald Firbank. Valmouth is an imaginary English spa resort that attracts centenarians owing to its famed pure air. The town's name evokes actual seaside towns in the southwest peninsula of Britain, such as Falmouth, Dartmouth, Teignmouth, Exmouth and Weymouth. The novel's plot concerns, among other things, the effects of a black woman and her niece moving into a spa resort inhabited by wealthy centenarians. The ironic novel is about eroticism and exoticism in the milieu of quaint but lewd old British ladies at the fictional spa. The novel is noted for its florid and baroque style and parody-like humor, and its sexual innuendos both heterosexual and homosexual. There is also a fanciful brand of Catholicism, a blend of mortification of the flesh, high-flown mysticism, and proselytism. In 1958, a musical adaptation was made by Sandy Wilson."

The photographs were taken between 1966 and 1971, some originally shot in 35mm colour slide format and converted to black and white. These gritty, sometimes shocking pictures were described by the New York Times as \"The closest we are ever going to come to a definitive photo-journalistic essay on the war.\" The original hardback book has become a collector's item. Vietnam Inc. was republished in 2001 by Phaidon with a foreword by Noam Chomsky."

  "text" : "Venetia is a minor novel by Benjamin Disraeli, published in 1837, the year he was first elected to the House of Commons. The novel is a lightweight romantic fantasy. A contemporary reviewer, writing in an 1854 issue of the New Monthly Review, declared that he “liked it least of all Disraeli’s works.” Lord Byron and Shelley figure in its pages, under different names and different worldly circumstances from those in which they actually lived. We do not consider either portrait well drawn, and that of Shelley especially defective; but still Venetia, like all that Disraeli has written, contains much that is vivid and beautiful, and will be read with interest and delight by every man of taste. Michael Flavin’s Benjamin Disraeli: The Novel as a Political Discourse suggests that Venetia was largely a commercial endeavour for Disraeli, who was deep in debt at the time that he wrote it. In Byron and the Victorians, Andrew Elfenbein discusses Venetia in terms of Disraeli's presenting himself as \"the moral, political and literary successor to Byron, by manipulating the representation of Byron's sexuality\", making him straight instead of bisexual and portraying him as having steady but distant male friendships. He says the novel can best be described as \"kooky\" because of its confused and confusing portrayals of both Byron andShelley, giving each traits and life circumstances actually possessed by the other."

It was originally published by France's Éditions Milan in 1991, and in the United States by Gareth Stevens a year later. The book was awarded the Soleils d'Or at 1991's BD Festival. In the book, Violette Bellflower and her brother Periwinkle leave their Beechwood Grove home and decide to play at a faraway pond, although their family thinks it is too dangerous. There, they meet a boy in strange clothes who plays an enticing harmonica tune, and tricks them into being invited for cookies. Periwinkle jigs into joy after hearing this, but Violette informs him that the boy, Jimmy Renard, is actually a fox. She tells him that they should escape into the Big Passage, a secret complex tunnel that Beechwood's residents use for emergencies. But several of Renard's henchmen stop the bunnies' plan, and catch Periwinkle for their own dinner. Hearing this, Violette feels that her cleverness has failed, and at the foxes' burrow, she rescues her brother in an instant and heads into the Passage. The enemies go after the rabbits, only to be stopped by the collapse of stones Violette and Periwinkle shower on top of them. Both bunnies reach home safely, and tell Papa Bramble what happened. He feels angry, yet sees how brave they have been. Eventually, the two siblings snooze off at the dinner table, and soon have nightmares about their adventure. After Bramble reminds them what they went through, he goes off to sleep, saying: \"It seems the children haven't told me the entire story.\""

Despite the very labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of his specialty, Finlay created more than 2600 works of graphic art in his 35-year career. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Finlay in 2012."

Farmer describes a fictional-author story as \"a tale supposedly written by an author who is a character in fiction.\" Carey, who had access to Farmer's correspondence while editing the book, reveals in his introduction that in the early to mid-1970s Farmer planned to edit an anthology of fictional-author stories by other writers. Farmer solicited fictional-author stories from authors such as Arthur Jean Cox, Philip K. Dick, Leslie Fiedler, Ron Goulart, Howard Waldrop, and Gene Wolfe, urging them to submit their stories to venues such as The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Only Cox, Waldrop, and Wolfe completed their stories and had them published, although Philip K. Dick's never realized fictional-author story \"A Man for No Countries\" as by Hawthorne Abendsen is said to have led Dick to write his posthumous novel Radio Free Albemuth. In the end, Farmer's fictional-author anthology never materialized."

  "text" : "Vitamin C and the Common Cold is a popular book by Linus Pauling, first published in 1970, on vitamin C, its interactions with common cold and the role of vitamin C megadosage in human health. The book promoted the idea that taking large amounts of vitamin C could reduce the duration and severity of the common cold. A Nobel Prize-winning chemist and activist, Pauling promoted a view of vitamin C that is strongly at odds with most of the scientific community, which found little evidence for the alleged health benefits of greatly increased vitamin C intake. The book went through multiple editions, and a revised version that discussed the flu and other diseases, retitled Vitamin C, the Common Cold & the Flu, came out in 1976. The book characterizes the inability of humans and some other animals to produce vitamin C in terms of evolution and Pauling's concept of \"molecular disease\" (first articulated in his 1949 study, \"Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease\"). Pauling argues that the loss of vitamin C synthesis first arose as a molecular disease, because of a genetic mutation that resulted in the loss of the biochemical capacity to make the vitamin, but because diets of the primate ancestors of humans consisted of high levels of vitamin C from plant sources, the loss of that biochemical mechanism was not harmful and may have even been beneficial. He argues, however, that the subsequent shift to a high-meat, lower-plant diet resulted in widespread vitamin C deficiency."

  "text" : "Alexandre Havard’s Virtuous Leadership sets forth a leadership model to help professional people grow in virtue and lead effectively. Virtuous Leadership has been translated into 15 languages including Russian and Chinese. As such, some commentators have called it the first systematic and holistic attempt to relate the classical virtues to professional leadership in modern times. Havard’s leadership model is rooted in aretology—the science of virtue. Derived from the Greek word for virtue—arête—this branch of science stems from the work of the classical Greek philosophers—above all, Aristotle—and was developed further by such Christian philosophers and theologians as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas. A 10-point summary of Mr. Havard’s model: 1.  \n*  Authentic leadership must be based on authentic anthropology, which is to say, an authentic study of man. Such an anthropology must comprise aretology—the science of virtue—or it cannot be truly authentic. Virtue is a sound habit of the mind, the will and the heart that helps us achieve personal excellence and professional effectiveness. Leadership is all about virtue. Why? 1) Because virtue instills trust, the sine qua non of leadership. 2) Because virtue is a dynamic force, which enhances our capacity to act (the word \"virtue\" stems from the Latin word virtus, signifying \"strength\" or \"power\"). 2.  \n*  Magnanimity and humility, which are virtues principally of the heart, are the essence of leadership. Magnanimity is the habit of striving towards great things. Leaders are magnanimous in their dreams, visions, and sense of mission; and also in their capacity to challenge themselves and those around them. Humility is the habit of service. Humility means that leaders pull rather than push, teach rather than command, inspire rather than berate. Thus, leadership is less about displays of power than the empowerment of others. Magnanimity and humility are two virtues that cannot be separated. Together they constitute a unique ideal: the ideal of the dignity and greatness of man. Magnanimity makes us conscience of our personal dignity and greatness; humility makes us conscience of the dignity and greatness of others. Magnanimity and humility are the fruits of a proper appreciation of the value of man; pusillanimity, which prevents man from understanding himself, and pride, which prevents him from understanding others, are the derive from a false appreciation of the value of man. Leadership is a life ideal that recognizes, assimilates and promotes the truth about man. 3.  \n*  The virtues of prudence (practical wisdom), courage, self-control and justice, which are virtues principally of the mind and the will, are leadership’s bedrock virtues. Prudence enhances our ability to make right decisions; courage to stay the course and resist pressures of all kinds; self-control to subordinate passions to the spirit and direct them towards the fulfillment of the mission at hand, and justice to give every individual his due. 4.  \n*  Leaders are not born, but trained. Why? Because virtue is a habit acquired through practice. Leadership is a question of character (virtue, freedom, self-improvement), not temperament (biology and genetics). Temperament may aid the development of some virtues and hinder others, but when virtues grow, they stamp character on our temperament so that temperament ceases to dominate us. Temperament is not an obstacle to leadership. The real obstacle is lack of character, which quickly leaves us drained of moral energy and quite incapable of leading. 5.  \n*  Leaders do not lead by exercising the potestas, or power, inherent in their office. Instead, they lead through the auctoritas, the authority that stems from character. Those who lack genuine authority and succumb to the temptation to exercise unalloyed power are leaders in name only. In fact, they are non-leaders. This is a vicious circle: low authority leads to abuse of power, which leads to further erosion of authority, and the path to authentic leadership is blocked. 6.  \n*  In order to grow in virtue one must a) contemplate virtue so as to perceive its intrinsic beauty and desire it strongly (a matter of the heart); b) act virtuously habitually (a matter of the will) and c) practice all the virtues simultaneously with special attention to prudence (a matter of reason.) 7.  \n*  Through the practice of virtues, leaders achieve maturity in all its aspects—judgmental, emotional, and behavioral. The unmistakable signs of maturity are self-confidence and consistency, psychological stability, joy and optimism, naturalness, a sense of freedom and responsibility, and interior peace. Leaders are neither skeptical nor cynical, but realistic. Realism is the ability to maintain the noblest aspirations of the soul even as one remains beset by this or that personal weakness. This is not giving in to weakness, but transcending it through the practice of virtues. 8.  \n*  Leaders reject a utilitarian approach to virtue. The leader's motive in striving for virtue is not simply to become good at what he does. Rather, it is to realize himself fully as a human being in doing what he does well. Effectiveness is not the aim of self-improvement; it is merely one of its manifold (happy) results. Excellence comes first, effectiveness second. 9.  \n*  True leaders live by virtue ethics, rather than by rules-based ethics. Virtue ethics does not deny the validity of laws and rules, but it does insist that rules cannot be the ultimate foundation of ethics. Laws and rules must be at the service of virtue. Virtue ethics redound to original and creative leadership.  10.  \n*  Christian life has a formidable impact on leadership, because the supernatural virtues of faith, hope and charity (which are the heart of Christian life) elevate, strengthen, and transfigure the natural virtues, which are the foundation of leadership. No study of the impact of virtue on leadership is complete without taking into consideration the supernatural virtues."

  "text" : "Voluntary Socialism is a work of nonfiction by the American mutualist Francis Dashwood Tandy (1867–1913). First published in 1896, it has been favorably cited by many individualist anarchists, including Clarence Lee Swartz, minarchist Robert Nozick and left-libertarian Roderick T. Long, who has noted that \"many of the standard moves in market anarchist theory today are already in evidence in Tandy\". Tandy was a member of the \"Denver Circle\", a group of men who associated with Benjamin Tucker and contributed to the periodical Liberty. In the preface to Voluntary Socialism, he declares his intent to \"give a complete outline of [Voluntaryism] in its most important bearings\". To that end, chapters one through four outline the foundation for Tandy's anarchism, drawing heavily from Max Stirner and Herbert Spencer. Chapters five through fourteen cover specific areas of interest, including private defense agencies, the labor theory of value, mutual banking, transportation, and political strategy. The book is dedicated to Benjamin Tucker, \"whose lucid writings and scathing criticisms have done so much to dispel the clouds of economic superstition\"."

  "text" : "Ved Vejen (meaning By the Wayside or At the Roadside) is a short novel written by the Danish author Herman Bang in 1886. It was originally published in Copenhagen by Det Schubotheske Forlag as part of a collection of four stories entitled Stille Eksistenser (Quiet Existences), centering on women who are subdued or living in isolation. It was first published independently in 1898. An impressionist novel, it relates the story of Katinka, a sensitive but ambitious young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. At the time of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily newspapers were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen. It is now considered an important contribution to Danish literature, listed in the Danish Culture Canon. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow."

  "text" : "Van Morrison (Sir George Ivan Morrison, OBE, born 31 August 1945) is a Northern Irish singer and songwriter with a reputation for being at once stubborn, idiosyncratic, and sublime. His studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance, and the live album It's Too Late to Stop Now, are acclaimed as among the greatest recorded. In 2016 he was knighted for his musical achievements and his services to tourism and charitable causes in Northern Ireland. Known as \"Van the Man\", Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands covering the popular hits of the day. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967. After Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks (1968). Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially a poor seller; Moondance (1970), however, established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and the Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968. Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", \"Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually-inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as the album Astral Weeks and lesser-known ones such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic soul\". He has received six Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Victory for us is to see you suffer is a 2007 book on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict written by Philip C. Winslow. In the book, Winslow, a former U.N. relief worker and journalist, reports on his experiences in the West Bank during the Second Intifada. Winslow explains the unusual title of the book in this passage, as follows: Ami Ayalon, a peace campaigner and member of the Knesset, was asked if he stood by his oft-quoted remark that the Palestinians and the Israelis hate each other. \"I cannot say that I hate Palestinians, but I think, as a nation, as a society, yes, most Israelis hate Palestinians and most Palestinians hate Israelis... I had a very interesting meeting in London during the intifada. A Palestinian friend approached me [and said]: 'Ami, we won. We Palestinians won.'... I asked him, 'Are you crazy? What do you mean \"We won\"? You are losing so many people... and we are losing so many people. What is the whole essence of victory?' He said, 'Ami you don't understand us. Victory for us is to see you suffer. This is all we want. Finally, after so many years, we are not the only ones to suffer in the Middle East.'\" ...It was a double-edged sword. Aylon added, \"In a way it is the same for us. We suffer, we lost many people, and [at] a certain point we were looking for revenge.\""

  "text" : "Vision In White is the first book of the Bride Quartet series of romance novels, written by Nora Roberts. It spent two weeks atop the New York Times Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the USA Today bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in trade paperback format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by I-Play in 2010. In her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. Vision in White was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works. The novel marked Roberts' return to contemporary romance. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, Vision In White explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love."

  "text" : "Veṇvāroha is a work in Sanskrit composed by Mādhava (c.1350 – c.1425) of Sangamagrāma the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. It is a work in 74 verses describing methods for the computation of the true positions of the Moon at intervals of about half an hour for various days in an anomalistic cycle. This work is an elaboration of an earlier and shorter work of Mādhava himself titled Sphutacandrāpti. Veṇvāroha is the most popular astronomical work of Mādhava. It is dated 1403 CE. Acyuta Piṣārati (1550–1621), another prominent mathematician/astronomer of the Kerala school, has composed a Malayalam commentary on Veṇvāroha. This astronomical treatise is of a type generally described as Karaṇa texts in India. Such works are characterized by the fact that they are compilations of computational methods of practical astronomy. The title Veṇvāroha literally means Bamboo Climbing and it is indicative of the computational procedure expounded in the text. The computational scheme is like climbing a bamboo tree, going up and up step by step at measured equal heights. The novelty and ingenuity of the method attracted the attention of several of the followers of Mādhava and they composed similar texts thereby creating a genre of works in Indian mathematical tradition collectively referred to as ‘veṇvāroha texts’. These include Drik-veṇvārohakriya of unknown authorship of epoch 1695 and Veṇvārohastaka of Putuman Somāyaji. In the technical terminology of astronomy, the ingenuity introduced by Mādhava in Veṇvāroha can be explained thus: Mādhava has endeavored to compute the true longitude of the Moon by making use of the true motions rather than the epicyclic astronomy of the Aryabhata tradition. He made use of the anomalistic revolutions for computing the true positions of the Moon using the successive true daily velocity specified in Candravākyas for easy memorization and use. Veṇvāroha has been studied from a modern perspective and the process is explained using the properties of periodic functions."

Prateek, in this book, talks about the various kinds of pressure an Indian student has to go through- parental pressure, peer pressure and gender-biases. The book narrates how these 4 failures in the city land in a village which is not even significant enough to get a name in the directory of the Indian Government. Prateek shows how these four failures combine to make a success for the village, which, at the end is known all over the country for the drastic change it goes through because of the four children that visited it."

  "text" : "Venezuela Heroica: Cuadros históricos is a Venezuelan novel. It was written by Eduardo Blanco and published in 1881, with an expanded second edition in 1883. It is Blanco's main work, and presents a classic romantic view of history as an epic. Venezuela heroica is structured in five vignettes that depict the main battles and heroes of the Venezuelan War of Independence. It was from General José Antonio Páez himself that Blanco heard the stories of the Battle of Carabobo, during an encounter with Marshal Juan Crisóstomo Falcón to end the Federal War (1859–1863) near the site of the battle. Páez was so moved from his memories of youth, the anecdote goes, that he could not stop telling his aide (Blanco) the details of the battle. It was Falcón who then told Blanco \"you are listening to the Iliad from the very lips of Achilles\"."

  "text" : "Vendetta is a Star Trek: The Next Generation tie-in novel written by Peter David and published by Pocket Books in 1991. The book was a New York Times best-seller, peaking at #4 on the Paperback Best Sellers list in late April 1991. The novel was subject to a dispute between Peter David and Richard Arnold, who wished the Borg character Reannon to be removed, with the logic that Borg could not be female. This was prior to a regular female Borg character, Seven of Nine, appearing in Star Trek: Voyager. Because of this, the novel was printed with a disclaimer making it explicitly apocryphal. The plot centers around the actions of a woman named Delcara from a race which has been assimilated by the Borg, who has gone to extreme lengths to exact her revenge upon them. Delcara controls a Planet Killer, later revealed to be the finished version of the one fought by the USS Enterprise during the events of \"The Doomsday Machine\" episode of the original Star Trek. This Planet Killer is also 'inhabited' by the psychic impressions of its creators which exist as part of the Planet Killer's control system. Both Delcara and the 'ghosts' within the Planet Killer share a hatred of the Borg, and both Planet Killers are claimed to have come from just outside the galactic barrier surrounding our own galaxy. The Borg, having assimilated a Ferengi ship along the way, invade the Planet Killer, and force Delcara to attempt to reach Warp 10, then assumed unbreakable in Star Trek canon (later disproven in Voyager, though with grave consequences if the proper protection isn't in place), in order to reach the heart of Borg space to exact her revenge before she dies from severe phaser wounds."

  "text" : "Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage is a book edited by political economists Peter A. Hall and David Soskice. In their sizable introductory chapter Hall and Soskice set out two distinct types of capitalist economies: liberal market economies (LME) (e.g., U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland) and coordinated market economies (CME) (e.g. Germany, Japan, Sweden, Austria). Those two types can be distinguished by the primary way in which firms coordinate with each other and other actors, such as trade unions. In LMEs firms primarily coordinate their endeavours by way of hierarchies and market mechanisms. Coordinated market economies rely more heavily on non-market forms of interaction in the coordination of their relationships with other actors. They considered 5 spheres in which firms must develop relationships with others: 1. Industrial relations - Companies have to coordinate with their workers, trade unions and other employers over wage and productivity. CMEs generally have a higher level of membership in trade unions and employers organizations and bargaining over wages tends to happen at the industry, sectoral or national level. Conversely in LMEs workers and employers are often less organized and wage negotiations take place at the company level.2. vocational training and education - In CMEs workers tend to have specific skills that are tied to the firm or the industry their working in. In LMEs workers have more general skills that easily can be used to work at other companies.3. corporate governance - Firms in CMEs rely more on patient capital, i.e. capital that doesn't totally depend on financial openness and short term return on investment. LMEs tend to rely more heavily on public information about finances and short-term capital, such as stockmarkets.4. Inter-firm relations - Inter-firm relations in CMEs tend to be more collaborative, while inter-firm relations in LMEs are more competitive and arms-length. 5. Relations with employees - In CMEs managers often have to cooperate with employees to reach major decisions, while in LMEs there is often a more adverserial relation between management and employee in which managers are the prime decision-makers. They categorized capitalism of different countries into the two types (LME and CME, however there is a third type which is \"Hybrid\" which consists of countries in the mediterranean ring, but Hall and Soskice only used LMEs and CMEs in their analysis). Varieties of capitalism is a new framework for understanding the institutional similarities and differences among the developed economies since national political economies can be compared by reference to the way in which firms resolve the coordination problems they face in these five spheres. These two models are at the poles of a spectrum along which many nations can be arrayed. i.e.) even within these two types, there are significant variations. Extending the scope of Hall and Soskice's framework to countries outside Western Europe and the US, other authors have developed different varieties of capitalism, such as dependent market economies and hierarchical market economies. According to the book, institutions are shaped not only by legal system but by informal rules or common knowledge acquired by actors through history and culture of one nation. Institutional complementarities suggest that nations with a particular type of institution then develop complementary institution in other spheres. (for example: countries with stock market liberalization has less labor protection and vice versa). Firms of LME and CME respond very differently to a similar shock and institutions are socializing agencies and go through a continuous processes of adaptation. Institutional arrangements of a nation’s political economy tend to push its firms toward particular kinds of corporate strategies. Thus, two types of economies have different capacities for innovation and tend to distribute income and employment differently. Examples of LMEs are the U.S. and the U.K economies while most of Scandinavian countries and Germany are CMEs."

  "text" : "Vertical is a 2010 novel by Rex Pickett and the second novel in the Sideways Trilogy. It is a sequel to the novel Sideways, which was made into a successful 2004 film of the same name. The novel takes place seven years after the events depicted in Sideways. It contains the same characters as in the earlier novel: Miles, a writer, his friend Jack, a sometime actor, and Miles' mother Phyllis, all wine lovers. Miles is now a successful author, having written a novel called \"Shameless\" with much the same situations as the real-life Sideways. Like Sideways, \"Shameless\" has been adapted as a successful movie. Jack, who had been prosperous in Sideways, is now divorced and short of cash. Pickett says that the character Jack is based on his friend Roy Gittens, a film electrician. The novel recounts a road trip involving the three and a Filipina caretaker, Joy, as they head first to Oregon's Willamette Valley for the International Pinot Noir Celebration, and then to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where Phyllis is to live with her sister, Alice. The book was self-published by Pickett. He has said that the book is autobiographical, saying: \"The trip didn’t happen with Jack, but everything with my mother was real. I lived that, and Jack is that character now, he’s a guy who’s gone to seed. And I am a guy who’s had success and overimbibed and did some things that I don’t do anymore.\""

  "text" : "Victory Point: Operations Red Wings and Whalers - The Marine Corps' Battle for Freedom in Afghanistan is a nonfiction book by author Ed Darack published in hardcover in 2009 and in paperback in 2010 by The Berkley Publishing Group, an imprint of The Penguin Publishing Group. Victory Point comprehensively documents Operation Red Wings and Operation Whalers, two historically significant military operations that took place in the summer of 2005 in the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan's eastern Kunar Province. Victory Point tells the comprehensive story of Operation Red Wings including regional history of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, specifically, the Korangal Valley and other areas of and around the Pech District of this eastern Afghanistan province. The book further provides background information about how Operation Red Wings evolved, including its purpose, and gives information on the leader of the target cell of the operation, Ahmad Shah, and how this information was uncovered. The book provides background on the command relationships among the various military entities involved in the operation, and discusses the ambush of the four Navy SEALs tasked as a reconnaissance and surveillance team for the opening of the operation. Victory Point further provides information on the shootdown of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command's 160th Special Operation's Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR(A)) MH-47 Special Operations Helicopter, which resulted in the deaths of 8 Navy SEALs and 8 Army Special Operations aviators,and the search for and recovery of Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of the four-man Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team. Victory Point narrates the development and execution of the sequel to Operation Red Wings, Operation Whalers. Operation Whalers resulted in the serious injury of Ahmad Shah and forced Shah and his men into Pakistan after a series of intense firefights in a high, steep, and treacherous valley. Victory Point illustrates the complexities and difficulties of this successful operation, one that relied not only on traditional Marine Corps infantry tactics, but modern combined arms coordination, with assets including Army Air Ambulance, U.S. Air Force attack aircraft, U.S. Army intelligence, U.S. Army artillery, and U.S. Air Force logistical support. Author Ed Darack spent two months on the ground in Afghanistan with Marines in the region where Operation Red Wings and Operation Whalers took place for research for writing Victory Point. Victory Point has been noted for its detail and comprehensiveness with regard to both Operation Red Wings as well as Operation Whalers. Victory Point has also been noted for its comprehensive overview of the region in which these operations took place. Victory Point has been cited in a number of books about the Afghan war. Victory Point was chosen as one of the best books of 2009 by the United States Naval Institute."

The authors of the book explore \"anomalous experiences\" defined as unusual but not necessarily psychopathological phenomena that may hold great significance for those who have them. The book focuses on psychological and neuroscientific research on the experiences, rather than on their ontological nature, and includes near-death experiences, out-of-body experiences, hallucinations, lucid dreams, mysticism, psi-events, and reincarnation. The second edition has 14 chapters written by twenty-two contributors. It has a clear and readable style which makes it suitable for a general audience."

  "text" : "Vertigo is a wordless novel by American artist Lynd Ward (1905–1985), published in 1937. In three intertwining parts, the story tells of the effects the Great Depression has on the lives of an elderly industrialist and a young man and woman. Considered his masterpiece, Ward uses the work to express the socialist sympathies of his upbringing; he aimed to present what he called \"impersonal social forces\" by depicting the individuals whose actions are responsible for those forces. The work is filled with symbolic motifs, and is in a more detailed and realistic style than Ward's Expressionistic earlier works. The images—one to a page—are borderless and of varied dimensions. At 230 wood engravings Vertigo was Ward's longest and most complex wordless novel, and proved to be the last he finished—in 1940 he abandoned one he was working on, and in the last years of his life began another that he never finished. For the remainder of his career Ward turned to book illustration, especially children's books, some of which he or his wife May McNeer authored."

  "text" : "A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing micro-organism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these micro-organisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are also being investigated). The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five infections. The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the...Variolae vaccinae...known...[as]...the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox. In 1881, to honour Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed."

Venmurasu is being written as a series of books, each one composed in a different style and genre. As of May 2016, nine books have been published online; the tenth one is being serialized.
