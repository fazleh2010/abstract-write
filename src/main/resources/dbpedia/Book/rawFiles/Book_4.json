It also details the start of his journalistic career and explains how he dealt with the joys and tragic events that accompanied being a Liverpool fan in the 80s. In brief reviews, the Mirror called it a \"brilliantly incisive and profoundly entertaining analysis\" and Wales on Sunday praised its \"wonderful insight, written in a measured yet endearing way.\" The Liverpool Echo's Paddy Shennan described Reade as one of Britain's \"sharpest and funniest writers\" and praised Reade's treatment of the Hillsborough disaster."

  "text" : "419 is a novel by Canadian writer Will Ferguson. Published by Penguin Canada in 2012, the novel was the winner of the 2012 Scotiabank Giller Prize. Titled for the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code which deals with fraud, the events of the novel are set in motion by Henry Curtis, a retired school teacher in Calgary, Alberta who dies in a car accident after becoming embroiled in an advance-fee fraud scam which has left his family destitute. Following his death, his daughter Laura travels to Lagos, Nigeria in an attempt to track down and bring to justice the perpetrator of the scam. Prior to the novel's publication, Ferguson was known primarily as a writer of humor literature. At the Giller Prize gala, he told the media that the novel \"began with the thought that maybe there really is a Nigerian prince somewhere who canâ€™t gain his freedom for lack of funds...but when I started writing it, the story began to turn dark, all by itself.\""
