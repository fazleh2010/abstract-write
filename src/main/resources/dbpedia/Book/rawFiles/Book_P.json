  "text" : "Philosophical Investigations (German: Philosophische Untersuchungen) is a work by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, first published, posthumously, in 1953, in which Wittgenstein discusses numerous problems and puzzles in the fields of semantics, logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind. He puts forth the view that conceptual confusions surrounding language use are at the root of most philosophical problems, contradicting or discarding much of what he argued in his earlier work, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. He alleges that the problems are traceable to a set of related assumptions about the nature of language, which themselves presuppose a particular conception of the essence of language. This conception is considered and ultimately rejected for being too general; that is, as an essentialist account of the nature of language it is simply too narrow to be able to account for the variety of things we do with language. Wittgenstein begins the book with a quotation from St. Augustine, whom he cites as a proponent of the generalized and limited conception that he then summarizes: The individual words in language name objects—sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands. He then sets out throughout the rest of the book to demonstrate the limitations of this conception, including, he argues, with many traditional philosophical puzzles and confusions that arise as a result of this limited picture. Philosophical Investigations is highly influential. Within the analytic tradition, the book is considered by many as being one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century, and it continues to influence contemporary philosophers, especially those studying mind and language."

  "text" : "Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman, Mr Bennet, living in Longbourn. Set in England in the late 18th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after two gentlemen have moved into their neighbourhood: the rich and eligible Mr Bingley, and his status-conscious friend, the even richer and more eligible Mr Darcy. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy is disdainful of local society and repeatedly clashes with the Bennets' lively second daughter, Elizabeth. Pride and Prejudice retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of \"most loved books\". It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Likewise, it has paved the way for archetypes that abound in many contemporary literature of our time. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes."

  "text" : "Pale Fire is a 1962 novel by Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is presented as a 999-line poem titled \"Pale Fire\", written by the fictional poet John Shade, with a foreword and lengthy commentary written by Shade's neighbor and academic colleague, Charles Kinbote. Together these elements form a narrative in which both fictional authors are central characters. Pale Fire has spawned a wide variety of interpretations and a large body of written criticism, which Finnish literary scholar Pekka Tammi estimated in 1995 as more than 80 studies. The Nabokov authority Brian Boyd has called it \"Nabokov's most perfect novel\", and the critic Harold Bloom called it \"the surest demonstration of his own genius ... that remarkable tour de force\". It was ranked 53rd on the list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels and 1st on the American literary critic  Larry McCaffery's 20th Century’s Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction."

  "text" : "Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608–1674). The first version, published in 1667, consisted of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in the manner of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout and a note on the versification. It is considered by critics to be Milton's major work, and it helped solidify his reputation as one of the greatest English poets of his time. The poem concerns the Biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Milton's purpose, stated in Book I, is to \"justify the ways of God to men\"."

Some passages in the novel have the characters speaking in the Gullah language. The novel was adapted for a 1927 play by Heyward and his wife, playwright Dorothy Heyward. Even before the play had been fully written, Heyward was in discussions with George Gershwin for an operatic version of his novel, which appeared in 1935 as Porgy and Bess (renamed to distinguish it from the play)."

The plot focuses on a group of female students at an Australian women's college in 1900 who inexplicably vanish at the site of an enormous rock formation while on a Valentine's Day picnic, and also explores the outlying effects the girls' disappearance has on the community. The novel has been often discussed and debated due to its inexorably ambiguous ending. Lindsay wrote the novel over a four-week period at her home Mulberry Hill in Baxter, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. It was first published in 1967 in Australia by Cheshire Publishing and was released in paperback by Penguin in 1970. The rock formation featured in the story, Hanging Rock, is an actual geological formation located in Victoria, Australia. The novel was adapted into a critically acclaimed film of the same name in 1975 by director Peter Weir."

  "text" : "Portnoy's Complaint (1969) is the American novel that turned its author Philip Roth into a major celebrity, sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver. The novel tells the humorous monologue of \"a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor,\" who confesses to his psychoanalyst in \"intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language.\" Many of its characteristics (comedic prose; themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration; a self-conscious literariness) went on to become Roth trademarks. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Portnoy's Complaint 52nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time included this novel in its \"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.\""

  "text" : "Prozac Nation is an autobiography by Elizabeth Wurtzel published in 1994. The book describes the author's experiences with major depression, her own character failings and how she managed to live through particularly difficult periods while completing college and working as a writer. Prozac is a trade name for the antidepressant fluoxetine. Wurtzel originally titled the book I Hate Myself and I Want To Die but her editor convinced her otherwise. It ultimately carried the subtitle Young and Depressed in America: A Memoir. Reviews were mixed. In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani characterized Prozac Nation as \"by turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware,\" comparing it with the \"raw candor of Joan Didion's essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song.\" While praising Wurtzel's prose style as \"sparkling\" and \"luminescent,\" Kakutani thought the memoir \"would have benefited enormously from some strict editing\" and said that its \"self-pitying passages make the reader want to shake the author, and remind her that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard.\"  Publishers Weekly was similarly ambivalent: \"By turns emotionally powerful and tiresomely solipsistic, [Wurtzel's] book straddles the line between an absorbing self-portrait and a coy bid for public attention.\" Writing in New York Magazine, Walter Kirn found that although Prozac Nation had \"moments of shapely truth-telling,\" altogether it was \"almost unbearable\" and \"a work of singular self-absorption.\" Calling the book a \"tedious and poorly written story of Wurtzel's melodramatic life, warts and all (actually all warts),\" Erica L. Werner asked in the The Harvard Crimson, \"How did this chick get a book contract in the first place? Why was she allowed to write such crap?\" Werner also described Prozac Nation as \"obscenely exhibitionistic,\" with \"no purpose other than alternately to bore us and make us squirm.\" She said that the author \"comes off as an irritating, solipsistic brat.\" \"It would be possible to have more sympathy for Ms. Wurtzel if she weren't so exasperatingly sympathetic to herself,\" wrote Ken Tucker in the New York Times Book Review. He observed, \"The reader may well begin riffling the pages of the book in the vain hope that there will be a few complimentary Prozac capsules tucked inside for one's own relief.\"  Kirkus Reviews thought the book to be filled with \"narcissistic pride\" and concluded, \"By alternately belittling and belaboring her depression, Wurtzel loses her credibility: Either she's a brat who won't shape up or she needs the drugs. Ultimately, you don't care which.\" The book was adapted into a feature film, Prozac Nation (2001), starring Christina Ricci."

It was the second published of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia (1950–1956) and Lewis had finished writing it in 1949, before the first book was out. It is volume four in recent editions of the series, which are sequenced according to Narnia history. Like the others it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions. Prince Caspian features \"return to Narnia\" by the four Pevensie children of the first novel, about one year later in England but 1300 years later in Narnia. It is the only one of The Chronicles where men dominate Narnia; the talking animals and mythical beings are oppressed and some may be endangered. The English siblings are legendary Kings and Queens of Narnia whom the refugee Prince Caspian magically recalls for assistance, as children once again. Macmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year. Prince Caspian has been adapted and filmed as two episodes of BBC television series in 1989 and as a feature film in 2008."

  "text" : "Pattern Recognition is a novel by science fiction writer William Gibson published in 2003. Set in August and September 2002, the story follows Cayce Pollard, a 32-year-old marketing consultant who has a psychological sensitivity to corporate symbols. The action takes place in London, Tokyo, and Moscow as Cayce judges the effectiveness of a proposed corporate symbol and is hired to seek the creators of film clips anonymously posted to the internet. The novel's central theme involves the examination of the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49. Pattern Recognition is Gibson's eighth novel and his first one to be set in the contemporary world. Like his previous work, it has been classified as a science fiction and postmodern novel, with the action unfolding along a thriller plot line. Critics approved of the writing but found the plot unoriginal and some of the language distracting. The book peaked at number four on the New York Times Best Seller list, was nominated for the 2003 British Science Fiction Association Award, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and Locus Awards."

A number of characters from Glue make an appearance as well. This sequel picks up ideas of the film adaptation of Trainspotting. One example is the fact that \"Spud\" has received his share of the drug money, which is shown in the film, but only alluded to in the book."

  "text" : "Principles of Compiler Design, by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman, is a classic textbook on compilers for computer programming languages. It is often called the \"dragon book\" and its cover depicts a knight and a dragon in battle; the dragon is green, and labelled \"Complexity of Compiler Construction\", while the knight wields a lance labeled \"LALR parser generator\". The book may be called the \"green dragon book\" to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi & Ullman's Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, which is the \"red dragon book\". The second edition of Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools added a fourth author, Monica S. Lam, and the dragon became purple; hence becoming the \"purple dragon book.\" The book also contains the entire code for making a compiler. The back cover offers the original inspiration of the cover design: The dragon is replaced by windmills, and the knight is Don Quixote. The book was published by Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-00022-9. The acknowledgments mention that the book was entirely typeset at Bell Labs using troff on the Unix operating system,of which at that time had been little seen outside the Laboratories."

The main title is an acronym that stands for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved\". The book is arranged into two parts, the first part being a fictionalized autobiography of the couple and the second part describing 179different psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself), including detailed synthesis instructions, bioassays, dosages, and other commentary. The second part was made freely available by Shulgin on Erowid while the first part is available only in the printed text. While the reactions described are beyond the ability of people with a basic chemistry education, some tend to emphasize techniques that do not require difficult to obtain chemicals. Notable among these are the use of mercury-aluminum amalgam (an unusual but easy to obtain reagent) as a reducing agent and detailed suggestions on legal plant sources of important drug precursors such as safrole."

  "text" : "Persuasion is the last novel fully completed by Jane Austen. It was published at the end of 1817, six months after her death. The story concerns Anne Elliot, a young Englishwoman of 27, whose family is moving to lower expenses and get out of debt, at the same time the wars come to an end, putting sailors on shore. They rent their home to an Admiral and his wife. The wife’s brother, Navy Captain Frederick Wentworth, was engaged to Anne in 1806, and now they meet again, both single and unattached, no contact in more than seven years. This sets the scene for many humorous encounters as well as a second, well-considered chance at love and marriage for Anne Elliot in her second \"bloom\". The novel was well-received by the small world who could afford books in the early 19th century. Greater fame came later in the century, continued in the 20th century, and through to the 21st century. Over that time, scholarly debate on this novel and all Austen's books proceeded apace, which debate continues as to the best aspects of this novel. One major point made by Virginia Woolf and picked up by Stuart Tave, echoing one of the good conversations in the novel, is that the most famous women characters in fiction were written by men, until Jane Austen came along. Anne Elliot is noteworthy among Jane Austen's heroines for being 27 years old, not 19 or 20 years old in that first bloom of youth, and having a second chance at a happy marriage. As Persuasion is Austen's last completed novel, it is accepted as her most maturely written novel showing a refinement of literary conception indicative of a woman approaching forty years of age. Unlike Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice, the novel Persuasion was not rewritten from earlier drafts of novels which Austen had originally started before 1800. Her literary technique of the use of free indirect discourse in narrative was by 1816 fully developed and in full evidence when this novel was written. The first edition of the novel was co-published with the previously unpublished novel written during her younger years in 1803 and titled Northanger Abbey; later editions of the two were published as separate novels. Popular acceptance of the novel was furthered, or reflected, by two notable made-for-television film versions released first in Britain: Amanda Root starring in the lead role in the 1995 version co-starring Ciarán Hinds, and followed by Sally Hawkins starring in the 2007 version for ITV1 co-starring Rupert Penry-Jones."

  "text" : "Player Piano, the first novel of Kurt Vonnegut, was published in 1952. It depicts a dystopia of automation, describing the deterioration it can cause to quality of life. The story takes place in a near-future society that is almost totally mechanized, eliminating the need for human laborers. This widespread mechanization creates conflict between the wealthy upper class—the engineers and managers who keep society running—and the lower class, whose skills and purpose in society have been replaced by machines. The book uses irony and sentimentality, which were to become hallmarks developed further in Vonnegut's later works."

  "text" : "Prey is a novel by Michael Crichton, first published in November 2002. An excerpt was published in the January–February 2003 issue of Seed. Like Jurassic Park, the novel serves as a cautionary tale about developments in science and technology; in this case, nanotechnology, genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. The book features relatively new advances in the computing/scientific community, such as artificial life, emergence (and by extension, complexity), genetic algorithms, and agent-based computing. Fields such as population dynamics and host-parasite coevolution are also at the heart of the novel. While the novel has yet to be adapted into a movie, film rights to the novel were purchased by 20th Century Fox."

  "text" : "Phase Space (subtitled Stories from the Manifold and Elsewhere) is a 2003 science fiction collection by British eriter Stephen Baxter, containing twenty-three thematically linked stories, in which the human relationship with the universe is explored: whether humanity is truly alone in the universe, if there are other intelligent species, if these have turned their backs on us, or if expansion itself is destined to fail. Written in the same style as most of Stephen Baxter's work, Phase Space is a collection of more or less scientifically based stories in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke. The stories are mostly set in the same Multiverse as the books in his Manifold series, with a few stories related to his separate NASA Trilogy. The book contains the following short stories: \n* Dreams (I) \n* \"Moon-Calf\" (1998) – A retired astronaut finds hints of an ancient space voyage while on holiday in England. \n* Earths \n* \"Open Loops\" (2000) – An astronaut explores, and later becomes a colonist on an asteroid, observing the expansion and evolution of humanity over the millennia. \n* \"Glass Earth, Inc.\" (1997) – A policeman must sort through the memories of a murder to find out who the killer is, and in the process, learns more about himself than he ever knew. \n* \"Poyekhali 3201\" (1997) – The experiences of a Russian cosmonaut are no more than the ultimate re-enactment. (An earlier version of this story appeared in Decalog 5: Wonders (1997).) \n* \"Dante Dreams\" (1998) – A police woman from San Francisco travels to the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a Jesuit priest and an illegally-created sentient hologram based on the late priest. \n* \"War Birds\" (1997) – When Apollo 11 explodes on the Moon, the US blames the Russians, then fast-tracks its Space Shuttle program for military applications. \n* Worlds \n* \"Sun-Drenched\" (1998) – When two Apollo astronauts are stranded on the Moon, they decide to expose themselves to the elements in the hope of colonising the Moon with bacteria and viruses from their own bodies. \n* \"Martian Autumn\" (2002) – Too much environmental stress and life on Earth might undergo an evolutionary \"reboot\", like what happened on Mars. \n* \"Sun God\" (1997) – A pendant to Titan, in which a Titanian beetle finds an abandoned Saturn rocket and studies the strange creatures (humans) who made it.  \n* \"Sun-Cloud\" (2001) – A sentient multi-corpuscular being travels to the distant future to fulfill her dying sister's dream: to witness the emergence of stars. \n* Manifold \n* \"Sheena 5\" – The sentient squid plotline of Manifold: Time as a separate short story, with a different ending. \n* \"The Fubar Suit\" (1997) – An astronaut is stranded in space wearing a suit guaranteed to re-create her when her corpse is discovered. Meanwhile, a microscopic world evolves inside the suit, threatening her existence. \n* \"Grey Earth\" (2001) – The end of Manifold: Origin from the viewpoint of Mary, the Neanderthal friend of Nemoto, set on the axis-tilted Earth of the Neanderthals. \n* \"Huddle\" (1999) – Madeleine Meacher from Manifold: Space returns to an Earth where the descendents of humans occupy the ecological niche of seals or penguins, a hundred thousand years after the events of the novel. \n* Paradox \n* \"Refugium\" (2002) – Two men, an enthusiast and a cynic, set out in an alien spacecraft to discover an answer to the Fermi paradox: where have all the extra-terrestrial civilisations gone? \n* \"Lost Continent\" (2001) – Two friends discuss the possibility that Atlantis may have been more than a myth, and may have been more recent than anyone ever dreamed. \n* \"Tracks\" (2001) – Two astronauts are on the Moon in 1973 collecting rock samples; things go wrong and the mission is aborted. But what the astronauts remember is much stranger than what the video tapes show. \n* \"Lines of Longitude\" (1997) – A physicist teaching a community college course must cope with reality when one of her students dies after having disappeared for several days. The aftermath of his death have graver consequences than she can imagine. \n* \"The Barrier\" (1998) – Two old men travel through space in a malfunctioning ship toward the edge of all; an exploration of the Zoo Hypothesis. \n* \"Marginalia\" (1999) – Baxter's novel Voyage as conspiracy theory- the idea that NASA really did go to Mars in the 1970s is explored. \n* \"The We Who Sing\" (2002) – Intelligence exists in a universe of shining gas clouds, before space became transparent. \n* \"The Gravity Mine\" (2000) – Posthuman beings in the deep future of Manifold: Time struggle in a dying universe. \n* \"Spindrift\" (1999) – Will human endeavours (e.g. colonisation of the Moon) have any ultimate consequence? Or will humanity arise then vanish unobserved, like spindrift? \n* \"Touching Centauri\" (2003) – Scientists attempting to use a laser to contact another world inadvertently cause the end of their universe, while everyone struggles with the ultimate nature of their existence. (While snippets of the story are touched upon between each previous story, the full explanation is given here.) \n* Dreams (II) \n* \"The Twelfth Album\" (1998) – Two friends mourning their departed shipmate find a strange Beatles record, leading them to believe that their friend's drunken ravings might have been true."

  "text" : "Peril at End House is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie first published in the US by the Dodd, Mead and Company in February 1932 and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in March of the same year. The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6). The book features Christie's famous character Hercule Poirot, as well as Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp, and is the sixth novel featuring Poirot. Poirot and Hastings vacation in Cornwall, meeting young Magdala \"Nick\" Buckley and her friends. He is persuaded that someone is out to kill her. They meet all of her friends at her home called End House. Though he aims to protect Nick, a murder happens provoking Poirot to mount a serious investigation. The novel was well received when first published, with the plot remarked as unusually ingenious and diabolically clever by reviewers. Writing in 1990, Robert Barnard found it cunning, but not one of Christie's very best. It has been adapted to stage, radio, film, television, graphic novel, and a computer game, and translated to many other languages as a book."

  "text" : "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a 1985 literary historical cross-genre novel (originally published in German as Das Parfum) by German writer Patrick Süskind. The novel explores the sense of smell and its relationship with the emotional meaning that scents may carry. It is a story of identity, communication and the morality of the human spirit. The story centers on Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an unloved 18th-century French orphan who is born with an exceptional sense of smell, being able to distinguish a vast range of scents in the world around him. Grenouille becomes a perfumer but is drawn to murder when he encounters a young girl with an unsurpassed wondrous scent. Later, living in isolation in a mountain cave, he is shaken after some years to discover his own complete lack of scent; the discovery draws him back to society in search of scents that are capable of changing how he will be perceived by others, and eventually to learn the highest level of the art in the Grasse region of France. Once again he encounters a remarkable scent from a teenage girl, and this time engages in serial murder in order to practice the preserving of her scent with his perfumier's art. He is caught red-handed after this murder, but his sentence is not carried out, because he has by now developed a scent that causes people to fall in helpless awe and adoration of him. However this power does not bring him happiness and he realizes he is a misanthrope - someone who hates people, and he is left disillusioned. Finally he returns to Paris, where he is torn to pieces by a crowd who are so drawn to him due to his scent, that they became compelled to obtain and consume pieces of him. With translations into 48 languages and over 20 million copies sold to date worldwide, 'Perfume' is one of the largest book sales among 20th Century German novels. The title remained in bestseller lists for about 9 years, and received almost unanimously positive national and international critical acclaim. The novel was translated into English by John E. Woods and won the PEN Translation Prize in 1987. Some editions of Perfume, including the first, have as their cover image Antoine Watteau's painting Jupiter and Antiope, which depicts a sleeping woman. The novel is widely seen as an allegory for Hitler and his dramatic rise for power."

  "text" : "Passage of Arms (1959), by Eric Ambler, is a fast-paced thriller about the discovery of a cache of arms, abandoned by Communist insurgents in the Malayan jungle, and the later transfer of the arms via Singapore to Indonesia. The novel is structured as three connected stories. The outer, framing story is that of Girija Krishnan, the Tamil plantation clerk who finds the arms cache and sells it to raise money to fund his bus service company. Krishnan′s story of business ambition leads to the story of an entrepreneurial Chinese trading family who arrange the transferring of the arms. The central, third story features an American couple, Greg and Dorothy Nilsen, who are tourists of the Far East used to legitimize the transaction, and so find themselves in great danger — the recurrent theme of ″innocents abroad″ that characterizes the novels of Eric Ambler. As a novel, the narrative of Passage of Arms combines high and low humor, political and social suspense, and military action populated by vivid characters acting in ″exotic″ locales."

  "text" : "Programming Perl, best known as the Camel Book among programmers, is a book about writing programs using the Perl programming language, revised as several editions (1991-2012) to reflect major language changes since Perl version 4. Editions have been co-written by the creator of Perl, Larry Wall, along with Randal L. Schwartz, then Tom Christiansen and then Jon Orwant. Published by O'Reilly Media, the book is considered the canonical reference work for Perl programmers. With over a thousand pages, the various editions contain complete descriptions of each Perl language version and its interpreter. Examples range from trivial code snippets to the highly complex expressions for which Perl is widely known. The camel book editions are also noted for being written in an approachable and humorous style."

Additional rules, for use by Dungeon Masters (DMs), who referee the game, can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Many optional rules, such as those governing extremely high-level players, and some of the more obscure spells, are found in other sources. Since the first edition, the Player's Handbook has contained tables and rules for creating characters, lists of the abilities of the different character classes, the properties and costs of equipment, descriptions of spells that magic-using character classes (such as wizards or clerics) can cast, and numerous other rules governing gameplay. Both the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play. The Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual make up the core D&D rulebooks."

The book profiles senators who defied the opinions of their party and constituents to do what they felt was right and suffered severe criticism and losses in popularity because of their actions. It begins with a quote from Edmund Burke on the courage of the English Statesman, Charles James Fox, in his 1783 attack upon the tyranny of the East India Company in the House of Commons. The book focuses intensely on mid-19th century antebellum America and the efforts of Senators to delay the Civil War. Profiles was widely celebrated and became a best seller. John F. Kennedy is credited as the author, although the extent of his contribution has been questioned. In his 2008 autobiography, Kennedy's speechwriter Ted Sorensen wrote that, while Kennedy provided the theme and supervised its production, Sorensen had written most of the book."

  "text" : "Peace on Earth (Pokój na Ziemi [ˈpɔkuj na ˈʑɛmʲi] in Polish) is a 1987 science fiction novel by Stanisław Lem. The novel describes, in a satirical tone, the ultimate implications of the arms race. The evolution of artificial intelligence has allowed major world powers to sign a rather curious treaty: the Moon is divided into national zones (proportional to each nation's Earth real estate) and all weapons development and production must be moved there to be handled by factories. This is supposed to completely demilitarize Earth, achieving the long-sought dream of world peace. A MAD stabilizing factor is apparently preserved by the ability of countries, in case of war, to quickly ship weapons down from the Moon. Unknown to most people, a problem arises. The ever-increasing amount of autonomy given to Moon's automata, in order to conduct more-effective espionage in neighbors' nation facilities and also to defend one's own, leads to localized robotic conflicts on the Moon's surface. Eventually, after a number of events, there is a total discontinuation of any communication with the Moon. After a number of failed expeditions to reveal the truth on what is going on beneath the Moon's surface, Ijon Tichy is called to the rescue."

  "text" : "Plan of Attack is a 2004 book by the American author and investigative reporter Bob Woodward. It was promoted as \"a behind-the-scenes account of how and why President [George W.] Bush decided to go to war against Iraq\". The book's chief contention, which provides the rationale for its title, is that President Bush planned from early in his presidency to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force, rather than making any serious effort to use diplomacy or other means. The book describes White House deliberations implying that if Saddam were removed from power without a military invasion, Iraq would need a foreign-implemented regime change. It focuses mainly on President Bush, Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and CIA Director George Tenet, as well as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair. Other fixtures are White House advisers such as Karen Hughes and Karl Rove."

  "text" : "Post Captain is the second historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, first published in 1972. It features the characters of Captain Jack Aubrey and naval surgeon Stephen Maturin in the early 19th century and is set in the Napoleonic Wars. During the brief Peace of Amiens, Aubrey and Maturin live in a country house allowing both of them to meet the women they eventually will marry. Then their life is turned upside down when Aubrey loses his money due to decisions of the prize court and a dishonest prize-agent. When the war begins afresh, Aubrey has a command, seeing action while gaining fewer prizes yet succeeding in his military goals. The emotions of his love life interfere with his ways at sea. The novel was received well at its initial publishing, but received more and better notice after its re-issue in 1990. That much of the story is set on land drew some to consider it O'Brian's homage to Jane Austen, one of his favorite authors."

  "text" : "Paradiso is a novel by Cuban writer José Lezama Lima, the only one completed and published during his lifetime. Written in an elaborately baroque style, the narrative follows the childhood and youth of José Cemí, and depicts many scenes which resonate with Lezama's own life as a young poet in Havana. Many of the characters reappear in Lezama's posthumous novel Oppiano Licario, which was published in Mexico in 1977. The novel relates Cemí's struggles with a mysterious childhood illness, describes the death of his father, and explores his homosexuality and literary sensibilities. He lives in the world of pre-Castro Havana, and the Cuban Revolution only appears as a secondary plot. Some of the later chapters incorporate narrative experiments in which several alternating stories, set during widely divergent eras and having no immediately apparent connection with José Cemí, are interwoven and eventually merged. (In a letter to Julio Cortázar, Lezama explained that these chapters represent Cemí's dreams after the death of his father.) Because of the graphic homosexual scenes and the novel's ambivalence towards the political situation of the day, Paradiso encountered controversy and publication problems. Today it is widely read in the Spanish-speaking world but has not achieved the same fame in English-speaking countries despite a translation by Gregory Rabassa. Despite having written one of the most accomplished novels in Cuba's history, Lezama said he never considered himself a novelist, but rather a poet who wrote a poem that became a novel. Paradiso can thus be considered a kind of long poem, just as well as a neo-baroque novel. The novel was originally published in Cuba in an edition regarded by the writer Julio Cortázar as being highly unsatisfactory, in part because of Lezama's poor punctuation and stylistic errors. With Lezama's blessing, Cortázar personally edited the text for a subsequent Mexican edition, correcting \"thousands of errors and ambiguities.\""

  "text" : "Parade's End (1924-1928) is a tetralogy of novels by the British novelist and poet Ford Madox Ford (1873–1939). The setting is mainly England and the Western Front of the First World War, in which Ford had served as an officer in the Welch Regiment, a life he vividly depicts. The individual novels are: \n* Some Do Not ... (1924) \n* No More Parades (1925) \n* A Man Could Stand Up — (1926)  \n* Last Post (US title, The Last Post) (1928) The work is a complex tale written in a modernist style (\"it is as modern and modernist as they come\"), which does not concentrate on detailing the experience of war. Robie Macauley, in his introduction to the Borzoi edition of 1950, described it as \"by no means a simple warning as to what modern warfare is like... [but] something complex and baffling [to many contemporary readers]. There was a love story with no passionate scenes; there were trenches but no battles; there was a tragedy without a denouement.\" The novel is about the psychological result of the war on the participants and on society. In his introduction to the third novel, A Man Could Stand Up--, Ford wrote, \"This is what the late war was like: this is how modern fighting of the organized, scientific type affects the mind\". In December 2010, John N. Gray hailed the work as \"possibly the greatest 20th-century novel in English\" and Mary Gordon labelled it as \"quite simply, the best fictional treatment of war in the history of the novel\"."

  "text" : "Peyton Place is a 1956 novel by Grace Metalious. The novel describes how three women are forced to come to terms with their identity, both as women and as sexual beings, in a small, conservative, gossipy New England town, with recurring themes of hypocrisy, social inequities and class privilege in a tale that includes incest, abortion, adultery, lust and murder. It sold 60,000 copies within the first ten days of its release and remained on the New York Times best seller list for 59 weeks. The novel spawned a franchise that would eventually run through four decades. Twentieth Century-Fox adapted it as a major motion picture in 1957, and Metalious wrote a follow-up novel that was published in 1959, called Return to Peyton Place, which was also filmed in 1961 using the same title. The original 1956 novel was adapted again in 1964, in what became a wildly successful prime time television series for 20th Century Fox Television that ran until 1969, and the term \"Peyton Place\" - an allusion to any small town or group that holds scandalous secrets - entered into the American lexicon. An NBC daytime soap opera, titled Return to Peyton Place, ran from 1972 to 1974, and the franchise was rounded out with two made-for-television movies, which aired in 1977 and 1985."

Also, the subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle. The book was such a success that Porter soon produced a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (1915). Eleven more Pollyanna sequels, known as \"Glad Books\", were later published, most of them written by Elizabeth Borton or Harriet Lummis Smith. Further sequels followed, including Pollyanna Plays the Game by Colleen L. Reece, published in 1997. Pollyanna has been adapted for film several times. Some of the best known are Disney's 1960 version starring child actress Hayley Mills, who won a special Oscar for the role, and the 1920 version starring Mary Pickford."

  "text" : "Paper Lion is a 1966 non-fiction book by American author George Plimpton. In 1960, Plimpton, not an athlete, arranged to pitch to a lineup of professional baseball players in an All-Star exhibition, presumably to answer the question, \"How would the average man off of the street fare in an attempt to compete with the stars of professional sports?\" He chronicled this experience in his book, Out of My League. To write Paper Lion, Plimpton repeated the experiment in the National Football League, joining the training camp of the 1963 Detroit Lions on the premise of trying out to be the team's third-string quarterback. Plimpton, then 36 years old, showed how unlikely it would be for an \"average\" person to succeed as a professional football player. The book is an expanded version of Plimpton's two-part series which appeared in back-to-back issues of Sports Illustrated in September 1964. The book's epilogue is also an expanded article from Sports Illustrated which appeared one year later. Plimpton had contacted several teams about his idea including his hometown New York Giants and New York Titans (an American Football League team that would change their name to the New York Jets) and Baltimore Colts. The Lions finally agreed to host Plimpton in their training camp. The coaches were aware of the deception but the players were not until it became apparent that Plimpton did not know how to receive the snap from center. Despite his struggles Plimpton convinced head coach George Wilson to let him take the first five snaps of the annual intra-squad scrimmage conducted in Pontiac, Michigan. Plimpton managed to lose yardage on each play. Feeling confident he could do better, Plimpton hung around training camp one more week as the team prepared for its first pre-season game against the Cleveland Browns, being sure if the Lions had a big enough lead near the end of the game, Wilson would let him play. However, team officials informed Plimpton at halftime that NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle would not allow him to play under any circumstance. The next day Plimpton packed up and ended his experiment. Before he left, however, the Lions awarded him a gold football that was engraved: \"To the best rookie football player in Detroit Lions history.\" The book is memorable as one of the first to showcase the personalities of the players and coaches and what happens off the field. Figuring prominently in the book are linebacker Wayne Walker, quarterback Milt Plum, future Hall of Famers cornerback Dick \"Night Train\" Lane and middle linebacker Joe Schmidt, and defensive tackle Alex Karras, among others. However, Karras's inclusion is exclusively through the stories about him told by teammates, coaches and other team personnel. Karras missed the 1963 season serving a suspension for gambling on football games. Prior to Paper Lion, Plimpton had pitched to major league baseball players and sparred with boxing great Archie Moore, but the success of this book, which was later adapted into a 1968 film starring Alan Alda as Plimpton, helped launch a kind of second career for Plimpton as an everyman athlete. Plimpton followed Paper Lion with books about golf and ice hockey, as well as two more football books. In an interview with Tom Bean and Luke Poling, the filmmakers of the documentary, Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself, Joe Schmidt talked about how the team reacted to Plimpton's presence. \"He tried to blend in with the rest of the team, but after a while you could just see that George wasn't much of an athlete. You don't have to be a Rhodes Scholar to figure that one out. You're in training camp and you're all pretty good football players, and George comes along, and he's sort of emaciated looking, you know he's not too physical of a specimen. And he couldn't throw the ball more than 15 yards.\""

  "text" : "Plantae Asiaticae Rariores is a horticultural work (alternative title Descriptions and figures of a select number of unpublished East Indian plants) published in 1830–1832 by the Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich. Plantae Asiaticae Rariores was published in London, Paris and Strassburg between 1829 and 1832 and consisted of 3 volumes bound from the 12 original parts in folio size (21½ × 14½ inches) with 294 hand-coloured plates lithographed by Maxim Gauci. Wallich went on extended leave in 1828 to supervise the printing and hand-colouring of the illustrations in England. Foremost of the watercolour artists who executed the original paintings were two Indian artists, Vishnupersaud, responsible for 114 plates and Gorachand for 87. Vishnupersaud (occasionally referred to as Vishnu Prasad) was an Indian artist frequently employed by naturalists working in India, such as John Forbes Royle and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton. Vishnupersaud’s skill was legendary and Wilfrid Blunt included one of his watercolours in his book The Art of Botanical Illustration as displaying great craftsmanship. The remaining plates were done by Charles M. Curtis (7), William Griffith (3), Sarah Drake, and various others. A double-page engraved map of India created by John Arrowsmith, showed the routes followed by various botanists. A noteworthy point is that plate number 6 is an engraving by H. Weddell, and not a lithograph. Plantae Asiaticae was seen to follow naturally on William Roxburgh's Plants of the coast of Coromandel (London: 1795–1820) and was sponsored by the East India Company who subscribed to 40 copies. The 12 parts were sold at £2 10s each, between September 1829 and August 1832. Wallich writes in the introduction, \"The present Work consists of a selection of plants made chiefly from a series of 1200 drawings, executed under my direction by Native Artists.\" He goes on to praise the work of the lithographer Maxim Gauci and the colourist John Clark: \"For both of these worthy men and admirable artists I beg to express my sincere respect.\""

  "text" : "People of the Black Mountains is an historical novel by Raymond Williams. This book is a work in two volumes, published in 1989 and 1990. It features a great diversity of people in a single place across the ages. Most of them are ordinary people living unprivileged lives. It is told thorough a series of flashbacks featuring an ordinary man in modern times. He is looking for his grandfather who has not returned from a hill-walk, but has visions of the past as it might have been. It begins in the Old Stone Age and extends through to the Middle Ages, telling a series of fictionalized short stories about ordinary people in the Welsh-border region of the Black Mountains where he was born and grew up. The series is solidly based on what archaeologists have found – some of the tales are speculative reconstructions based on real burials. It has been praised for \"brilliant clarity and imaginative vision\" (Sunday Telegraph) and hailed as \"the great historic novel Wales has long deserved\" (Wales on Sunday). The story-sequence would have extended to modern times had Williams lived to finish it. What exists is a complete story arc extending from the Old Stone Age to the late-Mediaeval period. The story begins in the Old Stone Age and was intended to come right up to modern times, always focusing on ordinary people. He had completed it as mediaeval times when he died in 1988. It was prepared for publication by his wife Joy Williams and was published in two volumes, along with a Postscript that gives a brief description of what the remaining work would have been. Almost all of the stories were completed in typescript, generally revised many times by the author. Only one story, The Comet was left incomplete and needed some small additions to make a continuous narrative"

  "text" : "Past Mortem is a detective novel by Ben Elton first published in 2004. It is about a serial killer on the loose in England, mainly in the London area, and Scotland Yard's attempts at tracking him or her down. At the same time, Past Mortem raises a number of sociological, psychological and moral questions such as bullying, revenge, \"getting a life\" versus living in the past, domestic violence, and the changing market value of people as they get older. Apart from its serious aspects, the book also contains a lot of humour, especially when the respective private entanglements of Detective Inspector Edward Newson, the officer in charge of the police investigation, and his assistant, Detective Sergeant Natasha Wilkie, are described. However, as one critic put it, \"some of the descriptions of the sex scenes might prove a bit much for the faint-hearted\"."

  "text" : "Pieces of Modesty is a short story collection by Peter O'Donnell featuring his action heroine, Modesty Blaise, first published in 1972. It was O'Donnell's first such collection of stories (he would publish a second, Cobra Trap, decades later). The stories featured in this collection are: 1.  \n* \"A Better Day to Die\" 2.  \n* \"The Giggle-Wrecker\" 3.  \n* \"I Had a Date with Lady Janet\" 4.  \n* \"A Perfect Night to Break Your Neck\" 5.  \n* \"Salamander Four\" 6.  \n* \"The Soo Girl Charity\" Elements from some of these stories would appear in the Modesty Blaise comic strip which O'Donnell wrote concurrent with his book series. \"I Had a Date with Lady Janet\" is distinguished as the only Modesty Blaise tale to be told in the first person by Modesty's right-hand man, Willie Garvin. The stories in this collection predate the publication of the book by several years. In the 1960s they were planned for publication in a book that would have been illustrated by O'Donnell's comic strip artist, Jim Holdaway who died in 1970. That edition was never produced. Holdaway's illustrations for the stories exist and have been reprinted in various magazines. The stories were originally published as newspaper inserts in Australia in 1970, in a weekly called Pix, under the series title \"Pay for Your Holidays Book (1–6)\". The original order was: 1.  \n* Modesty Blaise and the Men of Salamander Four (3 January 1970) 2.  \n* A Perfect Night to Break Your Neck (10 January 1970) 3.  \n* A Better Day to Die (17 January 1970) 4.  \n* The Giggle Wrecker (24 January 1970) 5.  \n* The Soo Girl Charity (31 January 1970) 6.  \n* I Had a Date with Lady Janet (7 February 1970) All were illustrated and eight pages long. The artists were uncredited, though the front page illustrations are signed by Holdaway for the first five (and the last looks like Holdaway's work). The interior illustrations appear to be by a different artist. Pieces of Modesty is unusual in the Modesty Blaise canon as it was the only book in the series not published in its first edition by Souvenir Press, instead being published exclusively in paperback by Pan Books. In 1986, the American company Mysterious Press issued the book's first and (to date) only hardcover edition. In the 2000s, Souvenir Press began a series of reprints of the Modesty Blaise books, and after acquiring the rights, re-issued Pieces of Modesty in March 2010 with new cover artwork based on the original hardback edition of the first Modesty Blaise novel (as no first-edition hardback was published of Pieces of Modesty). In the early 1980s, a dramatic reading of the story \"I Had a Date with Lady Janet\" was released on cassette tape by Pickwick Talking Books, PTB611, featuring John Thaw."

  "text" : "Phantastes: A Faerie Romance for Men and Women is a fantasy novel written by George MacDonald, first published in London in 1858. It was later reprinted in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fourteenth volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in April 1970. The story centres on the character Anodos (\"pathless\", or \"ascent\" in Greek) and takes its inspiration from German Romanticism, particularly Novalis. The story concerns a young man who is pulled into a dreamlike world and there hunts for his ideal of female beauty, embodied by the \"Marble Lady\". Anodos lives through many adventures and temptations while in the other world, until he is finally ready to give up his ideals. The edition published in 1905 was illustrated by Pre-Raphaelite painter Arthur Hughes. C.S. Lewis wrote, concerning his first reading of Phantastes at age sixteen, \"That night my imagination was, in a certain sense, baptized; the rest of me[,] not unnaturally, took longer. I had not the faintest notion what I had let myself in for by buying Phantastes.\""

  "text" : "Per Fine Ounce is the title of an unpublished novel by Geoffrey Jenkins featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond. It was completed c.1966 and is considered a \"lost\" novel by fans of James Bond because it was actually commissioned by Glidrose Productions, the official publishers of James Bond. It was rejected for publication, however, missing the opportunity to become the first continuation James Bond novel. The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½, a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott, was later published in 1967 featuring James Bond's nephew; Colonel Sun written by Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham was published in 1968 as the first adult continuation novel following Ian Fleming's The Man with the Golden Gun (1965)."

  "text" : "Philosophy in the Boudoir (La philosophie dans le boudoir) is a 1795 book by the Marquis de Sade written in the form of a dramatic dialogue. Though initially considered a work of pornography, the book has come to be considered a socio-political drama. Set in a bedroom, the two lead characters make the argument that the only moral system that reinforces the recent political revolution is libertinism, and that if the people of France fail to adopt the libertine philosophy, France will be destined to return to a monarchic state. In the chapter titled \"Fifth Dialogue\", there is a lengthy section where the character Chevalier reads a philosophical pamphlet titled \"Frenchmen, Some More Effort If You Wish To Become Republicans\". The pamphlet clearly represents Sade's philosophy on religion and morality, a philosophy he passionately hopes the citizens of France will embrace and codify into the laws of their new republican government. Continually throughout the work, Sade makes the argument that one must embrace atheism, reject society's beliefs about pleasure and pain, and further makes his argument that if any crime is committed while seeking pleasure, it cannot be condemned."

  "text" : "Philosophie Zoologique (\"Zoological Philosophy: Exposition with Regard to the Natural History of Animals\") is hat 1809 book by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, in which he outlines his pre-Darwinian theory of evolution now known as Lamarckism. In the book, Lamarck named two supposed laws that would enable animal species to acquire characteristics under the influence of ass environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths. Lamarck was largely ignored by the major French zoologist Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection."

  "text" : "Piece of Cake is a 1983 novel by Derek Robinson which follows a fictional Royal Air Force fighter squadron through the first year of World War II, and the Battle of Britain. It was later made into a television series. Although a work of fiction, the novel purports to be as historically accurate as possible. Notable themes are the development of aerial warfare tactics, the Hawker Hurricane fighter, the British class system within its military, and the difficulty of training and integrating new pilots during wartime. The novel was controversial because it challenged the greatly inflated number of British claims of Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed during the Battle of Britain, and theorized that the air battle was \"irrelevant\" to the possibility of a Nazi invasion of Britain following the fall of France. Robinson defends his work by stating that the truth of \"faults and deficiencies\" only enhances admiration for the courage and resilience of RAF pilots."

The nameless narrator, a Jarrell-like figure who teaches at a women's college called Benton, makes humorous observations about his students and, especially, his fellow academics, in particular the offensively tactless novelist Gertrude, modeled on Mary McCarthy. Some believe Benton was modeled after Sarah Lawrence College, where Jarrell taught. However, in an interview with the New York Times, Jarrell stated that \"Benton is supposed to be just a type ... I've taken things from real places, but mostly have made them up.\""

It was written and illustrated by Dorothy Kunhardt, who was a successful children's author when she created Pat the Bunny for her 3-year-old daughter, Edith. It was partly an experiment in using interactive elements in a book, which was unusual at the time."

  "text" : "Panzer Leader (German: Erinnerungen eines Soldaten, literally \"Memories of a Soldier\") is an autobiography by Heinz Guderian. The book, written during his imprisonment by the Allies after the war, describes Guderian's service in the Panzer arm of the Heer before and during World War II. Guderian's insights are important because of his association with the Panzer forces from a very early period, his high rank and involvement in many of the most important mobile operations of the war, and his eventual rise to Inspector General of Armored Troops, which involved him into regular direct interaction with Hitler and Speer in their high-level decision-making of the conduct of the last year of the war. In Panzer Leader, page 13, he said: In this year (1929) I became convinced that tanks working on their own or in conjunction with infantry could never achieve decisive importance. My historical studies; the exercises carried out in England and our own experience with mock-ups had persuaded me that the tanks would never be able to produce their full effect until weapons on whose support they must inevitably rely were brought up to their standard of speed and of cross-country performance. In such formation of all arms, the tanks must play the primary role, the other weapons beings subordinated to the requirements of the armor. It would be wrong to include tanks in infantry divisions: what was needed were armored divisions which would include all the supporting arms needed to fight with full effect. The most prominent English language version is the 1952 translation by Constantine Fitzgibbon, with a foreword by Captain B. H. Liddell Hart. The Da Capo Press editions have an additional introduction by Kenneth Macksey."

  "text" : "Possession: A Romance is a 1990 bestselling novel by British writer A. S. Byatt that won the 1990 Booker Prize. The novel explores the postmodern concerns of similar novels, which are often categorised as historiographic metafiction, a genre that blends approaches from both historical fiction and metafiction. The novel follows two modern-day academics as they research the paper trail around the previously unknown love life between famous fictional poets, Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. Possession is set both in the present day and the Victorian era, pointing out the differences between the two time periods, and satirizing such things as modern academia and mating rituals. The structure of the novel incorporates many different styles, including fictional diary entries, letters and poetry, and uses these styles and other devices to explore the postmodern concerns of the authority of textual narratives. The title Possession highlights many of the major themes in the novel: questions of ownership and independence between lovers; the practice of collecting historically significant cultural artifacts; and the possession that biographers feel toward their subjects. The novel was adapted as a feature film by the same name in 2002, and a serialised radio play that ran from 2011–2012 on BBC Radio 4. In 2005 Time Magazine included the novel in its list of 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. In 2003 the novel was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read."

  "text" : "Political Liberalism is a 1993 book by John Rawls, an update to his earlier A Theory of Justice (1971). In it, he attempts to show that his theory of justice is not a \"comprehensive conception of the good\" but is instead compatible with a liberal conception of the role of justice, namely, that government should be neutral between competing conceptions of the good. Rawls tries to show that his two principles of justice, properly understood, form a \"theory of the right\" (as opposed to a theory of the good) which would be supported by all reasonable individuals, even under conditions of reasonable pluralism. The mechanism by which he demonstrates this is called \"overlapping consensus\". Here he also develops his idea of public reason. An expanded edition of the book was published in 2005. It includes an added introduction, the essay \"The Idea of Public Reason Revisited\" (1997) — some 60 pp. — and an index to the new material."

The title alludes to a disparaging comment by the playwright Seán O'Casey, who, in a letter to The Daily Telegraph in July 1941, referring to Wodehouse's radio broadcasts from Berlin, wrote that \"If England has any dignity left in the way of literature, she will forget for ever the pitiful antics of English literature's performing flea\". The letters are introduced and annotated by Townend, who had provided Wodehouse with the inspiration for his character Ukridge. The United States version of the book, entitled Author! Author!, was published on 20 June 1962 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York. It was substantially reworked, with commentary by Wodehouse replacing much of Townend's contribution."

  "text" : "Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw, named after a Greek mythological character. It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador's garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women's independence. In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights, including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea first presented in 1871. Shaw would also have been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw's play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the musical My Fair Lady and the film of that name. Shaw mentioned that the character of Professor Henry Higgins was inspired by several British professors of phonetics: Alexander Melville Bell, Alexander J. Ellis, Tito Pagliardini, but above all, the cantankerous Henry Sweet."

  "text" : "Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc, by the Sieur Louis de Conte is an 1896 novel by Mark Twain that recounts the life of Joan of Arc. It is Twain's last completed novel, published when he was 61 years old. The novel is presented as a translation (by \"Jean Francois Alden\") of memoirs by Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of Joan of Arc's page, Louis de Contes. The novel is divided into 3 sections according to Joan of Arc's development: a youth in Domrémy, a commander of the army of Charles VII of France, and a defendant at trial in Rouen. Originally, the novel was published as a serialization in Harper's Magazine beginning in April 1895. Twain, aware of his reputation as a comic, asked that each installment appear anonymously so that readers will treat the piece seriously. Regardless, his authorship soon became known, and the book edition published by Harper and Brothers in May 1896 credited Mark Twain."

  "text" : "Paris in the Twentieth Century (French: Paris au XXe siècle) is a science fiction novel by Jules Verne. The book presents Paris in August 1960, 97 years in Verne's future, where society places value only on business and technology. Written in 1863 but first published 131 years later (1994), the novel follows a young man who struggles unsuccessfully to live in a technologically advanced, but culturally backwards world. Often referred to as Verne's \"lost novel\", the work paints a grim, dystopian view of a technological future civilization. Many of Verne's predictions were remarkably on target. His publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, would not release the book because he thought it was too unbelievable, and its sales prospects would be inferior to Verne's previous work, Five Weeks in a Balloon."

  "text" : "Prometheus Rising is a book by Robert Anton Wilson first published in 1983. It is a guide book of \"how to get from here to there\", an amalgam of Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of consciousness, Gurdjieff's self-observation exercises, Alfred Korzybski's general semantics, Aleister Crowley's magical theorems, Sociobiology, Yoga, relativity, and quantum mechanics, amongst other approaches to understanding the world around us, and claiming to be a short book (under 300 pages) about how the human mind works and how to get the most use from one. Wilson describes it as an \"owner's manual for the human brain\". The book examines many aspects of social mind control and mental imprinting, and provides mind exercises at the end of every chapter, with the goal of giving the reader more control over how one's mind works. The book has found many readers among followers of alternative culture, and discusses the effect of certain psychoactive substances and how these affect the brain, tantric breathing techniques, and other methods and holistic approaches to expanding consciousness. It draws a parallel between the development of one's mind and the development of higher intelligence theorized by biological evolution. Prometheus Rising was copyrighted and published in 1983 but began as Wilson's Ph.D. dissertation called \"The Evolution of Neuro-Sociological Circuits: A Contribution to the Sociobiology of Consciousness\" in 1978-79 for Paideia University in California. In 1982, while in Ireland, Wilson rewrote the manuscript for commercial publication, removing footnotes, improving the style, adding chapters and exercises, and sketching out diagrams for the illustrations. Eventually Wilson submitted the work to New Falcon Publications, which accepted it within 48 hours. Wilson received his advance 48 hours after that, according to his preface in the tenth printing of Prometheus Rising. The current edition also includes an introduction by Israel Regardie."

  "text" : "Poor Things is a novel by Scottish writer Alasdair Gray, published in 1992. It won the Whitbread Novel Award in 1992 and the Guardian Fiction Prize for 1992. The novel was called \"a magnificently brisk, funny, dirty, brainy book\" by the London Review of Books and is a departure from Gray's usual subject-matter of Glasgow realism and fantasy. However, its Victorian narrative takes in Gray's previous concerns with social inequalities, relationships, memory and identity."

Pyongyang is located on the Taedong River about 110 kilometres (68 mi) upstream from its mouth on the West Korea Sea and, according to preliminary results from the 2008 population census, has a population of 3,255,388. The city was split from the South Pyongan province in 1946. It is administered as a directly governed city (chikhalsi, 직할시) on the same level as provincial governments, as opposed to a special city (teukbyeolsi, 특별시) as Seoul is in South Korea."

It appeared in the US later in the same year published by Dodd, Mead and Company under the title Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The collection comprises twelve of her fourteen stories featuring detective James Parker Pyne; the two remaining stories, Problem at Pollensa Bay and The Regatta Mystery were later collected in The Regatta Mystery in 1939 in the US and in Problem at Pollensa Bay in the UK in 1991 although these were originally stories featuring Hercule Poirot when they were first published in the Strand Magazine in 1935 and 1936 respectively. The book also features the first appearance of the characters of Ariadne Oliver, and Miss Felicity Lemon, both of whom would go on to have working relationships with Hercule Poirot in later books."

He expects to be found out at any moment. When an English archaeologist arrives on the island, Pascali is suspicious of him, and the archaeologist's involvement with the woman Pascali loves creates further tensions."

  "text" : "Platform (French: Plateforme) is a 2001 novel by French writer Michel Houellebecq (translated into English by Frank Wynne). It has received both great praise and great criticism, most notably for the novel's apparent condoning of sex tourism and anti-Muslim feelings. The author was charged for inciting racial and religious hatred after describing Islam as \"stupid\", but saw charges dismissed. A play in Spanish based on the book, adapted and directed by Calixto Bieito, premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh International Festival."

It was published to mark Christie's eightieth birthday and, by counting up both UK and US short-story collections to reach the desired total, was also advertised as her eightieth book. It is the last of her spy novels. At the beginning of the book there is a quote by Jan Smuts, \"Leadership, besides being a great creative force, can be diabolical ...\" It is one of only four Christie novels to have not received an adaptation of any kind (such as screen, stage or radio) and one of only five of her novels to have not received a screen adaptation - the others being Death Comes as the End, Destination Unknown, Postern of Fate and Crooked House."

The book has been frequently reprinted and translated into 14 languages. It is reported that more than 200,000 copies were sold in the period of 1978 to 2001. The first edition of the book had the full title Meditation; commonsense directions for an uncommon life (1978). A second edition in 1991 was subtitled a simple eight-point program for translating spiritual ideals into daily life, and a third, revised edition of the book was published posthumously as Passage Meditation; Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart Into Daily Life (2008). A fourth, revised edition was published as Passage Meditation: A Complete Spiritual Practice: Train Your Mind and Find a Life that Fulfills (2016). The fourth edition included a new part, not contained in earlier editions, with approximately 80 pages of \"Questions and Answers\" to numerous questions about meditation (pp. 182-264)."

  "text" : "Pinball, 1973 (1973年のピンボール Sen-Kyūhyaku-Nanajū-San-Nen no Pinbōru) is a novel published in 1980 by Japanese author Haruki Murakami. The second book in the \"Trilogy of the Rat\" series, it is preceded by Hear the Wind Sing (1979) and followed by A Wild Sheep Chase (1982), and is the second novel written by Murakami. All three books in the Trilogy of the Rat have been translated into English, but Pinball, 1973, and Hear The Wind Sing, the first two books in the trilogy, were only printed as English translations in Japan by Kodansha under their Kodansha English Library branding, and both only as A6-sized pocket editions. Before being reprinted in 2009, these novels were difficult to locate and quite expensive, especially outside Japan. Murakami is alleged to have said that he did not intend these novels to be published outside Japan. Whether or not this is true, both novels are much shorter than those that follow and make up the bulk of his work, and are less evolved stylistically. The title reflects that of the well-known Oe Kenzaburo novel, The Silent Cry, which in the original Japanese is titled Football, First Year of the Man'en Era [1860] (万延元年のフットボール Man'en Gannen no Futtoboru). An omnibus English edition of Murakami's first two novels (Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973), under the title Wind/Pinball, with translations by Prof. Ted Goossen of York University, was released in the United States in August, 2015."

  "text" : "Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science (German: Prolegomena zu einer jeden künftigen Metaphysik, die als Wissenschaft wird auftreten können) is a book by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, published in 1783, two years after the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason. One of Kant's shorter works, it contains a summary of the Critique‘s main conclusions, sometimes by arguments Kant had not used in the Critique. Kant characterizes his more accessible approach here as an \"analytic\" one, as opposed to the Critique‘s \"synthetic\" examination of successive faculties of the mind and their principles. The book is also intended as a polemic. Kant was disappointed by the poor reception of the Critique of Pure Reason, and here he repeatedly emphasizes the importance of its critical project for the very existence of metaphysics as a science. The final appendix contains a detailed rebuttal to an unfavorable review of the Critique. In the standard Akademie edition of Kant's works, the Prolegomena takes up part of Volume IV."

  "text" : "Passage is a science fiction novel by Connie Willis, published in 2001. The novel won the Locus Award for Best Novel in 2002, was shortlisted for the Nebula Award in 2001, and received nominations for the Hugo, Campbell, and Clarke Awards in 2002. Passage follows the efforts of Joanna Lander, a research psychologist, to understand the phenomenon of near-death experiences (or NDEs) by interviewing hospital patients after they are revived following clinical death. Her work with Dr. Richard Wright, a neurologist who has discovered a way to chemically induce an artificial NDE and conduct an \"RIPT\" brain scan during the experience, leads her to the discovery of the biological purpose of NDEs. Science fiction scholar Gary K. Wolfe writes, \"Willis tries something truly astonishing: without resorting to supernaturalism on the one hand or clinical reportage on the other, without forgoing her central metaphor, she seeks to lift the veil on what actually happens inside a dying mind.\" Through Lander's work, Dr. Wright is able to develop a medicine that brings patients back from clinical death. The novel contains enlightening discussions of various disasters, including the RMS Titanic, the Hartford circus fire, the Hindenburg disaster, the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, the Boston Molasses Disaster, and, almost as prominently as the Titanic, the sinking of the USS Yorktown. (Willis has written extensively in several novels about events in World War II.)"

  "text" : "Port of Saints is a novel by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs. First published in 1973, it was the last major work Burroughs wrote during his self-imposed exile in Europe during the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of Burroughs' shorter novels, the book utilizes characters from numerous earlier works, and also introduces characters that would re-appear later in the Burroughs canon. Described as an \"erotic fantasy\", the novel (as explained by Burroughs scholar Jenny Skerl) consists of several plotlines shuffled together, with the \"main\" plot loosely dealing with a group of wild boys that seek to rewrite history by travelling through time to various times and places. Burroughs spent the rest of the decade writing shorter works and essays. His following novel was Cities of the Red Night, published in 1981. The same year Port of Saints was released, Burroughs also published the short story collection Exterminator! and several chapbooks. A revised edition of the novel was published in 1980."

They journey north to New York City, where Pic bears witness to the economic 'hard times' his brother is experiencing. After losing not one, but two jobs in one day, his brother sends his pregnant girlfriend to live with her sister in San Francisco, as the two boys try to hitch and bum their way across the country. It is written in a voice that is stereotypically black. It is out of print and currently available only as a single volume with either of Kerouac's novels Satori in Paris and The Subterraneans."

The work is an extensive treatise on the subject of abjection, in which Kristeva draws on the theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to examine horror, marginalization, castration, the phallic signifier, the \"I/Not I\" dichotomy, the Oedipal complex, exile, and other concepts appropriate to feminist criticism and queer theory. According to Kristeva, the abject marks a \"primal order\" that escapes signification in the symbolic order; the term is used to refer to the human reaction (horror, vomit) to a threatened breakdown in meaning caused by the loss of the distinction between subject and object, or between the self and the other."

  "text" : "Philosophical Fragments (Danish title: Philosophiske Smuler eller En Smule Philosophi) is a Christian philosophic work written by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard in 1844. It was the first of three works written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, the other two were Johannes Climacus, 1841 and Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, 1846. Kierkegaardian scholars D. Anthony Storm and Walter Lowrie believe Kierkegaard could be referring to Johannes Climacus, a 7th-century Christian monk, who believed that an individual is converted to Christianity by way of a ladder, one rung (virtue) at a time. Kierkegaard believes the individual comes to an understanding with Christ by a leap. Kierkegaard scholar and translator David F. Swenson was the first to translate the book into English in 1936. He called it \"Philosophical Chips\" in an earlier biography of Kierkegaard published in 1921and another early translator, Lee Milton Hollander, called it \"Philosophic Trifles\" in his early translation of portions of Kierkegaard's works in 1923. Kierkegaard hinted that he might write a \"sequel in 17 pieces\" in his preface. By February 22, 1846 he published a 600-page sequel to his 83-page Fragments. He devoted over 200 pages of Concluding Unscientific Postscript to an explanation of what he meant by Philosophical Fragments. He referred to a quote by Plato in his Postscript to Philosophical Fragments: \"But I must ask you Socrates, what do you suppose is the upshot of all this? As I said a little while ago, it is the scrapings and shavings of argument, cut up into little bits.\" – Greater Hippias, 304a. He could have been thinking about this quote when he wrote this book. Plato was asking \"What is beauty?\" Kierkegaard asks, \"What is Truth?\" Kierkegaard had already asked about truth 9 days earlier when he published Three Upbuilding Discourses. A mere 4 days from the publication of Philosophical Fragments he published The Concept of Anxiety. Kierkegaard wrote his books in reaction to both Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel as well as the philosophic-historical use of speculation in regard to Christianity. Schlegel published a book bearing the same title as Kierkegaard's, Philosophical Fragments in 1799."

  "text" : "Peter and the Starcatchers is a best-selling children's novel that was published by Hyperion Books, a subsidiary of Disney, in 2004. Written by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, the book provides a backstory for the character Peter Pan, and serves as a prequel to J. M. Barrie's novel Peter and Wendy. It was illustrated by artist Greg Call. The book is followed by three sequels, also set before the famous adventure with Peter and Wendy: Peter and the Shadow Thieves (2006), Peter and the Secret of Rundoon (2007), and Peter and the Sword of Mercy (2009). A fifth book titled The Bridge to Neverland was released in September 2011. A series of Never Land chapter books for younger readers is based on the novels. In 2005, Disney hired Jay Wolpert to adapt the book to film, reportedly to use 3D animation. A play with music adaptation of the book debuted in winter 2009 at La Jolla Playhouse, as part of an arrangement with Disney Theatrical. It was re-staged Off-Broadway in 2011 and opened on Broadway April 15, 2012, at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. On May 17, 2012 Walt Disney Pictures announced that a film version of the book would be written by Jesse Wigutow. On August 20, 2012, \"The Hunger Games\" director Gary Ross agreed to direct the movie. Filming was expected to begin in 2013."

  "text" : "Piccadilly Jim is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 24 February 1917 by Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, and in the United Kingdom in May 1918 by Herbert Jenkins, London. The story had previously appeared in the US in the Saturday Evening Post between 16 September and 11 November 1916. The novel features Ogden Ford and his mother Nesta (both previously encountered in The Little Nugget (1913)). Nesta has remarried, to the hen-pecked, baseball-loving millionaire Mr. Peter Pett, and Ogden remains spoilt and obnoxious. The story takes its title from the charismatic character of Jimmy Crocker, Nesta's nephew and a reforming playboy. 'Jim' is called upon to assist in the kidnapping of Ogden, amongst much confusion involving imposters, crooks, detectives, butlers, aunts etc. - all in the name of romance of course."

It deals with the reigns of Egyptian pharaohs Akhenaten and Tutankhamun and the Exodus from the perspective of a Hittite slave girl of Ankhesenpaaten. It draws heavily on Ahmed Osman's theory that Moses and Ankhenaten were the same person. The idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars starting with Sigmund Freud's views in Moses and Monotheism. Tarr comments in the endnotes that she was surprised at how little she had to tweak historical fact to write the story. The audiobook version, published in 1998, ran for approximately 22 hours and was read by Anna Fields."

It was first serialized in six parts in Argosy in 1932 and published in book form two years later by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. The events occur on a fictionalized version of the planet Venus, known as \"Amtor\" to its inhabitants. The novel contains elements of political satire aimed at communism. The novel's villains, the Thorists, start a revolution in the nation of Vepaja for their own good only, cheating the uneducated masses and killing or driving away those doctors and other highly educated that form the foundation of the society. Throughout the book the Thorists remain distant and unreal, and those few that the hero Carson Napier meets are often stupid or incompetent. The Kalkars, villains of Burroughs' other novel The Moon Maid, were also modeled on the Russian Communists.)"

The protagonist of the novel is the feckless Dan Milligan, a man so lazy that the author is obliged to take direct action to prevent him spending the entire novel lounging about at home; thus alerted to his status as a fictional character, Dan frequently breaks the fourth wall, speaking directly to the writer about the trouble he has been made to endure."

Penned by Samuel Vedanayagam Pillai (1826-1889), it was a landmark in Tamil literature, which had hitherto seen writings only in poetry. The book gave birth to a new literary genre and Tamil prose began to be recognized as an increasingly important part of the language. The author was the munsif (a 'Village President' with some judicial powers) of Mayuram (present day Mayiladuthurai near Thanjavur). Influenced by Western ideas of women's liberation and secularism, he set out to publish works that projected his ideals. His first publication was Pen Kalvi (\"Female Education\"), which he addressed to his daughters. After witnessing the explosion of novels in Western literature, he set out to publish his groundbreaking novel that would showcase the heroine of the novel as an equal of the hero, if not more savvy and righteous. The story revolves around the protagonist, Prathapa Mudaliar and his travails."

Singaporean playwright Alfian Sa'at adapted the novel into the play Happy Endings: Asian Boys Vol. 3. It was staged by W!LD RICE, a Singapore theatre company, from 11 to 29 July 2007. It was reprinted in 2008."

  "text" : "Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth: The Remedy is an 1879 book by the social theorist and economist Henry George, a treatise on the questions of why poverty accompanies economic and technological progress and why economies exhibit a tendency toward cyclical boom and bust. George uses history and deductive logic to argue for a radical solution focusing on the capture of economic rent from natural resource and land titles. Progress and Poverty is Henry George's first book, which sold several million copies, exceeding all other books except the Bible during the 1890s. It helped spark the Progressive Era and a world-wide social reform movement around an ideology now known as 'Georgism'. Jacob Riis, for example, explicitly marks the beginning of the Progressive Era awakening as 1879 because of the date of this publication. The Princeton historian Eric F. Goldman wrote this about the influence of Progress and Poverty: \"For some years prior to 1952 I was working on a history of American reform and over and over again my research ran into this fact: an enormous number of men and women, strikingly different people, men and women who were to lead 20th century America in a dozen fields of humane activity, wrote or told someone that their whole thinking had been redirected by reading Progress and Poverty in their formative years. In this respect no other book came anywhere near comparable influence, and I would like to add this word of tribute to a volume which magically catalyzed the best yearnings of our fathers and grandfathers.\" Progress and Poverty had perhaps even a larger impact around the world, in places such as Denmark, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, where Henry George's influence was enormous. Contemporary sources and historians claim that in the United Kingdom, a vast majority of both socialist and classical liberal activists could trace their ideological development to Henry George. George's popularity was more than a passing phase; even by 1906, a survey of British parliamentarians revealed that the American author's writing was more popular than Walter Scott, John Stuart Mill, and William Shakespeare. In 1933, John Dewey estimated that Progress and Poverty \"had a wider distribution than almost all other books on political economy put together.\""

  "text" : "Planet X (ISBN 0671019163) is a 1998 Star Trek novel by Michael Jan Friedman which is a crossover between the X-Men comic book series and the characters of Star Trek: The Next Generation. A New York Times bestseller, it was a sequel to an earlier crossover, detailed in the Marvel Comics one-shot Second Contact (which was itself similar to an earlier Star Trek/X-Men crossover comic, where a slightly different team of X-Men encountered the characters of the original Star Trek series). The novel is noteworthy for hinting at an attraction between Jean-Luc Picard and Ororo Munroe (Storm), and made a forward-looking reference to the (then uncast) X-Men feature film by remarking on the uncanny resemblance between Picard and Xavier, as the two converse via the holodeck after a reasonable facsimile of Xavier is programmed into it; (both characters were played by Patrick Stewart in Star Trek: The Next Generation and the X-Men film series)."

  "text" : "Pocket Ref is a comprehensive, all-purpose pocket-sized reference book/handbook and how-to guide containing various tips, tables, maps, formulas, constants and conversions by Thomas J. Glover. It is published by Sequoia Publishing, and is currently in its fourth edition at 864 pages in length, released in late 2010. It contains references, tables, and instructional guides on such varied subjects as automotive repair; carpentry and construction; chemistry and physics; computers; physical, chemical, and mathematical constants; electronics; money and measurement conversions; advanced first aid; glue, solvents, paints, and finishes; hardware; mine, mill, and aggregate; plumbing; zip codes; rope, cable, and knots; steel and metals; surveying and mapping; and more. Described as an \"oracle of all things DIY,\" the Pocket Ref has been featured on the television series MythBusters. In the \"Shop 'til You Drop\" episode, Adam Savage noted that \"nearly everyone\" had asked him about the little black book. The Pocket Ref is available at many hardware stores, in addition to book stores and online. The Pocket Ref is often imprinted with the name of a hardware store or other third party on its front cover. Although the Pocket Ref is printed on very thin paper, its page count is still limited by the publisher's desire for it to fit in a standard shirt pocket, so a more comprehensive work, at 1280 pages, DeskRef, has been published. Glover is also the author of Pocket PC Ref, Deskref, Handyman In-Your-Pocket, Pocket Do It Yourself Source, Measure for Measure and Tech Ref. Comparable books include AutoRef by Glover's sometime-coauthor Richard A. Young, and Pocket Partner \"a comprehensive collection of vital information for law enforcement personnel\" by Dennis Evers."

  "text" : "Polaroids from the Dead is a collection of short stories and essays by Douglas Coupland. The theme is that each story is written from a collection of old polaroids Coupland found in a drawer. It is an attempt to describe the 1990s, a decade that \"seemed to be living in a 1980s hangover\". Topics of the stories include a Grateful Dead concert (source of \"The Dead\" in title), a post-mortem letter to Kurt Cobain, Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge, and an homage to James Rosenquist's painting F-111. The book's ends with a longer essay on Brentwood, California, home to Marilyn Monroe's grave, and the O. J. Simpson murder case. The essay is in part a collage of menus, scraps of conversation, and postings from bulletin boards."

It was published on September 27, 1850 under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus, the author of The Sickness Unto Death. Kierkegaard considered it to be his \"most perfect and truest book\". In it, the theologian fully exposes his conception of the religious individual, the necessity of imitating Christ in order to be a true Christian and the possibility of offense when faced with the paradox of the incarnation. Practice is usually considered, along with For Self-Examination and Judge for Yourselves!, as an explicit critique of the established order of Christendom and the need for Christianity to be (re-)introduced into Christendom, since a good part of it consists in criticism of religious thinkers of his time."

  "text" : "Phoenix in Obsidian (alternate title: The Silver Warriors) is a science fantasy novel by Michael Moorcock. First published in 1970, it is the second book in a series that follows the adventures of the Eternal Champion as he is flung from one existence to another. The first book in the series, The Eternal Champion, told the story of John Daker, an average 20th-century man who suddenly found himself incarnated as Erekosë, a legendary hero of Earth in the distant past (or distant future). He had been called to lead humanity against its Eldren foes, but ended up taking the Eldren's side. Phoenix in Obsidian continues the story, which is concluded in The Dragon in the Sword. The trilogy is part of a larger cycle about the Eternal Champion as defender of the Multiverse. Having resolved the human-Eldren war, Erekosë finds himself once again called to a strange world to defend Earth from invaders. This time he is Count Urlik Skarsol, Lord of the Frozen Keep, sleeping hero of a frozen and dying Earth. At Rowernarc, the Obsidian City, he hears of the Silver Warriors from the Moon, which long ago crashed into the other side of the Earth. But nobody in Rowernarc seems to fear them—nobody, indeed, seems concerned with anything but whiling away the time until death. With nothing to do and no foe to fight, Erekose wonders who could have called him and searches for a way to return to his lost love. In The Eternal Champion, Erekosë bore the sword Kanajana, a weaker version of Stormbringer. As Urlik, he finds the Black Sword in its purest, most virulent form. Like Stormbringer, Urlik's Cold Sword is vampiric and sentient, and it demands the blood of friends as the price for its aid. The title Phoenix in Obsidian comes from a scene halfway through the book, when Erekosë, in the guise of Urlik, spends a short time in an obsidian cave. He reflects that he is like a phoenix, immortal by virtue of being reborn time and again, yet he is trapped in the obsidian cave like a fly in amber."

  "text" : "Poison (original Norwegian title: Gift) is an 1883 novel by the Norwegian writer Alexander Kielland. The novel is the first in a trilogy including Fortuna (1884) and St. Hans Fest (1887). This famous novel is an attack on the Norwegian education system, particularly on the obsession with Latin. A schoolboy, Marius, is tormented throughout the first half of the novel by his scholastic inability, and during his final illness continues to murmur rote phrases, his last words being Mensa rotunda. The main character of the book is Marius's friend Abraham Løvdahl, the son of a respected professor. His mother Wenche is an idealist who struggles in vain to keep her son honest and upright; she takes her own life after falling pregnant to the businessman Michal Mordtmann. In Norwegian, gift can mean both \"poison\" and \"married,\" making the title of the novel ambiguous. However, the conventional interpretation is that the title means \"poison\", as the students are \"poisoned\" by rote learning of topics unrelated to real life and societal norms. In both cases, the etymology is the same, namely something that is \"given.\" It is the same word as the English word \"gift\", adopted from Old Norse."

  "text" : "(\"McCartney\" redirects here. For other uses, see McCartney (disambiguation).) Sir James Paul McCartney, MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, one of the most popular and influential groups in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is one of the most celebrated of the 20th century. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. McCartney has been recognised as one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song \"Yesterday\", more than any other copyrighted song in history. Wings' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and a 21-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009 he has 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr all received The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1965, and in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. He has married three times and is the father of five children."

  "text" : "Private Parts is the first book written by American radio personality Howard Stern. Released on October 7, 1993 by Simon & Schuster, it is the fastest-selling book in the company's history. It was later adapted into a film in 1997 starring Stern and his radio show staff as themselves. The early chapters are autobiographical, covering Stern's upbringing and early career, while later chapters are more in the style of a memoir, covering recurring themes from his radio show such as sex, flatulence, and celebrities. Stern's choices for the title were I, Moron, Mein Kampf, and Penis (the last was considered as Stern thought it would lead to the amusing newspaper headline \"Howard Stern's Penis is a bestseller\") but were refused by the publisher, although Mein Kampf would be used as the title of the book's fifth chapter regarding the beginning of his career. They then compromised with the title Private Parts, suggested by Stern's co-host Robin Quivers, which Stern liked as a sexual pun referring to the personal \"private parts\" of his life with a popular euphemism for genitalia. The book received mixed reviews from critics, often drawing comparisons to Lenny Bruce's How to Talk Dirty and Influence People. Like Stern's radio show, it received a great deal of opposition due to its content. It is number 86 on the American Library Association's list of the \"100 Most Frequently challenged books Between 1990 and 1999.\" A paperback edition was released in September 1994, where Pocket Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, printed a further 2.8 million copies. In late 1995, Stern published a second book called Miss America."

The most important of these expeditions was in the winter of 1947–48. During his travels Mowat studied the lives of the Ihalmiut, a small population of Inuit people, whose existence depended heavily on the large population of caribou in the region. Besides descriptions of nature and life in the Arctic, Mowat's book tells the sad story of how a once prosperous and widely dispersed people slowly dwindled to the brink of extinction due to unscrupulous economic interest and lack of understanding."

  "text" : "Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally \"love of wisdom\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, \"philosophy\" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, \"natural philosophy\" encompassed astronomy, medicine and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy? Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (\"concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being\"), epistemology (about the \"nature and grounds of knowledge [and]...its limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science and the history of Western philosophy. Since the 20th century professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors, researchers and writers. However, many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law, journalism, politics, religion, science, business and various art and entertainment activities."

It was first published in Portuguese in 1968, and was translated by Myra Ramos into English and published in 1970. The book is considered one of the foundational texts of critical pedagogy. Dedicated to what is called \"the oppressed\" and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults to read and write, Freire includes a detailed Marxist class analysis in his exploration of the relationship between what he calls \"the colonizer\" and \"the colonized\". In the book Freire calls traditional pedagogy the \"banking model\" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a piggy bank. However, he argues for pedagogy to treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge. The book has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide."

  "text" : "Portuguese Irregular Verbs is a short comic novel by Alexander McCall Smith, and the first of McCall Smith's series of novels featuring Professor Dr von Igelfeld. It was first published in 1997. Some consider the book to be a series of connected short stories. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, a pompous professor of Romance languages, graduates college, works hard to write a tome on Portuguese irregular verbs, his claim to academic fame. He talks and talks about it at conferences, usually attending with his two closest colleagues. They encounter the world outside academia with entertaining clumsiness. One review says the main character is \"a gentle figure who deserves every cartoon anvil that falls on his head\", in the humorous tradition of fictional characters Mr. Samuel Pickwick (in The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens), Bouvard and Pécuchet (in an unfinished work by Gustave Flaubert), and Mr. Poole of Diary of a Nobody. Another reviewer considers the book to be a series of connected short stories, \"gentle farces\", \"where much is made of nothing -- to great comic effect.\" That reviewer likens the stories to E. F. Benson's Lucia books."

Most of the poems in the collection were also incorporated into de Camp's later poetry collection, Heroes and Hobgoblins, though again with a different arrangement. The poems \"African Night,\" \"Beholder,\" \"Delra Beach, Florida,\" \"Farewell to Adam,\" \"Glamour,\" the nine \"Jorian's Jingles,\" \"The Ghost,\" \"The Irish,\" and \"To My Library\" are unique to this collection. \"Acrophobia,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Night,\" \"Time,\" and \"To R.E.H.\" are shared with Demons and Dinosaurs only. \"A Glass of Goblanti,\" \"A Night Club in Cairo,\" \"Art,\" \"Bear on a Bicycle,\" \"Bourzi,\" \"Carnac,\" \"Disillusion,\" \"Ghost Ships,\" \"Jewels,\" \"Leaves,\" \"Mother and Son,\" \"Preferences,\" \"Tehuantepec,\" \"Teotihuacán,\" \"The Elephant,\" \"The Hippopotamus,\" \"The Home of the Gods,\" \"The Indian Rhinoceros,\" \"The Iron Pillar of Delhi,\" \"The Lizards of Tula,\" \"The Mantis,\" \"The Newt,\" \"The Old-Fashioned Lover,\" \"The Olmec,\" \"The Other Baghdad,\" \"The Reaper,\" \"The Saviors,\" \"The Trap,\" \"Thoth-Amon's Complaint,\" \"Tiger in the Rain,\" and \"Xeroxing the Necomonicon\" are shared with Heroes and Hobgoblins only. The remaining poems are common to all three collections. The \"Jorian\" to whom the nine poems designated \"Jorian's Jingles\" are attributed is a character and occasional poet in de Camp's fantasy novels The Goblin Tower (1968) and The Clocks of Iraz (1971), in which most of them were originally published."

It is one of the first forays that Sharadindu took in the realm of creating a mature logical detective moulded in the pattern of Sherlock Holmes in the Bengali language, and one that Bengalis could immediately identify with. As such, it is not as well-drawn out as some of Sharadindu's later works and relies heavily on Sherlock Holmes and Holmesian deductive reasoning for inspiration."

The setting of the novel is Cairo during and just after World War I. Palace Walk is the first book of the Cairo Trilogy, set in Cairo, Egypt. It begins in 1917, during World War I, and ends in 1919, the year of the nationalist revolution. The book's Arabic title translates literally into 'between two palaces' - a phrase which highlights the cultural and political transition Egypt experienced at this time, developments brought into focus by the lives of the el-Gawad family."

According to Bloch, Universal Pictures loathed the novel, which was intended to critique Hollywood splatter films. A different story was created for the film and Bloch was not invited to any screenings. Universal suggested that Bloch abandon his novel, which he declined and released anyway to good sales."

  "text" : "Plain Tales from the Hills (published 1888) is the first collection of short stories by Rudyard Kipling. Out of its 40 stories, \"eight-and-twenty\", according to Kipling's Preface, were initially published in the Civil and Military Gazette in Lahore, Punjab, British India, between November 1886 and June 1887. \"The remaining tales are, more or less, new.\" (Kipling had worked as a journalist for the CMG—his first job—since 1882, when he was not quite 17.) The title refers, by way of a pun on \"Plain\" as the reverse of \"Hills\", to the deceptively simple narrative style; and to the fact that many of the stories are set in the Hill Station of Simla—the \"summer capital of the British Raj\" during the hot weather. Not all of the stories are, in fact, about life in \"the Hills\": Kipling gives sketches of many aspects of life in British India. The tales include the first appearances, in book form, of Mrs. Hauksbee, the policeman Strickland, and the Soldiers Three (Privates Mulvaney, Ortheris and Learoyd)."

McCaughrean was selected following a competition launched in 2004, in which novelists were invited to submit a sample chapter and plot outline. The book continues the story of the Lost Boys, the Darling family, and Peter Pan, in 1926 during the reign of George V and following World War I. The book was released internationally on 5 October 2006. The first United Kingdom printing consisted of a standard run of approximately 30,000 copies, and a limited edition of 1,500 copies with a specially printed bookplate, individually numbered, and signed by the author. Five copies of a special edition, leather bound in a slipcase were also printed, one of each went to the author, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Oxford University Press, HM The Queen (Patron of Great Ormond Street Hospital) and the last one was auctioned at the book launch. In Britain it was released with a cover illustration and interior silhouettes by David Wyatt, and in the United States with a cover illustration by Tony DiTerlizzi. The US edition features interior silhouette illustrations by Scott M. Fischer. The book was also released in audio format in the UK and US. A new edition, fully illustrated in colour by David Wyatt, abridged by Geraldine McCaughrean for younger readers, was published in the UK in October 2008 by Oxford University Press."

  "text" : "Princess Diana's Revenge is a novel written by the English writer Michael de Larrabeiti and self-published in 2006, under the imprint \"Tallis House\", which is the name used by de Larrabeiti for publishing his own works. In the context of de Larrabeiti's other works, it is perhaps closest in tone to his thrillers The Bunce and The Hollywood Takes, dealing with conspiracy theories and partly featuring the documentary film business in which de Larrabeiti's earlier novels were set. Despite de Larrabeiti being an established author of thirty years standing, Princess Diana's Revenge was turned down by his literary agents, Curtis Brown. The novel was then turned down by over thirty publishers in the United Kingdom. In response to this de Larrabeiti decided to self-publish under his own imprint, \"Tallis House\". He is one of the first established authors to self-publish, along with the Canadian writer Jim Munroe. The book tells the story of Joe Rapps, a director and cameraman who slips into the surreal world of Milton Magna, an Oxfordshire village which is based on the real village of Great Milton where de Larrabeiti lived for over thirty years. Rapps is drawn into various conspiracy theories revolving around the Friends of Diana, a cult which has grown up around the memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, and is determined to avenge her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. Although the book is not as explicitly anti-authoritarian as de Larrabeiti's most famous work, The Borrible Trilogy, its satire of members of the Royal Family ensure that the book is run-through with the anti-authoritarianism that is present in all of de Larrabeiti's work."

The original German language edition, Psychologische Typen, was first published by Rascher Verlag, Zurich in 1921. Extensive detailed abstracts of each chapter are available online. In the book Jung categorized people into primary types of psychological function. He proposed four main functions of consciousness: \n* Two perceiving functions: Sensation and Intuition \n* Two judging functions: Thinking and Feeling The functions are modified by two main attitude types: extraversion and introversion. Jung theorized that the dominant function characterizes consciousness, while its opposite is repressed and characterizes unconscious behavior. The eight psychological types are as follows: \n* Extraverted sensation \n* Introverted sensation \n* Extraverted intuition \n* Introverted intuition \n* Extraverted thinking \n* Introverted thinking \n* Extraverted feeling \n* Introverted feeling In Psychological Types, Jung describes in detail the effects of tensions between the complexes associated with the dominant and inferior differentiating functions in highly and even extremely one-sided types."

  "text" : "Passing is a novel by American author Nella Larsen, first published in 1929. Set primarily in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the 1920s, the story centers on the reunion of two childhood friends, Clare Kendry and Irene Redfield, and their increasing fascination with each other's lives. The title and central theme of the novel refer to the practice of racial \"passing\"; Clare Kendry's passing as white with her white husband, John (Jack) Bellew, is its most significant depiction in the novel, and a catalyst for the tragic events. Larsen's exploration of race was informed by her own mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality. As one of only two novels by Larsen, Passing has been significant to her ranked at the forefront of several literary canons and has been the subject of considerable scholarly criticism."

  "text" : "Pleasant Dreams is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones released on July 20, 1981, through Sire Records. While the band members wanted Steve Lillywhite to produce, Sire chose Graham Gouldman in an attempt to gain popularity through a well-known recording manager. The recording process brought about many conflicts between band members, most notably the strife between Joey Ramone and Johnny Ramone, where Johnny began dating one of Joey's ex-girlfriends. There were also disputes about the overall genre of the album, with Johnny leaning towards hard rock and Joey towards pop music. Ultimately, the album incorporated a high production value and a variation of tone throughout the album. Pleasant Dreams featured songs such as \"We Want the Airwaves,\" \"She's a Sensation,\" and \"Come On Now,\" strayed from traditional punk rock and took on different styles. The album was not commercially acclaimed, which came as a surprise to Sire since they had insisted the band record with Gouldman in an effort to increase fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums."

The book is a first-hand account of Slim Fast founder Abraham's more than 15 years of peacemaking efforts in the Middle East, as well as the various reasons he believes peace is possible. Hillary Clinton spoke about Abraham's book at Princeton University, while recognizing the creation of the \"S. Daniel Abraham Visiting Professorship in Middle East Policy Studies\" and its first holder, Daniel C. Kurtzer. The book is utilized as a resource by Case Western Reserve University, and the United States Air Force utilizes other books by Abraham as part of Middle-East peace workshops. With former congressman Wayne Owens, Abraham established the Center for Middle East Peace & Economic Cooperation. Abraham's work on peace is also featured as part of the Clinton Global Initiative."

  "text" : "Patience and Sarah is a 1969 historical fiction novel with strong lesbian themes by Alma Routsong, using the pen name Isabel Miller. It was originally self-published under the title A Place For Us and eventually found a publisher as Patience and Sarah in 1971. Routsong's novel is based on a real-life painter named Mary Ann Willson who lived with her companion Miss Brundage as a \"farmerette\" in the early 19th century in Greene County, New York. Routsong said she came upon Willson's work in a folk art museum in Cooperstown and was inspired to write the story after reading the description of Willson and Brundage. It tells the story of two women in Connecticut in 1816 who fall in love and decide to leave their homes to buy a farm in another state or territory and live in a Boston marriage. The story addresses the limited opportunities and roles of women in early America, gender expression, and the interpretation of religion in everyday life. Sarah Waters, author of Tipping the Velvet and other historical novels with lesbian themes, has said that this book was an influence on her writing. She received the book from a girlfriend in 1988 at age 22 and was \"struck by the lyricism and economy of it, by its gentle humour, and by its sexiness.\""

The collection's only hardcover edition is The Fantasies of Harlan Ellison, which compiles it together with Ellison's \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\". The general theme that runs through each of these stories is the rejection of the establishment and the fight of the individual against a corrupt authority. \"\"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman\", \"Wanted In Surgery\", and \"The Crackpots\" are particularly famous examples of this theme in Ellison's work."

  "text" : "Prince of Annwn is a fantasy novel by Evangeline Walton, the first in a series of four based on the Welsh Mabinogion. Originally intended for publication by Ballantine Books as a volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, it actually saw print only after the series was discontinued. It was first published in paperback by Ballantine Books in November 1974. It has been reprinted a number of times since, and gathered together with Walton's other Mabinogion novels by Overlook Press as the omnibus The Mabinogion Tetralogy in 2002. The novel has also been published in translation in several European languages. The other three novels in the series are The Island of the Mighty (1936), The Children of Llyr (1971), and The Song of Rhiannon (1972). The novel is a retelling of the story of the First Branch of the Mabinogion, Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed (Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed), and hence is chronologically the first of Walton's Mabinogion novels, though published last."

  "text" : "Pagan Operetta (1998) is a collection of poetry and experimental prose by Carl Hancock Rux, his first poetry collection. It won the 1999 Village Voice Literary Prize. Rux subsequently adapted one section for stage performance, initially also under the title Pagan Operetta, later as The No Black Male Show. Loosely inspired by Homer's Odyssey, the collection is structured as a poetic memoir. Rux begins the first section with reflections on his early childhood in foster care after the death of his grandmother, his biological mother's schizophrenia and institutionalization, questions regarding his father's identity, and his adoptive parents' spousal abuse, and concludes it with a surreal short story entitled \"Asphalt\" (which inspired his novel of the same name) about a boy walking through the ruins of an urban landscape as rose buds blossom from his skin. The second section details a life-changing experience in Ghana, where the protagonist goes to avoid a dying childhood friend and discovers shantytowns and an illiterate teenager who seduces middle-aged tourists and has a sexual encounter with a prostitute that ends badly. The third section is a collection of poems posing socio-political questions, among them the commodification of the tragic black male identity and the challenge facing young writers. In these poems, Rux recalls pondering \"black male identity\" while watching a play by Anton Chekhov with Cornel West and attending a party seated next to a dying Allen Ginsberg."

  "text" : "Pole to Pole is an eight-part television documentary travel series made for the BBC, and first broadcast on BBC1 in 1992. The presenter is Michael Palin, this being the second of Palin's major journeys for the BBC. The first was Around the World in 80 Days, a 7-part series first broadcast on BBC One in 1989, and the third was Full Circle with Michael Palin, a 10-part series first broadcast on BBC One in 1997. The trip from the North Pole to the South Pole went via Scandinavia, the Soviet Union, parts of Europe, and through the heart of Africa. The intention was to follow the 30 degree east line of longitude, which would cover the most land. A last-minute diversion to Chile included South America in the series. Using aircraft as little as possible, the whole trip lasted 5½ months. The programme has been sold to many television stations around the world. It was also released on video tape and later on DVD. Following the trip Michael Palin wrote Pole to Pole describing the trip. This book contains much more detail than could be presented in the TV programme, and Palin's personal views are also more clearly evident. The book contains many pictures from the trip, almost all taken by Basil Pao, the stills photographer on the team."

  "text" : "Please Understand Me: Character and Temperament Types is a psychology book written by David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates which focuses on the classification and categorization of personality types. The book contains a self-assessed personality questionnaire, known as the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, which links human behavioral patterns to four temperaments and sixteen character types. Once the reader's personality type has been ascertained, there are detailed profiles which describe the characteristics of that type. Based upon the notion that peoples' values differ fundamentally from one another, Keirsey drew upon the views of several psychologists or psychiatrists: Ernst Kretschmer, Erich Adickes, Alfred Adler, Carl Jung and Isabel Myers who are all mentioned as predecessors in the psychology of temperament or personality. Of these methods, preference is given to the Myers–Briggs test when determining personality type."

Anderson prequel, Dune: House Corrino. Following the events of Dune, Paul Atreides is in control of the all-important planet Arrakis and therefore the entire universe. Former Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has been deposed and exiled, but plots to return to power. The Fremen jihad in Paul's name rages as he himself sees to the accuracy of his consort Princess Irulan's chronicle of his life story. Paul flashes back to his memories of the War of Assassins which played out in his youth, before his family relocated to Arrakis in Dune."

  "text" : "Principles of Political Economy (1848) by John Stuart Mill was one of the most important economics or political economy textbooks of the mid-nineteenth century. It was revised until its seventh edition in 1871, shortly before Mill's death in 1873, and republished in numerous other editions. Beside discussing descriptive issues such as which nations tended to benefit more in a system of trade based on comparative advantage (Mill's answer: those with more elastic demands for other countries' goods), the work also discussed normative issues such as ideal systems of political economy, critiquing proposed systems such as communism and socialism. Along with A System of Logic, Principles of Political Economy established Mill's reputation as a leading public intellectual. Mill's sympathetic attitude in this work and in other essays toward contemporary socialism, particularly Fourierism, earned him esteem from the working class as one of their intellectual champions."

  "text" : "Postcards from No Man's Land is a young-adult novel by Aidan Chambers, published by Bodley Head in 1999. Two stories are set in Amsterdam during 1994 and 1944. One features 17-year-old visitor Jacob Todd during the 50-year commemoration of the Battle of Arnhem, in which his grandfather fought; the other features 19-year-old Geertrui late in the German occupation of the Netherlands. It was the fifth of six novels in the series Chambers calls \"The Dance Sequence\", which he inaugurated in 1978 with Breaktime. Chambers won the annual Carnegie Medal, from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. In 2001 The Guardian named it one of ten books recommended for teenage boys, and called it a \"seriously good and compulsively readable novel that spans 50 years and two interwoven stories of love, betrayal and self-discovery\". Postcards from No Man's Land was first published in the U.S. by Dutton in 2002. There it won the Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association recognising the year's best book for young adults. WorldCat reports that Postcards is the work by Chambers most widely held in participating libraries, by a wide margin. One library catalogue record recommends Postcards for American \"senior high school\" students and the British librarians call it a \"sophisticated book for older teenagers. Issues of euthanasia and sexual identity are raised. This is an emotionally and intellectually challenging book and one that lingers in the mind.\""

  "text" : "Pornified: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families is a 2005 book by American writer Pamela Paul, discussing the impact of ready access to pornography on Americans. The book was selected as one of the best books of 2005 by The San Francisco Chronicle and was a New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice. Social conservatives such as Albert Mohler, President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, endorsed the book enthusiastically, though he predicted it might \"find a chilly reception in a society increasingly given over to the titillation, perversion, and profits offered by pornography.\" The Washington Post Book World characterized the book as \"A persuasive argument that today’s pornography is not the Playboy centerfold or the Deep Throat of yesteryear…Paul’s remedy charts a sensible middle ground between restraints and free speech.\" Sex columnist Amy Sohn, on the other hand, cared less for the book and argued in the New York Times Book Review that \"Paul never gives credence to the many women who enjoy consuming porn, alone or with partners.\""

Published during the 2008 presidential campaign candidacy of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, they provide historical context for the relationship between the Mormons and the American Presidency. The book has 43 chapters, one for each president from George Washington to George W. Bush. Each chapter explores the relationship between a President of the United States and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS Church). Political figures, such as Utah Senator Orrin Hatch (a member of the LDS Church), as well as academics, such as the University of Florida's Kenneth Wald, have praised it. The documentary includes interviews with dozens of experts who share their experiences or stories they know about the interactions between the Mormons and the Presidents of the United States. Academics such as Columbia University's Richard Bushman participate, as do politicos such as U.S. Senator Bob Bennett and former Senator Jake Garn. The book's author, Mike Winder, narrates. The talk CD is a one-hour \"fireside\" address, also by Mike Winder, summarizing some of the more colorful anecdotes in the book."

  "text" : "Patriot Reign is a best-selling book by Boston Globe/New York Times sports writer Michael Holley resulting from two years he was given unprecedented access to the inner sanctums of the world champion New England Patriots football operations, as they worked to turn a season of good luck into a legitimate contender of a team. The book was published in 2004 by the William Morrow subsidiary of Harper-Collins books. Holley spent his days tracking the behind the scenes operations in the New England Patriots organization between their first and second Super Bowl wins, sitting in on meetings, and never being asked to exclude anything. Prohibited from nothing, Holley roamed the managerial meetings and team areas normally closed to the press, and conducted in depth interviews with scouts, coaches, and other Patriots insiders, up to and including owner Robert Kraft, and his son, President of the Patriots, Jonathan Kraft. Holley followed the team, day-to-day, from within the organization for nearly two full seasons as coach and de facto general manager Bill Belichick resumed the building of a model NFL franchise. The team's progression, ironically, was interrupted by the Patriots' unexpected over victory over the St Louis Rams — nicknamed \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" — in Super Bowl XXXVI. Shortly after the surprise victory, Holley pitched his book concept to Belichick. The idea was rubber stamped by the Krafts, and Holley took a leave of absence from his work at the Globe to immerse himself in the New England Patriots. In February 2009, the book was cited by syndicated radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh discussed the passages in the book dealing with Belichick's philosophy that he found to be instructive on his program."

While the book is largely about cricket, it also tells of how the tour had an impact that went far beyond sub-continental cricket in terms of the goodwill and sense of bonhomie it created between the people of the two countries, thereby encouraging peaceful relations. Published in 2005, it was Rahul Bhattacharya's first book, and received wide appreciation within cricketing circles. In 2010 it was voted number four of the Ten Best Cricket Books of all time in The Wisden Cricketer. He covered the tour for The Guardian and The Wisden Cricketer."

The story of the Mahabharata in Parva is narrated in the form of personal reflections of some of the principal characters of the epic. Parva is unique in terms of the complete absence of any episode that has the element of divine intervention found in the original. Considered to be Bhyrappa's greatest work, Parva remains one of Bhyrappa's widely debated and popular works."

  "text" : "Philip Hall Likes Me, I Reckon Maybe is a children's novel written by Bette Greene that was awarded a Newbery Honor in 1975. The book was published in 1974 by Puffin Books. It is the first of three novels to feature protagonist Beth Lambert and her friend Philip Hall. The sequels are titled Get On Out of Here, Philip Hall, and I've Already Forgotten Your Name, Philip Hall. The book is set in rural Arkansas in the late 20th century. Eleven-year-old Beth Lambert is second-best at almost everything in school, from math to sports. She doesn't mind, though, because she's second only to Philip Hall. Over the course of the novel, she begins to grapple with the idea that perhaps she's letting Philip beat her so he'll remain her friend."

  "text" : "Pioneers of American Freedom: Origin of Liberal and Radical Thought in America is a book by the German anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker about the history of liberal, libertarian, and anarchist thought in the United States. Rudolf Rocker, who had been strongly influenced by Benjamin Tucker, started work on Pioneers of American Freedom during World War II. Professor Arthur E. Briggs started translating the book into English from Rocker's native German in 1941. He took over for Rocker's previous English translator Ray E. Chase as he had died. The book was published with the help of the Rocker Publishing Committee in 1949. The first part of the book consists of a series of essays on the American liberal thinkers Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Abraham Lincoln. Rocker emphasizes the importance these men assign to individualism, freedom, and the subordination of the state to the welfare of the individual. This, Rocker claims, is a great similarity between anarchist and liberal thought. The second part deals with American anarchists. Among those covered in the book are Josiah Warren, Stephen Pearl Andrews, Lysander Spooner, William Batchelder Greene, Ezra Heywood, and Benjamin Tucker. Rocker argues that these anarchists' emphasis on \"free competition of individual and social forces as something inherent in human nature, which if suppressed will inevitably lead to the destruction of the social equilibrium\" distinguishes them from authoritarian socialists. He claims that the problem in modern society is not too much competition, but a lack of it as the result of \"the destructive forces of monopoly\". Further, Rocker seeks to dispel the myth that radicalism in the United States was merely a foreign import, pointing to the fact that most of the thinkers covered by the book were undoubtedly American by descent and born in the New England states. In fact, he argues, they were active \"before any modern radical movements were even thought of in Europe\" and they were more influenced by the American Declaration of Independence than by any European thinker. Roger Nash Baldwin said of Pioneers of American Freedom: \"No American has been able to write such an analysis of our heretics and idealists.\" The Mississippi Valley Historical Review claimed the essays made no new contribution and considered the discussion of Lincoln inferior. The journal's review does, however, credit Rocker with \"bringing together in an orderly discussion of all the important American material on philosophical anarchism before World War I\". Joseph Dorfman, in his review in the Journal of Political Economy, credits Rocker with writing one of the first treatments of American radical history, considering it a \"welcome supplement\" to Eunice M. Schuster's Native American Anarchism."

  "text" : "Panic Spring is a novel by Lawrence Durrell, published in 1937 by Faber and Faber in Britain and Covici-Friede in the United States under the pseudonym Charles Norden. It is set on a fictional Greek Island, Mavrodaphne, in the Ionian Sea somewhere between Patras, Kephalonia, and Ithaca. The island, however, resembles Corfu strongly, and in at least one inscribed copy of the novel, Durrell includes a map of Corfu identified as Mavrodaphne. The novel progresses through multiple perspectives in the successive chapters, each focusing on a different character. As a whole, the novel shows Durrell's myriad influences of this period, ranging from Remy de Gourmont to Richard Aldington, D. H. Lawrence, and several Elizabethan writers."

Proven Guilty had a release date of May 2, 2006. Harry Dresden has spent years being watched and suspected by the White Council's Wardens. But now he is a Warden, and it's a worse role than he thought. So when movie monsters start coming to life on his watch, it's officially up to him to put them back where they came from. Only this time, his client is the White Council, and his investigation cannot fail—no matter who falls under suspicion, no matter the cost. The cover art by illustrator Christian McGrath depicts Harry on a street corner with his glowing staff. On Butcher's website, the first 3 chapters may be previewed."

The novel was first published in English translation in 1938 because the German-language edition printed in Vienna was confiscated and destroyed by the Nazis in 1938. Only in 1942 the book appeared in German language, published by Albert Müller in Zürich, illustrated by Hans Bertle. Before a successful German-language release, the book was translated also into Hungarian in 1938, into Danish in 1939 and into Swedish in 1940; a French translation followed in 1943, a Slovak one in 1947 and a Dutch one in 1952. In 1957, Walt Disney adapted it into a True Life Fantasy of the same name."

The book has received reviews from The New York Times Book Review, New York Observer, New York Post, and Reuters. The Observer credits the book with \"debunking the most absurd of the baby-marketers’ claims—including those behind the infamous Baby Einstein series.\" The Times, however, noted that the book concerns itself mostly with the situation of families in wealthy urban and suburban communities. A week later, the New York Times Book Review named the book an \"Editors' Choice\""

The novel covers the (mis)adventures of an Italian soldier during World War II. The offspring of an English father and an Italian mother, the eponymous main character of the novel found himself unwillingly drafted into the Italian army, with Count Pontefiore, Commanding Officer of the 914th Regiment of Tuscan Infantry, as his colonel. Not only was the Count Angelo's patron, but he was also a former lover of Angelo's mother. The novel opened with the Italian armistice of 1943, and traced the fortunes of Angelo as he sought to survive and regain a measure of control over his life during the turmoils of the war. Though distinctly lacking in dono di coraggio (gift of courage), an annoying but life-saving characteristic, Angelo strove to main his cheerfulness and beautiful voice in chaotic circumstances beyond his control."

Pirate Diary won the annual Kate Greenaway Medal from the professional librarians, recognising the year's best-illustrated children's book published in the U.K. (Riddell),and the Blue Peter Book Award, Best Book with Facts.It was also silver runner up for the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize in ages category 6–8 years. The Greenaway press release celebrated Pirate Diary as an \"exciting information book for children from 8 to 14\" and the first \"information book\" to win the illustration Medal since 1975, and called it \"a fictionalised account\" (quoting CILIP). \"[W]hen he spoke with author Richard Platt the harsh necessities of historical accuracy came into play. 'Everything I got excited about got shot down. No parrots, eye-patches or wooden legs. Thank god there were weapons and amputations!'\" (quoting Riddell)."

  "text" : "Perceptrons: an introduction to computational geometry is a book written by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert and published in 1969. An edition with handwritten corrections and additions was released in the early 1970s. An expanded edition was further published in 1987, containing a chapter dedicated to counter the criticisms made of it in the 1980s. The main subject of the book is the perceptron, an important kind of artificial neural network developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The main researcher on perceptrons was Frank Rosenblatt, author of the book Principles of Neurodynamics. Rosenblatt and Minsky knew each other since adolescence, having studied with a one-year difference at the Bronx High School of Science. They became at one point central figures of a debate inside the AI research community, and are known to have promoted loud discussions in conferences. Despite the dispute, the corrected version of the book published after Rosenblatt's death contains a dedication to him. This book is the center of a long-standing controversy in the study of artificial intelligence. It is claimed that pessimistic predictions made by the authors were responsible for an erroneous change in the direction of research in AI, concentrating efforts on so-called \"symbolic\" systems, and contributing to the so-called AI winter. This decision, supposedly, proved to be unfortunate in the 1980s, when new discoveries showed that the prognostics in the book were wrong. The book contains a number of mathematical proofs regarding perceptrons, and while it highlights some of perceptrons' strengths, it also shows some previously unknown limitations. The most important one is related to the computation of some predicates, as the XOR function, and also the important connectedness predicate. The problem of connectedness is illustrated at the awkwardly colored cover of the book, intended to show how humans themselves have difficulties in computing this predicate."

According to Stephanie's file Hart stole a necklace from a pawn shop owned by Stanley Cramp and shot him in the foot. Vinnie is worried that if Hart isn't brought in soon he won't be able to afford the big champagne Valentine's Day cruise he is supposed to take with his wife Lucille. Diesel is back and he's hunting down Bernie Beaner. Bernie's marriage of thirty-five years has apparently gone down the crapper and he's blaming another Unmentionable for it, Annie Hart. Until Diesel can take care of Bernie Beaner he's keeping Annie Hart in protective custody. The only problem is that Annie won't give up her work and has Diesel promise to make sure all of her clients have a good Valentine's Day. Diesel passes this task off to Stephanie for a hundred dollars and a promise that she won't have to do anything illegal or life-threatening."

The concept behind the book in the Introduction: “The construction and payoff of jokes and the construction and payoff of philosophical concepts are made out of the same stuff. They tease the mind in the same ways…philosophy and jokes proceed from the same impulse: to confound our sense of the way things are, to flip our worlds upside down, and to ferret out hidden, often uncomfortable, truths about life. What the philosopher calls an insight, the gagster calls a zinger.\""

Parliament reached the top 5 on Canadian best seller lists. The paperback release in 1992 was a similar commercial success. The book received an overwhelmingly positive critical reception. Time Magazine called it \"a riotously funny and perceptive indictment of America's political system\". The New York Times called it \"a funnily savage attack on the political authorities of the United States\". In a piece about its 1992 paperback release, USA Today described it as \"the anthem of this political year\"."

  "text" : "Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration Into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel is a book by theoretical physicist Michio Kaku. Kaku uses discussion of speculative technologies to introduce topics of fundamental physics to the reader. The topic of invisibility becomes a discussion on why the speed of light is slower in water than in vacuum, that electromagnetism is similar to ripples in a pond, and Kaku discusses newly developed composite materials. The topic of Star Trek \"phasers\" becomes a lesson on how lasers work and how laser-based research is conducted. The cover of his book depicts a TARDIS, a device used in the British science fiction television show Doctor Who to travel in space and time, in its disguise as a police box, continuously passing through a time loop. With each discussion of science fiction technology topics he also \"explains the hurdles to realizing these science fiction concepts as reality\"."

  "text" : "Pendragon or Pen Draig, meaning in Welsh \"head (Pen) dragon (Draig) \" or \"chief dragon\" (a figurative title referring to status as a leader and shortened from Pen y Ddraig (pronounced Thraig hard 'th' as in 'then')), is the name of several traditional Kings of the Britons: Ambrosius Aurelianus, son of Constantine II of Britain (called \"Pendragon\" in the Vulgate Cycle); Uther, brother of Aurelius and father of King Arthur (called \"Uther Pendragon\" because he was inspired by a dragon-shaped comet); King Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon; and Maelgwn of Gwynedd, described by Gildas as the \"dragon of the island.\" In the Historia Regum Britanniae, one of the earliest texts of the Arthurian legend, only Uther is given the surname \"Pendragon\", which is explained as meaning \"dragon's head\". In the prose version of Robert de Boron's Merlin, the name of Uther's elder brother Ambrosius is given as \"Pendragon\", while Uter (Uther) changes his name after his brother's death to \"Uterpendragon\". The use of \"Pendragon\" to refer to Arthur, rather than to Uther or his brother, is of much more recent vintage. In literature, one of its earliest uses to refer to Arthur is in Alfred Tennyson's poem Lancelot and Elaine, where, however, it appears as Arthur's title rather than his surname, following contemporary speculation that \"pendragon\" had been a term for an ancient Welsh war-chief. Mark Twain in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court makes various satirical and scathing remarks about \"The Pendragon Dynasty\" which are in fact aimed at ridiculing much later British dynasties."

  "text" : "Polysexuality is the tenth issue of the journal Semiotext(e), designed to illustrate \"the plural aspects of sexuality.\" Edited by Canadian psychoanalyst François Peraldi, it was first published in 1981. The work reproduces images of genocide, massacre, and political disaster. According to Sylvére Lotringer, the purpose of these images was not to communicate terror and despair, but rather to connect sexuality to all the other flows that permeate society and to represent the death drive. They were intended to communicate ecstasy or jouissance. Polysexuality was reprinted in 1995, in a new edition noting that Peraldi had died of AIDS in 1993. It reprinted material by writers and philosophers such as Pierre Klossowski, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Félix Guattari, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, William S. Burroughs, Paul Virilio, Georges Bataille, Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes, and Guy Hocquenghem, together with an introduction written by François Peraldi. It contains thirteen chapters: \"Self Sex\", \"Soft Sex\", \"Alimentary Sex\", \"Sex of the Gaze\", \"Ambiguous Sex\", \"Animal Sex\", \"Child Sex\", \"Morbid Sex\", \"Violent Sex\", \"Discursive Sex\", \"Philosophical Sex\", and \"Critical Sex\". The anthology was attacked in the United States Congress for its alleged advocacy of bestiality."

  "text" : "Physicist and Christian: A dialogue between the communities (1961) is a book by William G. Pollard. Much of the attention given to the book such as its review in Time magazine has been attributed to the fact that Pollard was not only a well-respected physicist but also an Anglican priest. The book deliberately avoids specific subject matter differences, focusing on religion and science both as human communities. An important theme is the idea that human knowledge—scientific or religious—can be developed only by those, like Pollard, who have \"fully and freely\" given themselves to a human community, whether to the physics community or Christian community or some other, e.g., the United States Marine Corps. Also an important theme is Pollard's argument and cautions against a cultural norm in which scientific knowledge would be objective and public, on the one hand, while religious knowledge would be subjective and private, on the other."

This was Brautigan's last self-publishing venture and came out in an edition of 6,000. The entire edition was offered for free distribution, and permission to reprint the collection was explicitly granted, as long as the new printing was also offered free-of-charge. Although a relatively large edition for an early Brautigan work, it's one of the harder items to find. The eight poem titles and associated seed packets are as follows: \n*  California Native Flowers \n*  Calendula \n*  Carrots \n*  Lettuce \n*  Sweet Alyssum Royal Carpet \n*  Squash \n*  Shasta Daisy \n*  ParsleyThis project was re-created for the first time since 1970 and for the first time in the UK for the inaugural Dinefwr Literature Festival, June 2012, West Wales. saltpeter and the Brautigan Book Club is bringing a trilogy of Brautigan inspired events, one of which is Please Plant This Book, to celebrate the start of this festival, held in the countryside and on the grounds of historical Dinefwr Park and Castle. In addition to reprinting the poetry folders, a mini-album of musical responses will also be distributed for free, and the public will be taken on a walk through the grounds where a pomegranate tree, nicknamed \"the Brautigan pomegranate\", has been planted. Ianthe Brautigan, Brautigan's daughter, was present at the festival, having flown in from San Francisco to join in the celebrations. It is possible to obtain limited edition handmade copies of PPTB for free here. The only hope we have is our   children and the seeds we give them   and the gardens we plant together.\"Lettuce\" from Please Plant This Book (1968)"

  "text" : "Petals of Blood is a novel written by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and first published in 1977. Set in Kenya just after independence, the story follows four characters – Munira, Abdulla, Wanja, and Karega – whose lives are intertwined due to the Mau Mau rebellion. In order to escape city life, each retreats to the small, pastoral village of Ilmorog. As the novel progresses, the characters deal with the repercussions of the Mau Mau rebellion as well as with a new, rapidly westernizing Kenya. The novel largely deals with the scepticism of change after Kenya's liberation from the British Empire, questioning to what extent free Kenya merely emulates, and subsequently perpetuates, the oppression found during its time as a colony. Other themes include the challenging of capitalism, politics, and the effects of westernization. Education, schools, and the Mau Mau rebellion are also used to unite the characters, who share a common history with one another."

  "text" : "Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally \"love of wisdom\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, \"philosophy\" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, \"natural philosophy\" encompassed astronomy, medicine and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy? Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (\"concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being\"), epistemology (about the \"nature and grounds of knowledge [and]...its limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science and the history of Western philosophy. Since the 20th century professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors, researchers and writers. However, many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law, journalism, politics, religion, science, business and various art and entertainment activities."

  "text" : "Phoebe Daring: A Story for Young Folk is a mystery novel for juvenile readers, written by L. Frank Baum, the author of the Oz books. Published in 1912, it was a sequel to the previous year's The Daring Twins, and the second and final installment in a proposed series of similar books. Phoebe Daring was illustrated by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens, the artist who illustrated Baum's The Flying Girl, Annabel, and The Flying Girl and Her Chum in the same period. Hungry Tiger Press announced that they would reprint the book as Unjustly Accused! in the back of their 2006 reprint of the first book as The Secret of the Lost Fortune. Like The Daring Twins, Phoebe Daring involves two orphaned twins, Philip and Phoebe Daring; as its title indicates, the sister takes the primary role in the second book, which delivers a plot about a good man unjustly suspected of a crime – very much as the first one did. This similarity, and lack of originality, might be the best explanation for the book's limited popular success and the termination of the Daring Twins series after two books. It is clear that Baum had hopes of more Daring Twins novels, involving the younger of the five Daring siblings and eventually their children as well. Evidence suggests that he wrote at least a third book in the series; in the papers left after Baum's death in 1919, the file that contained the manuscript for his last Oz book, Glinda of Oz, was labelled Phoebe Daring, Conspirator. Baum's correspondence with his publisher, Reilly & Britton, mentions yet another book, titled either Phil Daring's Experiment or The Daring Twins' Experiment. Yet nothing of these other Daring books is known to have survived. The girl-detective concept had a persistent hold on Baum's imagination. He returned to it in a more successful series, the Mary Louise novels that he began in 1916."

  "text" : "Poltava (Полтава) is a narrative poem written by Aleksandr Pushkin in 1828-9 about the involvement of the Ukrainian Cossack hetman Ivan Mazepa in the 1709 Battle of Poltava between Sweden and Russia. The poem intertwines a love plot between Mazepa and Maria with an account of Mazepa's betrayal of Tsar Peter I and Peter's victory in battle. Although often considered one of Pushkin's lesser works and critiqued as unabashedly imperialistic, a number of critics have praised the poem for its depth of characterization and its ability to synthesize disparate genres. The poem inspired Tchaikovsky's 1884 opera Mazeppa."

  "text" : "Portobello is a novel by British writer Ruth Rendell, published in 2008. It is set in and around the Portobello Road in Notting Hill, London. Written in the third-person narrative mode, it follows the lives of a number of Londoners—rich and poor alike—living near the Portobello Road Market whose paths cross by accident rather than design. In other words, Portobello is about \"the destinies of an oddly assorted group of people, whose only common characteristic is their postcode.\" Throughout the novel, something menacing seems to lurk behind every street corner, and the suspicion that something awful or sinister is going to happen any minute \"(this is after all a novel by Ruth Rendell) is what hooks the reader\"  As \"one of the leading chroniclers of contemporary London\", Rendell has known the area and its inhabitants for so long that her \"take on Notting Hill restores some of the rawness taken away by gentrification and the saccharine stammer of the film of the same name.\""

The book is an expansion of a lecture given at the University of Athens in April 2007 under the title 'Lenin, Rawls and Political Philosophy'. The book has been regarded as a remarkable contribution to the social sciences due to its author's rejection of the popular politics as applied ethics approach in the current philosophical and political landscape. Professor Geuss argues that a dried and disembodied view of politics is the result of certain western philosophical traditions. Geuss points out that the recent and ongoing social conflicts call into question whether politics can be reduced to the realm of ethics without previously taking into account the needs, motivations and goals behind people's actions."

First published in 1971, it remains in print and is one of the most popular Dutch books for children, and the second most popular book by Schmidt (after Jip and Janneke). A radio drama based on the book was produced in 2002, and a movie in 2004; Tow Truck Pluck ranked No. 10 on the list of most popular Dutch movies between 1996 and 2005 and was awarded platinum status early in January 2005. The cover of Pluk (all drawings are by Schmidt's regular illustrator, Fiep Westendorp) is used to illustrate the article about Schmidt on the website of the \"Canon of the Netherlands,\" and Pluk got his own stamp in 1999."

Brought down to the smallest hamlets in the saddlebags of salesmen, it represents a phenomenal publishing success, despite its evil reputation -- or because of it. It is associated with a second work, the Grand Albert. It is a composite or heterogeneous work, and perhaps a bric-a-brac, collecting texts of unequal value written by (or attributed to) various authors; most of these authors are anonymous, but some are notable such as Cardano and Paracelsus. It's a relatively old text, although the attribution to Albertus Magnus is dubious, particularly as it quotes from so many later sources."

  "text" : "Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life is a 2005 popular science book by Nick Lane of University College London, which argues that mitochondria are central to questions of the evolution of multicellularity, the evolution of sexual reproduction, and to the process of senescence. Amongst the theories advanced in the book, Lane endorses the hydrogen hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell, whereby mitochondria are the original defining characteristic of the structure. He argues that the event was an exceedingly improbable one and questions the likelihood of it having happened elsewhere in the Universe. He also suggests that the necessity for genetic compatibility between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lies behind the differentiation of biological genders, ensuring that only one sexual partner contributes mitochondrial DNA to offspring. Steven Rose in The Guardian said that the book contains \"one of the most interesting stories modern biology has to tell\". It was shortlisted for the Royal Society Science Book Prize in 2006."

The novel mimic's this life with the fictional character, Olivier de Garmont, to the life of Tocqueville, to help the reader explore Tocqueville's life. The titular \"Parrot\" is Garmont's secretary, which New York Times reviewer Thomas Mallon describes as \"Dickensian\" character, and a guardian of Garmont as they explore the American environment. While Carey was developing the novel, an extract was published as: Carey, Peter (Autumn 2009). \"Parrot\". Granta (108): 245–284."

  "text" : "Patronage is a four volume fictional work by Anglo-Irish writer Maria Edgeworth and published in 1814. It is one of her later books, after such successes as Castle Rackrent (1800), Belinda (1801), Leonora (1806) and The Absentee in 1812, to name a few. The novel is a long and ambitious one which she began writing in 1809. It is the longest of her novels. Patronage as a book is path-making; it was among the first novels with a thesis and as such, it opened the way for Sir Walter Scott's historical novels. In the novel, Edgeworth focuses on and scrupulously explores the various types of patronage and the many forms it takes in all strata of English society. Despite the rigor of her analysis, Edgeworth obtains a sense of subtlety through her ingenious use of variations in characterizatons and a well diversified plot. The plot is made up of many incidents, great and small, that take the reader through a wide range of situations. Much like her contemporary, Jane Austen, Edgeworth had a gift for conveying social conventions through brilliant dialogue and acute moral observations. However, unlike Austen, Edgeworth's writing diverges into essay and an overemphasis on ideas (of which she has a large number) and veers once or twice into the didactic. The literary scholar Alastair Fowler notes her \"flawless ear for speech\" and ability to produce \"brilliant dialogue\", as well as the way her various subplots are linked by chains of causation that rest ultimately on a trivial plot element, much as Austen later was able to do so superbly. Edgeworth was eldest daughter of Richard Lovell Edgeworth, the Anglo-Irish politician, writer and inventor who had 21 other children with four wives. This book received the imprimatur of her famous father when published."

  "text" : "Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA is an autobiography written by former National Basketball Association (NBA) referee Tim Donaghy and published by Florida-based VTi-Group, Inc. in December, 2009. Donaghy, who had resigned from the league as a central figure in the 2007 NBA betting scandal, describes his involvement in and inner workings of the scandal, as well as his gambling addiction. Originally named Blowing the Whistle: The Culture of Fraud in the NBA, the book was canceled by publisher Triumph Books because of liability concerns. Pat Berdan, Donaghy's liaison with Triumph, said the book was canceled after the NBA threatened legal action—which the NBA denies. Donaghy eventually found a new publisher, VTi-Group, that was willing to release his book. It was subsequently renamed Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA and released in December 2009. \"We approached Mr. Donaghy after learning that his original publishing deal fell through. With a background in web media and traditional publishing, Mr. Donaghy felt that our firm was the best fit to become the publisher for this unique project.\" said Benjamin Daniel, a project manager at VTi. In the book, Donaghy describes his time as a referee in the CBA and NBA, discussing the NBA's inner workings, refereeing bias, TV media markets, owners in the NBA, marriage and divorce, NBA scandals, his time in jail, court process, solving the NBA's problems, referee personalities, and his life story."

  "text" : "Playing with Fire is the best selling autobiography of former National Hockey League (NHL) player Theoren Fleury. Co-written with author Kirstie McLellan Day, Fleury documented how he became a star player, Stanley Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist despite battling drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately ended his NHL career and led him to contemplate suicide. In the book, he made allegations that he was sexually abused by his junior coach, Graham James, and subsequently filed a complaint with Winnipeg Police Service. Graham James was prosecuted and was sentenced to jail time. Playing with Fire was a 2010 Libris Award nominee for top non-fiction book of 2010 by the Canadian Booksellers Association. In the weeks prior to the book's October 16, 2009 release, Fleury attempted to return to the NHL with the team he first played for, the Calgary Flames, six years after his last NHL game. Some observers praised him as a role model for his attempt, while others criticized it as being a publicity stunt to help generate interest in the book. He appeared in several exhibition games with the Flames, but was released and subsequently chose to retire from hockey. Riding a wave of popularity from his comeback attempt, Playing with Fire became the top-selling non-fiction book on Amazon.ca within two weeks of its release. Supported by an extensive promotional tour across Canada, Playing with Fire sold over 80,000 copies within six weeks of its release."

  "text" : "Prajapati(প্রজাপতি), a novel by Bengali author Samaresh Basu caused sensation with its publication. It was first published in 1967 (1374 Bengali Era) in the Sharodiyo Desh special (page no 174-226), a well known Bengali monthly magazine, a presentation of the Ananda Publishers. This novel is about a young boy who is used as the premises to understand not only his background but of the society at large. Samaresh Basu narrates the novel in first person and uses flashback technique to articulate and stir events of protagonist's life within a short time limit of 24 hours or a day. The methodology of the novel reminds one of the famous Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. It was a young lawyer named Amal Mitra who first filed a charge of obscenity against the author Samaresh Basu and the publisher Shitangsukumar Dasgupta on 2 February 1968 for the novel Prajaproti. Later the Government of West Bengal supported Amal Mitra and spoke against Prajapoti. The Lower Court gave the verdict that the book was indeed obscene and had no literary value whatsoever. The High Court went on to uphold the just mentioned verdict. After a long time of almost seventeen years, Prajapoti got rid of the stigma ‘banned’ after a verdict given by Supreme Court of India in its favour.Reportedly, Prajapati had been published by Ananda Publishers as a hard cover book before the charge of obscenity had been made against it. In its second edition in 1985 soon after the verdict had been overturned it made record sales. The 11th edition of Projapoti states that the first edition had printed 8800 copies but from the second through the tenth edition (from 1985–2003), the sales went up to 48,000 copies!"

The book is based upon a series of articles published in Research/Development Magazine in 1976 and 1977. It proposes 'Putt's Law' and 'Putt's Corollary' which are principles of negative selection similar to The Dilbert principle by Scott Adams proposed in the 1990s. Putt's law is sometimes grouped together with the Peter principle, Parkinson's Law and Stephen Potter's Gamesmanship series as \"P-literature\"."

  "text" : "Parallel Play is a memoir by Tim Page, originally issued, over the author's objections, as Parallel Play: Growing Up With Undiagnosed Asperger's. (The subtitle was dropped after the first edition.) Published in 2009 by Doubleday, Parallel Play describes Page's early life, growing up in Storrs, Connecticut, where he was regularly described as a genius and became known as a precocious filmmaker through the documentary A Day With Timmy Page. Yet he was personally remote, an underachiever in school and subject to depression and anxiety throughout his life. Eventually, he became a writer and critic and won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1997. Three years later, he was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, which Page describes as \"one of those rare clinical confirmations met mostly with relief\" as it explained many of the difficulties he had experienced growing up. In August 2007, a 5000-word article entitled Parallel Play was published in The New Yorker. The article was specifically about Page's Asperger Syndrome. The book is more general, covering Page's personal quirks, his drug-taking in youth, and a fatal accident in which he was a passenger. In his preface to the Anchor Books edition, Page disavowed the \"Undiagnosed Asperger's\" subtitle and described Parallel Play as a \"quirky memoir that could have been subtitled 'Old Records and Silent Movies', 'Eastern Connecticut in the 1960s', or, to borrow a line from the Three Stooges, 'Loco Boy Makes Good'.\""

It is often identified as pseudoscience. Parapsychology research is largely conducted by private institutions in several countries and funded through private donations,and the subject rarely appears in mainstream science journals. Most papers about parapsychology are published in a small number of niche journals.Parapsychology has been criticised for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research. It has been noted that most academics do not take the claims of parapsychology seriously."

  "text" : "Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally \"love of wisdom\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, \"philosophy\" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, \"natural philosophy\" encompassed astronomy, medicine and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy? Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (\"concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being\"), epistemology (about the \"nature and grounds of knowledge [and]...its limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science and the history of Western philosophy. Since the 20th century professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors, researchers and writers. However, many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law, journalism, politics, religion, science, business and various art and entertainment activities."

In his introduction, Marcus explains that, \"Perhaps what this book demands from a reader is a willingness to accept that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but record reviews.\" The book consists mainly of Bangs' published articles, beginning with his early work for Creem magazine before moving into his later writings as a freelancer for New Musical Express and other publications. Many of his most famous works are present, including the title piece on garage rock band the Count Five and the Troggs-inspired \"James Taylor Marked for Death\" from his earlier career as well as an acclaimed profile of the Clash and a tribute to Van Morrison's album Astral Weeks from his later years. One chapter of the book is devoted entirely to Bangs' infamous series of interviews with Lou Reed, including \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves,\" while another chapter features unpublished essays and an unfinished novel excerpt, \"Maggie May\"."

  "text" : "Playing Indian is a 1998 book by Philip J. Deloria. In it, Deloria discusses the way in which white American men have adopted Indian traditions, images, and clothing, citing examples like the Boston Tea Party, the Improved Order of Red Men, Tammany Hall, Scouting, hippies, and New Agers. Referring to D. H. Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature, Deloria argues that white Americans used the idea of the Indian to create their own national identity, both identifying with Indians as liberated New World inhabitants and opposing them as a savage other. \"Disguise readily calls the notion of fixed identity into question,\" writes Deloria. \"At the same time, however, wearing a mask also makes one self-conscious of a real 'me' underneath.\" The book is a reworking of Deloria's 1994 Yale doctoral dissertation. Deloria refers to David Roediger's The Wages of Whiteness, a similar book about the construction of the white race in opposition to black slaves; his book has itself been compared to scholarly work on blackface and to the work of Richard White."

The lectures were broadcast on CBC Radio One's Ideas, November 8–12. The book was published by House of Anansi Press. The plot follows four characters, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel, as they arrive in the lounge of an airport bar, as they interact with one another, and as they cope with chaos that erupts as cataclysmic events occur. The story addresses their motivations and perceptions, as well as their thoughts on certain themes. There are several minor characters and a fifth main character, Player One, who retells the events that the four main characters experience but from the perspective of an outside observer, like someone exploring a video game environment."

  "text" : "Patriotic Gore: Studies in the Literature of the American Civil War is a 1962 book of historical and literary criticism written by Edmund Wilson. It consists of 26 chapters about the works and lives of almost 30 writers, includingAmbrose Bierce,George Washington Cable‡,Mary Boykin Chesnut,Kate Chopin,John William De Forest‡ (who, as Henry Steele Commager puts it, \"surprisingly gets more space than any other writer, North or South\"),Charlotte Forten,Ulysses Grant‡, Francis Grierson‡,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Hinton Rowan Helper,Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.‡, Henry James,Sidney Lanier,Abraham Lincoln,John S. Mosby,Frederick Law Olmsted,Thomas Nelson Page,Harriet Beecher Stowe‡,Albion W. TourgéeJohn Townsend Trowbridge,Mark Twain, and Walt Whitman. In addition to De Forest, Wilson pays particular attention to Cable, Grant, Grierson, Holmes, and Stowe, choices considered \"catholic and unexpected\" at the time of its publication. The book's title is a reference—\"wrenched rather violently\" —from a line about the Baltimore riot of 1861 in \"Maryland, My Maryland.\" Its introduction has been called a \"mesmerizing if troubling manifesto\" written \"in the midst of various Cold War crises\"; the introduction is a \"blunt and sustained critique of the Cold War and of war itself\"; it has been called \"everything from shocking to naive to brilliant; some considered it unpatriotic, even un-American.\" Henry Steele Commager described the book as a \"series of reflections on [Civil War] literature and on the men and women, and the societies, that produced it\"; he characterized it as \"original, skeptical, allusive, penetrating. It is discursive, ranging widely from North to South, and even more widely in time.\""

In Packing for Mars, Roach searches for answers to questions about the gross, the bizarre, and the uncomfortable aspects of space travel. The book's 16 chapters cover the entire comedic spectrum of all things space-related, and also include some study of the scientific side of space travel. The chapters discussing the various bodily functions of astronauts in space (going to the bathroom, having sex, vomiting) and obscure testing procedures (animals in space, lying in beds for months, parabolic zero-g) are balanced by the informative sections on topics such as the psychological effects of being in space, astronaut training, and the increasing use of human cadavers over crash test dummies in research."

  "text" : "Passage to Nirvana, A Survivor's Zen Voyage: Reflections on Loss, Discovery, Healing & Hope is a memoir by Lee Carlson, written over a several year period from 2005-2010 primarily on board a 60-foot sailboat named Nirvana that he shared with his fiancée Meg. It was his first book, although he had made his living as a writer for most of his adult life, working first as a journalist, magazine editor and freelance writer, and then moving into advertising and marketing copywriting. The book centers around Carlson's Traumatic Brain Injury and subsequent recovery, as well as his mother's death from a Traumatic Brain Injury. However the book is much more far-ranging, delving into such subjects as Zen Buddhism, sailing, divorce, children, family and even poetry. Ultimately it is a book about finding peace and happiness after a traumatic life event, a book about finding the joy in living."

The novel chronicles the reactions of Carpious Mightson and his neighbors when registered sex offender, Ian Kaplan, moves into the family-friendly neighborhood, Mechi Lane. Carpious is an esteemed, charismatic leader in his community, but it is slowly revealed that there is a duality about him. He has a personal connection to Ian that he would prefer stays hidden. Bivins delves into societal perceptions of sex offenders versus violent offenders and how it seems commonplace and accepted that sex-offenders can't be rehabilitated. The overarching theme of the novel is forgiveness."

  "text" : "Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100 is a 2011 book by theoretical physicist Michio Kaku, author of Hyperspace and Physics of the Impossible. In it Kaku speculates about possible future technological development over the next 100 years. He interviews notable scientists about their fields of research and lays out his vision of coming developments in medicine, computing, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and energy production. The book was on the New York Times Bestseller List for five weeks. Kaku writes how he hopes his predictions for 2100 will be as successful as science fiction writer Jules Verne's 1863 novel Paris in the Twentieth Century. Kaku contrasts Verne's foresight against U.S. Postmaster General John Wanamaker, who in 1893 predicted that mail would still be delivered by stagecoach and horseback in 100 years' time, and IBM chairman Thomas J. Watson, who in 1943 is alleged to have said \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" Kaku points to this long history of failed predictions against progress to underscore his notion \"that it is very dangerous to bet against the future\"."

  "text" : "Passion is a 2011 young adult fantasy novel from the Fallen series written by Lauren Kate. Passion, the sequel to Torment, continues the story of Lucinda Price (Luce) who, at the end of the previous book, decides to find out more about her past lives by stepping through an Announcer, ignoring Daniel's plea to stop. Daniel, Luce's boyfriend and fallen angel, decides to follow her, promising to find and rescue her. Before Luce and Daniel met at Sword and Cross, before they fought the Immortals, they had already lived many lives. And so Luce, desperate to unlock the curse that condemns their love, must revisit her past incarnations in order to understand her fate. Each century, each life, holds a different clue. But Daniel is chasing her throughout the centuries before she has a chance to rewrite history."

  "text" : "Programming the Z80 is a seminal programming text, written by Rodnay Zaks and first published in 1979 by Sybex. It is designed as both an educational text to teach programming techniques of elementary to intermediate level using Assembly language, and as a self-contained reference book. Topics specific to the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, such as its internal hardware organisation and instruction set are described in detail. Additionally more general concepts, such as information representation and data structures are also covered. The book is considered an indispensable reference guide by many Z80 programmers. It was also published by Radio Shack with the title How To Program The Z80. A companion volume Z80 Applications written by James W. Coffron was published in 1983 by Sybex."

Pirates of the Caribbean is a Disney media franchise encompassing numerous theme park attractions, a series of films, and spin-off novels, as well as a number of related video games and other media publications. The franchise originated with the Pirates of the Caribbean theme ride attraction, which opened at Disneyland in 1967 and was one of the last Disney theme park attractions overseen by Walt Disney. Disney based the ride on pirate legends and folklore. As of October 2016, Pirates of the Caribbean attractions can be found at five Disney theme parks. Their related films have grossed over US$ 3.7 billion worldwide as of January 2015, putting the film franchise 10th in the list of all-time highest grossing franchises and film series."

  "text" : "Pedaling Revolution: How Cyclists Are Changing American Cities is a non-fiction book written by Jeff Mapes, a political reporter for The Oregonian. The book gives a brief history of the bicycle from its start in the early 1800s, when it could only be afforded by the wealthy, through to the present. He talks of the 1890s when bicycles were inexpensive enough for commoners to afford, yet automobiles had yet to be mass produced, and city streets were filled with bikes leading the League of American Wheelmen to lobby for paved roads. The end of World War II saw a decline in the bicycle as automobiles became more a way of life. The 1970s saw a boom in the American bicycle market, to again decline in the 1980s. Most recently, Mapes looked at several then-current politicians who were outspoken about bicycle advocacy such as then-chairman Jim Oberstar (D-MN) of the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who Mapes calls the highest regarded cycling supporter in Congress. Later chapters look at cycling in cities such as Amsterdam, Davis, California, Portland, Oregon, and New York City. The final chapters detail some of the risks and rewards of bicycling. The trade journal Library Journal highly recommends this book for all libraries. Cycling advocate John Allen argues that the book is most valuable for the attention to detail, saying \"the book will be a valuable resource... for historians some twenty or fifty years in the future\"."

Translated by Princess Galitzine for Chapmann & Hall, it came out in English in 1874. Prince Serebrenni (also known as The Silver Knight, according to the alternative translation), a novel about 16th-century Russia, inspired by the works of Sir Walter Scott and the German Romantics, has become a popular young adult novel in Russia. Acknowledging its limits as a historical document, critics invariably praised the way it \"imbued the readership with the ideas of justice, honesty, nobleness and human dignity.\""

Propaganda is information that is not impartial and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (perhaps lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented. Today the term propaganda is associated with a manipulative and jingoistic approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term."

  "text" : "Perfect English is the second blackly comic novel by British writer Paul Pickering. It is based on his own experience as an \"Internationalista\" in the war in Nicaragua against the Contras. The novel was long-listed for the Booker Prize and received very favourable reviews. Pickering was for a while under siege in the Nicaraguan town of Bluefields, where he helped former Baader-Meinhof printer, novelist and playwright, Peter-Paul Zahl, build a Bertolt Brecht youth theatre after his first was destroyed in the invasion of Grenada. A central concern of the novel is to illustrate how the best intentions can go horribly wrong."

  "text" : "Peace is an early novel by Gene Wolfe that on its surface is the story of a man growing up in a small Midwestern town in the early to mid-20th century.The narrator, Alden Dennis Weer, goes over memories from different parts of his life—his childhood, early adulthood, middle age, old age. Unlike many of Wolfe's most well-known works, it is a stand-alone novel rather than part of a series, and at least ostensibly takes place in a realistic, present-day world instead of a fantastic setting. As in many of Wolfe's novels, much of the novel is taken up with stories within stories—particularly stories told to Weer as a child. Many of the key events of the novel are not explicitly narrated, but can be inferred or guessed at based on information in the stories. Different critics interpret differently what is actually happening in the novel.One interpretation is that Weer is dead, and the scattered memories are those of a ghost; in 2014, Wolfe confirmed that this was his intention. Another interpretation is that the memories of his old age are the fantasies of a middle-aged Weer, who is experiencing a nervous breakdown. The novel includes subtle clues to guide the reader's understanding of the story, although the mysteries behind these clues have been hotly debated. Wolfe has described Peace as his favorite work, as it is the one where he came closest to achieving his original goals. Neil Gaiman, who has frequently praised the novel, said: \"Peace really was a gentle Midwestern memoir the first time I read it. It only became a horror novel on the second or the third reading.\""

  "text" : "Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion is a taxonomical study of various world religions which argues for a new definition of the word \"paganism\". It was written by the British religious studies scholar Michael York of Bath Spa University and first published by New York University Press in 2003. In Pagan Theology, York presents his controversial theory that the term \"paganism\", originally a pejorative term to refer to non-Christian religions, should instead be used by scholars to refer specifically to those religious movements who share the common characteristics of polytheism, animism and life-affirming beliefs. Under this category of \"paganism\", York therefore includes the extinct historical faiths of pre-Christian Europe, living indigenous religions, several modern religions like Shinto and Hinduism, and the new religious movements of contemporary Paganism. Furthermore, York argues that this \"paganism\" was the \"root religion\" of humanity, from which later monotheistic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam developed. Academic reviews of York's book were mixed, with reviewers making note of the ambitious nature of Pagan Theology, but some believing that it failed to present an entirely convincing argument. As a result of this, not all of them agreed with York's proposed categories, citing various reasons why they believed that it should not be employed. In the wider field of Pagan studies it has been criticised, most notably by Michael F. Strmiska, who argued that it contributed to the cultural oppression of indigenous peoples."

The book is the sixth novel by Miller and was released on 9 June 2011 in the United Kingdom through Sceptre, an imprint of Hodder & Stoughton. The novel is set in pre-revolutionary France and the upcoming turmoil is a consistent theme throughout. It follows an engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte and chronicles his efforts in clearing an overfilled graveyard which is polluting the surrounding area. Baratte makes friends and enemies as the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. Miller was inspired to write about the Les Innocents Cemetery after reading historian Philippe Ariès's brief description of its clearing and imagining the theatrics that must have been involved. The novel received positive reviews, particularly noting the quality of writing. The novel was awarded the Costa Book Award 2011 for \"Best Novel\" and \"Book of the Year\", and was nominated for the Walter Scott Prize and South Bank award."

  "text" : "Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (German: Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte) (1874; second edition 1924) is an 1874 book by the Austrian philosopher Franz Brentano, which established Brentano's reputation as a philosopher, helped to establish psychology as a scientific discipline, and influenced developments such as Husserlian phenomenology, analytic philosophy, gestalt psychology, and Alexius Meinong's theory of objects. It is Brentano's best known book and has been called his greatest work, and compared to Wilhelm Wundt's Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie and Sigmund Freud's Project for a Scientific Psychology. Brentano believed that the goal of psychology should be to establish exact laws. However, the results that Brentano produces from his method in Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint have been described as \"deadly dull and nearly vacuous.\""

  "text" : "Poison (2003) is a young-adult English-language fantasy novel written by Chris Wooding, published in 2003. It is a highly metafictional novel which follows the adventures of a young (sixteen-year-old) female protagonist named Poison as she attempts to rescue her sister from the Phaerie Realm. It contains many intertextual references particularly to mythology, fairy tales and secondary world fantasy (i.e. a story about a world in which magic works without any connection to the \"real\" world) characteristics. Wooding credits his travels through Europe as the inspiration for Poison, which he began writing a year after returning home. He says of the novel: \"It can be read one level as a weird, gruesome kind of fairy tale, but there's a lot more to it than that. I spent most of my time writing this novel worrying about whether anyone would 'get' it, or whether it would sound like some degenerate A-Level student's philosophical rant when it was all finished instead of the story it was supposed to be, but I think it all worked out fine in the end. I'm very happy with it, anyways. And at least I got to put all the folklore I studied at University to good use.\""

  "text" : "Paradise Lust: Searching for the Garden of Eden is a 2011 book by Brook Wilensky-Lanford that discusses efforts to locate the Garden of Eden. Wilensky-Lanford writes that more people began to search for the garden to reassert the truth of the Bible after the advent of Darwinism. The book focuses on 20th-century individuals who have sought to locate the garden. Wilensky-Lanford profiles several individuals who have discussed the location of the garden, including William Fairfield Warren and the author(s) of The Urantia Book. Paradise Lust also discusses the work of archaeologist Juris Zarins. Associated Press writer Carl Hartman applauded the book as \"witty and exhaustively researched\", though he notes that the title could confuse readers. (Wilensky-Lanford chose the book's title as a reference to Paradise Lost by John Milton, not to indicate sexual content.) Writing in The New York Times, Andrea Wulf praised the book as an \"enjoyable parade of oddities\" that is an \"appealing mix of serious research and tongue-in-cheek humor\", but noted that it occasionally felt like a repetitive list of bizarre characters."

  "text" : "Psyche (German: Psyche, zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Seele) is an 1846 book by Carl Gustav Carus, a physician and painter noted for his work on animal psychology and physiognomy. In his The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970), Henri Ellenberger calls Psyche \"the life-work of a physician and keen observer of the human mind\" and \"the first attempt to give a complete and objective theory on unconscious psychological life\", adding that \"It shows the shape reached by the theory of the unconscious at the end of the Romantic period, before the positivistic trend became dominant.\" He notes that Carus influenced Eduard von Hartmann and later Carl Jung. According to him, Carus defines psychology as \"the science of the soul's development from the unconscious to the conscious\" and believes that \"human life is divided into three periods: (1) A pre-embryonic period in which the individual merely exists as a tiny cell within the mother's ovary. (2) the embryonic period; through fecundation, in which the individual is suddenly wakened from his long sleep, and the formative unconscious develops. (3) After birth, in which the formative unconscious continues to direct the individual's growth and the function of his organs. Consciousness arises gradually, but it always remains under the influence of the unconscious and the individual periodically returns to it in his sleep.\" Carus distinguishes between three layers of the unconscious: \"(1) The general absolute unconscious, which is totally and permanently inaccessible to our consciousness. (2) The partial absolute unconscious to which belong the processes of formation, growth, and activity of the organs. This part of the unconscious exerts an indirect influence on our emotional life. Carus describes the 'districts of the soul' such as respiration, blood circulation, liver activity; each of these districts has an emotional tonality of its own and contributes to the constitution of the vital feeling underlying emotional life. Conscious thoughts and feelings also exert a slow and mediate action on the partial absolute unconscious; this explains why a person's physiognomy can reflect his conscious personality. (3) The relative or secondary unconscious comprehending the totality of feelings, perceptions, and representations, which were ours at one time or other and which have become unconscious.\" Carus ascribes the following characteristics to the unconscious: \"(1) The unconscious has 'prometheic' and 'epimetheic' aspects, it is turned toward the future and toward the past but does not know of the present. (2) The unconscious is in constant movement and transformation; conscious thoughts or feelings, when becoming unconscious, undergo continuous modification and maturation. (3) The unconscious is indefatigable; it does not need periodic rest, whereas our conscious life needs rest and mental restoration which it finds by plunging into the unconscious. (4) The unconscious is basically sound and does not know disease; one of its functions is 'the healing power of Nature.' (5) The unconscious works along its own ineluctable laws and has no freedom. (6) The unconscious possesses its own inborn wisdom; in it, there is no trial and error, no learning. (7) Without being consciously aware of it, we remain in connection through the unconscious with the rest of the world, particularly with our fellow-beings.\" Lancelot Law Whyte calls Psyche \"a great work\" and \"a landmark\". He comments that while Carus, whose \"penetrating interpretation of the unconscious mind was prejudiced by a somewhat sentimental idealistic and religious optimism\", neglected the conflicts that were Sigmund Freud's main concern, he had \"a vivid sense of the importance of the sexual functions, unconscious as instinct and conscious as voluptuousness, in relation to the mind as a whole.\""

It is a rhythmical story of Australia's varied landscapes and the animals in them. Fox wrote her first draft for Possum Magic in 1978, during a course in children’s literature at Flinders University. Over five years, nine publishers rejected the draft. When it was accepted by Omnibus Books in Adelaide they asked Fox to reduce the four-and-a-half page book, then titled Hush the Invisible Mouse, by two-thirds and to change the mice to Australian animals to place emphasis on her Australian theme. As of 2011, Possum Magic sold three million copies."

  "text" : "Plus is Joseph McElroy's fifth novel. Set in some unspecified future, it tells the story of Imp Plus, a disembodied brain controlling IMP, the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform, in earth orbit. The novel consists of Imp Plus's thoughts as he tries to comprehend his limited existence, while struggling with language, limited memories, and communicating with Ground Control. The plot, such as it is, is driven in slow motion by Imp Plus's recall of fragments of his past and of language, his improving comprehension of his present, all while his medical condition gradually deteriorates. McElroy denies that the novel is science fiction, unless \"science\" is used in its etymological sense of \"knowing\". The novel was reprinted as an e-book by Dzanc Books in 2014, with an introductory 2012 poem \"A Green of its Own Breathing\" by Sarah Grindley, dedicated to \"Joe McElroy & Imp Plus\"."

  "text" : "Poor Folk (Russian: Бедные люди, Bednye lyudi), sometimes translated as Poor People, is the first novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, written over the span of nine months between 1844 and 1845. Dostoyevsky was in financial difficulty because of his extravagant living and his developing gambling addiction; although he had produced some translations of foreign novels, they had little success, and he decided to write a novel of his own to try to raise funds. Inspired by the works of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written in the form of letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who are poor second cousins. The novel showcases the life of poor people, their relationship with rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of literary naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. Devushkin, a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time, retains his sentimental characteristics; Dobroselova abandons art, while Devushkin cannot live without literature. Contemporary critics lauded Poor Folk for its humanitarian themes. While Vissarion Belinsky dubbed the novel Russia's first \"social novel\" and Alexander Herzen called it a major socialist work, other critics detected parody and satire. The novel uses a complicated polyphony of voices from different perspectives and narrators. Initially offered by Dostoyevsky to the liberal-leaning magazine Fatherland Notes, the novel was published in the almanac, St. Petersburg Collection, on January 15, 1846. It became a huge success nationwide. Parts of it were translated into German by Wilhelm Wolfsohn and published in an 1846/1847 magazine. The first English translation was provided by Lena Milman in 1894, with an introduction by George Moore, cover art design by Aubrey Beardsley and publication by London's Mathews and Lane."

  "text" : "(\"Sexually explicit\" redirects here. For non-pornographic sexually explicit media, see erotica.) Pornography (often abbreviated as \"porn\" or \"porno\" in informal usage) is the portrayal of sexual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcards, photographs, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, film, video, and video games. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors or porn stars, who perform in pornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in a porn film may also be called a model. Various groups within society have considered depictions of a sexual nature immoral, addictive, and noxious, labeling them pornographic, and attempting to have them suppressed under obscenity and other laws, with varying degrees of success. Such works have also often been subject to censorship and other legal restraints to publication, display, or possession. Such grounds, and even the definition of pornography, have differed in various historical, cultural, and national contexts. Social attitudes towards the discussion and presentation of sexuality have become more tolerant and legal definitions of obscenity have become more limited, notably beginning in 1969 with Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States, and the subsequent Golden Age of Porn, leading to an industry for the production and consumption of pornography in the latter half of the 20th century. The introduction of home video and the Internet saw a boom in the worldwide porn industry that generates billions of dollars annually. Commercialized pornography accounts for over US$2.5 billion in the United States alone, including the production of various media and associated products and services. This industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. More recently, sites such as Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn have served as repositories for home-made or semi-professional pornography, made available free by its creators (who could be called exhibitionists). It has presented a significant challenge to the commercial pornographic film industry. Irrespective of the legal or social view of pornography, it has been used in a number of contexts. It is used, for example, at fertility clinics to stimulate sperm donors. Some couples use pornography at times for variety and to create a sexual interest or as part of foreplay. There is also some evidence that pornography can be used to treat voyeurism."

It occupies about 300 printed book pages. Its authorship is attributed to Geoffrey the Grammarian, a friar who lived in Lynn, Norfolk, England. After the invention of the printing press the Promptorium was published repeatedly in the early 16th century by the printer Wynkyn de Worde. In the 19th century the Camden Society republished it under the extended title Promptorium parvulorum sive clericorum (“Storehouse for children or clerics”). For language historians it is a major reference work for the vocabulary of late medieval English. It is a frequently cited reference in today's primary dictionary of late medieval English, the Middle English Dictionary."

Hemenway makes the central case that \"more guns in a community lead to more homicide\". He published the book through the University of Michigan Press in 2004."

  "text" : "Phaladeepika is a treatise on Hindu astrology written by Mantreswara. The text is written in lyrical Sanskrit verse comprises 865 slokas and 28 chapters. It is one of the more significant works on Hindu astrology, along with Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra of Parashara, Brihat Jataka of Varahamihira, and Jataka Parijata of Vaidyanatha Dikshita. It deals in a most comprehensive and authoritative manner with almost all astrological aspects of human life. Mantreswara has equated a retrograde planet with an exalted planet in strength and effects even though it be in an inimical or its debilitation sign differing with Saravali which states that benefics are powerful when retrograde and cause Raja yoga (Hindu astrology) but malefic when retrograde do not confer favourable results. Very little is known about its author, Mantreswara, who is believed to have lived in the 13th century CE. He was born Markandeya Bhattathiri in a family of Namboodari Brahmins in Panchgiri village of Tirunelveli in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He was a devotee of Sukuntlambika Devi and was well-versed in many branches of knowledge; he had traveled to far-off places in India in search of knowledge. He had renounced the world and had finally died in Tirunelveli; his date of birth and his date of death are not known. According to one belief Mantreswara was born in Shalivati in Tamil Nadu and according to another, he was born in Kerala. Whether he lived in the 13th century or in the 16th century remains undecided. His work, Phaladeepika, though very popular in South India and from a very long time in the past available in Southern languages script-versions came to light when its original Sanskrit version was published from Kolkata around 1925. At the very close of this text, Mantreswara confirms that श्रीशालिवाटिजातेन मया मन्त्रेश्वरेण वै |दैवज्ञेन द्विजाग्रेण सतां ज्योतिर्विदां मुदे || - Sloka XXVIII.5 he indeed lived in Shalivati, in present Tirunelveli, as a renowned Brahmin astrologer."

The author himself wrote a brief commentary to his book with the name 'Durgamartha prakasini'. This work is known in English through the commentary written by Punnasseri Nambi Neelakantha Sarma, a disciple of Kerala Varma. All Parashari principles are briefly available in this classic, and  about which principles it is claimed that one conversant with the six branches of Jyotisa will never err in predictions. Prasna Marga is the most comprehensive and elaborate exposition of Horary astrology. This classic occupies a high position of pride without entering into which like mines of works riches of Indian astrology cannot be discovered. In Prasna Marga each house is allotted a fixed number of Sarvashtaka bindus above which the house prospers (this concept is taken from Ashtakavarga chapter of BPHS or Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, the foundational classic of Indian predictive astrology)). Prasna Marga also uses many techniques, like Navams-Navams, Navams-Dvadasams, etc. which are not used by anyone in practice, but were used earlier."

  "text" : "Prasna Tantra is a famous work of Neelakantha on Horary astrology. Neelakantha Daivagnya, the author of Tajika Neelakanthi was the minister and court astrologer of Mughal Emperor Jalaluddin Akbar. Prasna Tantra is based on the Tajika system of prognostication. It comprises 430 slokas divided into four chapters, and is written in the usual Sanskrit Sloka – format. It is believed that this work, which is compact and comprehensive, proven and applicable to modern conditions, is the Third Tantra or division of Neelakantha’s larger work, Tajika Neelakanthi. Prasna Tantra is divided into four chapters, viz – Prasna Vichara (preliminaries), Bhava Prasna (questions bearing on different houses), Vishesha Prasna (special questions) and Prakirnakadhyaya (concluding remarks). The aspects considered by this work are those of the Tajika system, an aspect by itself has no orb but planets have orbs of operation; Yogas in this system arise on the basis of applying and separating aspects, the closer the yoga (Ithsala etc.,), the more certain will be the results. The rules and methods initiated by this text have found favour with astrologers since the time it was written and came to light around 1580 A.D.  Prasna Tantra by Neelakantha and Daivagya Vallabha of Varahamihira are a must to cover Prasna or Horary astrology."

Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. The territory that now constitutes Pakistan is considered a cradle of civilization which was previously home to several ancient cultures, including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Indian Mauryan Empire, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British Empire. Pakistan is unique among Muslim countries as it is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam. As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent's struggle for independence, Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for Muslims from the regions in the east and west of the Subcontinent where there was a Muslim majority. Initially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. A civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh. Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of four provinces and four federal territories. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with a similar variation in its geography and wildlife. A regional and middle power, Pakistan has the seventh largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state, being the only nation in the Muslim world, and the second in South Asia, to have that status. It has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector, its economy is the 26th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and 45th largest in terms of nominal GDP and is also characterized among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world. The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule, political instability and conflicts with neighbouring India. The country continues to face challenging problems, including overpopulation, terrorism, poverty, illiteracy, and corruption. Despite these factors it maintains strategic endowments and development potential while it has made substantial progress in reducing poverty giving it the second lowest headcount poverty rate in South Asia. The nation has recently witnessed a rapid expansion of its prosperous middle class, the 18th largest worldwide. Pakistan's stock exchange is Asia's highest performing stock market and, as of 2016, is part of the MSCI's emerging markets index. It is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Next Eleven Economies, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, ECO, UfC, D8, Cairns Group, Kyoto Protocol, ICCPR, RCD, UNCHR, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Group of Eleven, CPFTA, Group of 24, the G20 developing nations, ECOSOC, founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, SAARC and CERN."

  "text" : "Piter (Russian: Питер) is a novel written by Russian author Shimun Vrochek. Piter is part of Universe of Metro 2033, a long-running series of post-apocalyptic short stories, novellas, and novels, spanning a variety of genres. The works are written by several different authors. Piter was originally published in February 2010. Although there is currently no English version of the book, Piter has been translated into a number of other European languages, such as German, Polish and Spanish. The novel was translated to Polish by Paweł Podmiotko. The book itself is different from Dmitry Glukhovsky's original works, giving the reader a look at what happened after the Catastrophe in another part of Russia, whilst maintaining the original ideas and atmosphere behind Metro 2033. It is one of the longer novels in the Universe series. Piter is featured as an Easter egg in the video game adaptation of Metro 2033, where a 3D model of the book can be found laying on the rail cart near the end of the level Armory, during chapter 3 of the game's story."

  "text" : "Peeled and Quartered is a sixty-two page novella by Jessica I. Rowe, published in 2012. In it she creates a disturbing form of science fiction melded with certain dark elements that she terms \"disturbanization\". While there are aspects of science fiction infused into the writing, the dark and twisted turns of the plot coupled with the grimmer side of urban life (drugs, the homeless culture, mental illness) create this aspect of \"disturbanization\". The novella has been compared to the fusion of James's giant peach, and Burgess's madness in A Clockwork Orange. In this work, the drug and homeless cultures are represented along with a maniacal control freak from an alien planet who tortures and harangues the main character. Of significant importance to the element of \"disturbanization\" is the use of Bakhtin's \"chronotopic narrative\" with an emphasis on spatial and temporal movement. Aspects of Spinoza's concept of affect also present themselves to some degree."

  "text" : "Pak Lat Chronicles is a Mon language chronicle. It is so called because it was first published in Pak Lat, near Bangkok in Siam in two volumes. The provenance and chronology of the manuscripts of these two volumes are uncertain, and as of 2005, had not been analyzed in depth by a Burma Mon scholar. Scholarship, mainly by British colonial period historians, finds internal inconsistencies, and suggests the chronicles, judging by their vocabulary usage, were written in the late 19th century, probably after 1874. However, W.G. Cooper says the words could have been miscopied, and the original manuscripts might have been written much earlier as claimed. It is a subject, Michael Aung-Thwin writes, that \"needs a competent Burma Mon scholar to untangle properly.\" Despite its problems, the chronicles have been referenced by later historians such as G.E. Harvey and Nai Pan Hla. Pan Hla wrote his version of Razadarit Ayedawbon by incorporating details from Pak Lat. According to Aung-Thwin, it is also first Mon-language chronicle to mention King Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton, a topic that all previous Mon language chronicles never once mentioned. He suggests that the British historians' narratives and interpretations were incorporated into the leitmotif of this supposedly ancient text."

  "text" : "Passionate Journey, or My Book of Hours (French: Mon livre d'heures), is a wordless novel of 1919 by Flemish artist Frans Masereel. The story is told in 167 captionless prints, and is the longest and best-selling of the wordless novels Masereel made. It tells of the experiences of an early 20th-century everyman in a modern city. Masereel's medium is the woodcut, and the images are in an emotional, allegorical style inspired by Expressionism. The book followed Masereel's first wordless novel, 25 Images of a Man's Passion (1918); both were published in Switzerland, where Masereel spent much of World War I. German publisher Kurt Wolff released an inexpensive \"people's edition\" of the book in Germany with an introduction by German novelist Thomas Mann, and the book went on to sell over 100,000 copies in Europe. Its success encouraged other publishers to print wordless novels, and the genre flourished in the interwar years. Masereel followed the book with dozens of others, beginning with The Sun later in 1919. Masereel's work was lauded in the art world in the earlier half of the 20th century, but has since been neglected outside of Western comics circles, where Masereel's wordless novels are seen as anticipating the development of the graphic novel."

  "text" : "Perfect Chemistry is the first novel in the trilogy written by author Simone Elkeles and published by Walker Books for Young Readers in 2009 and also made it on the New York Times Best Sellers List. Perfect Chemistry is a part of the Young Adult genre because of the steamy high school romance Elkeles portrays in the novel. The main characters of the story Brittany Ellis, a white uptown teenager, and Alejandro \"Alex\" Fuentes, a lower class teenager of Mexican heritage must overcome Brittany's troubled home life and Alex's gang ties to have a their own happily ever after. The book was read and reviewed worldwide, but most popular in North Korea. Simone Elkeles has revealed in many interviews that she admits to writing Young Adult fiction Romance novels and with the Perfect Chemistry series she had to do numerous amounts of research to understand the cultural background of Alex's Mexican heritage. The book was followed by two sequels centered on the following Fuentes brothers, Carlos and Luis. Elkeles takes you into the streets of Chicago where love must overcome all for two teenagers to be together. They must triumph over gang fights, the mystery surrounding the Fuentes' murder of their father and the world's outlook on their relationship. The author has stated that she would like to continue writing books in the Perfect Chemistry series."

  "text" : "In literature the term generally refers to a character established by an author, one in whose voice all or part of a narrative takes place. Poets such as Robert Browning, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot are strongly associated with such narrative voices, as is the writer Luigi Pirandello. These writers understood the term slightly differently and derived its use and meaning from different traditions. Examples of Eliot's personae were Prufrock and Sweeney. Pound developed such characters as Cino, Bertran de Born, Propertius, and  Mauberley in response to figures in Browning’s dramatic monologues. Whereas Eliot used \"masks\" to distance himself from aspects of modern life which he found degrading and repulsive, Pound's personae were often poets and could be considered in good part alter-egos. For Pound, the personae were a way of working through a specific poetic problem. In this sense, the persona is a transparent mask, wearing the traits of two poets and responding to two situations, old and new, which are similar and overlapping. In literary analysis, any narrative voice that speaks in the first person and appears to define a particular character is often referred to as a persona. It is contrasted with a third-person narrative voice, generally taken to be more objective and impersonal. There are borderline cases, such as the “we” that occurs late in Edwin Arlington Robinson’s poem “Eros Turannos” and functions something like a chorus in a Greek tragedy, but in general any identifiable narrator whose point of view or manner of speaking clearly distinguishes him or her from the author is considered a literary persona."

  "text" : "Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore is a book on Abanindranath Tagore's paintings by art historianR. Siva Kumar. It is widely considered as a landmark book in the Indian art scene that brings together a large corpus of Abanindranath's work for the first time. It fulfils a glaring lacuna in the picture of this master of modern Indian art. In the books R. Siva Kumar states, 'The social space that Abanindranath narrativized as an artist-flaneur is thus the subject of the Orientalist artist/writer read from the obverse. He reclaims the colonial subjects' right to narrate their stories that was arrogated to themselves by the colonial rulers and perpetuated by presenting their readings as 'objective'. Abanindranath reasserts this right by recasting the Nights (Arabian Nights), a text central to the Orientalist representation of the East, by urging us to read his act of imagination contrapuntally with the text authenticated by the Orientalist.' Abanindranath Tagore (1871–1951) is a singular figure in Modern Indian Art. Having arrived on the Indian art scene with the first wave of nationalism, he was seen as father figure of nationalist art and modernism. Along with E B Havell, Coomaraswamy, Sister Nivedita and other nationalists he brought an attitudinal change in the Indian response to traditional art. But his true contribution went beyond these. Trained under European artists initially, realism remained the underpinning of his work. But as a modernist at heart who was guided more by his sensibility than his training, he transformed the post Renaissance academic realism into which he was trained with his series of contacts with oriental art into something more supple and responsive to the imaginative flights of his mind. A post-Romantic in his sensibilities, he let his individualism triumph over his nationalism. Although he aligned with the nationalists in the early years of his career he transcended it very soon to develop something more akin to a Baudelairian aesthetics of modernism with a subjective response to the world rather than an unmediated representation of things. His most impressive work, the Arabian Nights series painted in 1930, can be described as a look at his immediate world through the eyes of a Baudelarian Flaneur, with the stories of the Arabian Nights serving as a pre-text. Equally original as a writer, Abanindranath is a phenomenon whose import has not been fully grasped. Much of this has been due to the unfamiliarity with his work in the absence of easily accessible public collections and publications. The present book brings together a large body of his work for the first time in an attempt to fulfill a glaring lacuna in our picture of this early master of modern Indian art. The book has also influenced other books and researches on Abanindranatha Tagore. Ananya Vajpeyi in her Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India highlights the contribution of R. Siva Kumar's Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore in foregrounding Abanindranath Tagore's art anew."

  "text" : "Propinquity is a 1986 novel by the Australian author/journalist John Macgregor. The manuscript won the Adelaide Festival Biennial Award for Literature; the novel was short-listed for The Age Book of the Year. Its author was compared by critics with PG Wodehouse, Don DeLillo, Julian Barnes, Umberto Eco and Australian Nobellist Patrick White. Despite its critical success, the collapse of the original publisher meant that Propinquity did not reach a wide audience, although in 2013 it was released on Amazon as a Kindle e-book and a CreateSpace print-on-demand paperback. 'Propinquity charts a project by a group of Oxford medical undergraduates to bring a medieval English queen - buried deep under Westminster Abbey - back to life. In reviving her, the students intend to expose a 2,000-year-old conspiracy by the Church to repress gnosis - the experiential core of spiritual teaching - to maintain its political power. The attempt is led by a male Oxford medical student and the daughter of the Dean of Westminster, a medieval scholar, who had seen her father visit the secret tomb as a child, and later recalled the memories."

  "text" : "Pravasam is a 2008 Malayalam novel written by M. Mukundan. According to the author, the novel is an attempt to re-define nostalgia which is thought to be the essence of life of non-resident Malayalis and to pay respect to hundreds of thousands of Malayalis living as non-resident Keralites in different parts of the world. It is a novel that travels through generations. It depicts a clear picture of the life stories of various persons living in various parts of the world as non-resident keralites. It explains us about the different kinds of feelings of various kinds of people who had left their homeland for various reasons. These reasons include the emigration for the sake of seeking a better profession, for studies, for getting a better class of living and so on. But almost all of them dreams of returning to their homeland one day and enjoying the homeliness. One of the issues the books addresses is the question of cultural identity of the Malayali. A notable fact about the novel is that renowned Malayalam author S. K. Pottekkatt is a major character in the narrative. In the beginning, the narration is given such that, story is told by Pottekkatt and after his death, it was completed by Mukundan. Even, the narrator, himself is a non-resident keralite and has a lot of experiences to share with the readers. Whatever amenities the emigration life had provided them, each one of them, deep in their mind had a strong desire to come back to their native land one day. This uncontrolled emotions and sentiments of malayalis towards their homeland is clearly illustrated in the story. The novel was officially released on 23 August 2008 by former Kerala minister Binoy Viswam during the 6th World Malayali Conference held in Singapore. A formal release function was also held at Kerala on 18 September 2008. Former minister M. A. Baby handed over the first copy of the book to Sukumar Azhikode. M. Mukundan won the Habeeb Valappad Award in 2009 for this novel. Also, the 2009 Mudranamikavu Awards for Excellence in Book Production, instituted by the Department of Printing and Publishing of Mahatma Gandhi University, was awarded to DC Books for the printing and production of Pravasam."

The symbol-rich story tells of a sculptor who, in his quest for ideal beauty, neglects the reality of the struggles of his neighbors in the depths of the Great Depression. The engravings are done in a softer Art Deco style in contrast to the German Expressionism-influenced artwork of Ward's earlier works."

The book details their early lives, their humanitarian work in Afghanistan, and their three months of imprisonment by the Taliban in 2001. Born to middle-class American families, Curry and Mercer met at Antioch Community Church in Waco, Texas. They volunteered to work as aid workers with Shelter Now International (SNI) in Afghanistan in 2001, having been motivated by a desire to serve \"the poorest of the poor\". While there, they provided humanitarian aid to hospitals, street children, and impoverished communities in Kabul. Curry and Mercer were arrested by the Taliban on August 3 for evangelizing to a local family and imprisoned for over 100 days along with several other foreign volunteers. During their internment, they were threatened with execution and a number of inmates developed physical maladies, including head lice, asthma, and intestinal worms. Though the experience was \"devastatingly hard\", they wrote songs of praise and attempted to encourage the other prisoners. All of the SNI members were eventually freed by United States forces during operations in Kabul following the September 11 attacks of 2001. Curry and Mercer jointly wrote their memoir in the year following their rescue. It was released in the summer of 2002 and received favorable reviews from critics."

The work was prepared and written with careful attention to sampling, methodology and date interpretation, to demonstrate the Institute for Sex Research's scientific competence despite the death of Alfred Kinsey and to answer the criticism that the Institute was interested only in popular, moneymaking books. Though it did not receive the public acceptance of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, the work was well received in scientific circles, and demonstrated that the Institute could survive as a productive research organization."

  "text" : "Peaceful War: How the Chinese Dream and the American Destiny Create a Pacific New World Order is a book written by Patrick Mendis. It provides an epic analysis of the unfolding drama between the clashing forces of the Chinese dream and the American Dream. The foreword to the book is written by Jack Goldstone, the Virginia and John Hazel Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University. In 2012, Professor Mendis coined the new term \"Pacific Dream\" to describe possible outcomes resulting from the interface between the Sino-American policies and initiatives of President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping that resonate with the American Dream and the Chinese dream. In April 2013, US Secretary of State John Kerry officially unveiled President Obama's vision of the \"Pacific Dream\" to deliver mutual benefits among all stakeholders in the region. The themes of Mendis' book are seemingly drawn from ideas expressed during his extensive study and lecture tours in 2012 and 2013 at prestigious universities and institutions in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and elsewhere in Asia and America. These include the lectures at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing and the Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. His other related publications appeared in the Yale Journal of International Affairs, the Columbia University's Journal of International Affairs, the Minnesota Post, as well as the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong."

  "text" : "The Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI) is a self-test psychological personality inventory based in psychologist Carl Gustav Jung's notions of personality types and archetypes with heavy influences from the works of mythology scholar Joseph Campbell, such as his description of the archetypal monomyth in his seminal work The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949). Designed by Carol Pearson and Hugh Marr and published by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type (CAPT), the PMAI is derivative of the popular Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI, also published by CAPT) with the incorporation of twelve core personality archetypes which may be active in a person's psyche at any given moment in their life. The PMAI differs significantly from the MBTI and other type inventories in that the archetypes a person experiences as \"active\" in her or his life are dynamic and change over time. Though not currently administered as widely as the MBTI and its variants, the PMAI is increasingly being used for therapeutic, personal-growth, team-building, and educational applications. Described by Pearson and Marr as a \"well-person instrument\", the PMAI is not intended for diagnosis of mental illness, but rather as a method for developing awareness of archetypes and an appreciation of the gifts of all archetypes in order to assist with personal growth and group psychological health."

Pink carries him back to his Georgia home where he and his family were slaves. While the frightened soldier is nursed back to health under the care of Pink’s mother, Moe Moe Bay, he begins to understand why his newfound friend is so adamant on returning to the war; to fight against the sickness that is slavery."

  "text" : "The Promised Land (Hebrew: הארץ המובטחת‎‎, translit.: Ha'Aretz HaMuvtahat; Arabic: أرض الميعاد‎‎, translit.: Ard Al-Mi'ad; also known as \"The Land of Milk and Honey\") is the land which, according to the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible), was promised and subsequently given by God to Abraham and his descendants, and in modern contexts an image and idea related both to the restored Homeland for the Jewish people and to salvation and liberation is more generally understood. The promise was first made to Abraham (Genesis 15:18-21), then confirmed to his son Isaac (Genesis 26:3), and then to Isaac's son Jacob (Genesis 28:13), Abraham's grandson. The promised land was described in terms of the territory from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates river (Exodus 23:31). A smaller area of former Canaanite land and land east of the Jordan River was conquered and occupied by their descendants, the Israelites, after Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt (Numbers 34:1-12), and this occupation was interpreted as God's fulfilment of the promise (Deuteronomy 1:8). Moses anticipated that God might subsequently give the Israelites land reflecting the boundaries of God's original promise, if they were obedient to the covenant (Deuteronomy 19:8-9). The concept of the Promised Land is the central tenet of Zionism, whose discourse suggests that modern Jews descend from the Israelites and Maccabees through whom they inherit the right to re-establish their \"national homeland\". Palestinians also claim partial descent from the Israelites and Maccabees, as well as all the other peoples who have lived in the region. The imagery of the \"Promised Land\" was invoked in Negro spirituals as heaven or paradise and as an escape from slavery, often which can only be reached by death. The imagery and term have also been used in popular culture (see Promised Land (disambiguation)), sermons and in speeches, such as the \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" (1968) speech by Martin Luther King, Jr: I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."

Published 13 February 2014 by Doubleday Children's, the book includes a new story by Wilson, Leonie's Pet Cat, as well as extracts from such classics as The Hundred and One Dalmatians, by Dodie Smith, and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. Also called Battersea Cats and Dogs Anthology before publication, the book is under licence from \"Battersea Dogs' Home Ltd.\", with royalties from book sales going to support the registered charity. Although dogs appear before cats in the name of this animal welfare organisation, the anthology has the section with excerpts from Cat Stories first, and Dog Stories last, with the special Pets' Corner section in the middle, featuring new stories by notable children's authors about their pets. The cover art includes illustrations of pets. \"That's  on the cover, in the bottom right hand corner\", said Francesca Simon, who wrote the story about her Tibetan Spaniel."

  "text" : "Prince Lestat is the eleventh novel in The Vampire Chronicles series by Anne Rice, published on October 28, 2014. Rice had originally stated the novel Blood Canticle was meant to conclude the series, but in March 2014 she had announced a forthcoming novel that would be a sequel to the first five books and the start of a new series. She also announced via her personal Facebook that she had begun writing a follow-up novel to Prince Lestat, tentatively titled Blood Paradise. When Rice was on her son Christopher Rice's radio program, \"The Dinner Party with Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn\", she announced that her novel Prince Lestat could be considered a sequel to her novel The Queen of the Damned since many characters that appeared therein will reappear in Prince Lestat, while at the same time, readers might see a revisiting of key themes. Rice's Vampire Chronicles have sold over 20 million copies in the U.S. The first book in the Vampire Chronicles series, Interview with the Vampire (1976), was adapted into a 1994 film starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Universal Pictures acquired the motion picture rights to The Vampire Chronicles novels in August 2014."

They face one question – Is Earth ready to join an intergalactic society? This is one of the thirty-five juvenile novels that comprise the Winston Science Fiction set, which were published in the 1950s for a readership of teen-aged boys. The typical protagonist in these books, like Ron Barron, was a boy in his late teens who was proficient in the art of electronics, a hobby that was easily available to the readers."

The 52 completed novels of the Dray Prescot series were written by Bulmer between 1972 and 1997, when a stroke stopped his writing, also the later Dray Prescot books, after 1988, were originally only published in German. The series is in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series."

The book compiles more than 350 photographs made by amateur and professional photographers in Dallas, Texas, during the November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, and includes interviews with many of the people who made the images, some of which had never been published prior to the book's release. Pictures of the Pain was released to favorable reviews, both by critics and by its participants. Dan Rather called it \"the definitive book\" on the assassination. An abridged version, That Day In Dallas, was released four years later."

  "text" : "People of Nepal is a 1967 book by Dor Bahadur Bista. The book is the first relatively comprehensive view of the vast array of Nepalese cultures, castes and ethnic groups, with descriptions of their unique customs. It is written by anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista. Bista visited East Nepal with Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf in the 1950s. People of Nepal contains his ethnographic notes from the visit. University of Zurich professor Werner M. Egli wrote in his 2014 book The Sunuwar of Nepal and their Sense of Communication that People of Nepal is a \"classic\". Anthropologist and linguist Mark Turin, a professor at the University of British Columbia, wrote in his 2012 book A Grammar of the Thangmi Language that People of Nepal was \"definitive\". The Nepali Times called Bista's book a \"seminal work\"."
