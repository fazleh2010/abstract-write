  "text" : "(For other uses, see Heart of Darkness (disambiguation).) Heart of Darkness (1899) is a novella by Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad, about a voyage up the Congo River into the Congo Free State, in the heart of Africa, by the story's narrator Marlow. Marlow tells his story to friends aboard a boat anchored on the River Thames, London, England. This setting provides the frame for Marlow's story of his obsession with the ivory trader Kurtz, which enables Conrad to create a parallel between London and Africa as places of darkness. Central to Conrad's work is the idea that there is little difference between so-called civilised people and those described as savages; Heart of Darkness raises questions about imperialism and racism. Originally published as a three-part serial story in Blackwood's Magazine, Heart of Darkness has been variously published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Heart of Darkness as the sixty-seventh of the hundred best novels in English of the twentieth century."

  "text" : "How Green Was My Valley is a 1939 novel by Richard Llewellyn, narrated by Huw, the main character, about his Welsh family and the mining community in which they live. The author had claimed that he based the book on his own personal experiences but this was found to be untrue after his death; Llewellyn was English-born and spent little time in Wales, though he was of Welsh descent. Llewellyn gathered material for the novel from conversations with local mining families in Gilfach Goch. The title of the novel appears in two sentences. It is first used in Chapter Thirty, after the narrator has had his first sexual experience. He sits up to \"... look down in the valley.\" He then reflects: \"How green was my Valley that day, too, green and bright in the sun.\" The phrase is used again in the novel's last sentence: \"How green was my Valley then, and the Valley of them that have gone.\" In the United States, Llewellyn won the National Book Award for favorite novel of 1940, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association."

  "text" : "How the Self Controls Its Brain is a book by Sir John Eccles, proposing a theory of philosophical dualism, and offering a justification of how there can be mind-brain action without violating the principle of the conservation of energy. The model was developed jointly with the nuclear physicist Friedrich Beck in the period 1991-1992. Eccles called the fundamental neural units of the cerebral cortex \"dendrons\", which are cylindrical bundles of neurons arranged vertically in the six outer layers or laminae of the cortex, each cylinder being about 60 micrometres in diameter. Eccles proposed that each of the 40 million dendrons is linked with a mental unit, or \"psychon\", representing a unitary conscious experience. In willed actions and thought, psychons act on dendrons and, for a moment, increase the probability of the firing of selected neurons through quantum tunneling effect in synaptic exocytosis, while in perception the reverse process takes place."

Significantly, the opening epigraph of the collection is the Peter Fonda line from the end of Easy Rider: \"We blew it.\" All of the stories are about the 1960s and the war in Vietnam, and in all of them the members of that generation fail profoundly, or are paying the costs of some profound failure on their part."

  "text" : "House of Leaves is the debut novel by American author Mark Z. Danielewski, published in March 2000 by Pantheon Books. A bestseller, it has been translated into a number of languages, and is followed by a companion piece, The Whalestoe Letters. The format and structure of House of Leaves is unconventional, with unusual page layout and style, making it a prime example of ergodic literature. It contains copious footnotes, many of which contain footnotes themselves, including references to fictional books, films or articles. Some pages contain only a few words or lines of text, arranged in strange ways to mirror the events in the story, often creating both an agoraphobic and a claustrophobic effect. The novel is also distinctive for its multiple narrators, who interact with each other in elaborate and disorienting ways. While some have attempted to describe the book as a horror story, many readers, as well as the author, define the book as a love story. Danielewski expands on this point in an interview: \"I had one woman come up to me in a bookstore and say, 'You know, everyone told me it was a horror book, but when I finished it, I realized that it was a love story.' And she's absolutely right. In some ways, genre is a marketing tool.\" House of Leaves has also been described as a \"satire of academic criticism.\""

They are designed to engage children in history by presenting the unusual, gory, or unpleasant aspects in a tongue-in-cheek manner in contrast to the formality of lessons taught in school. The series has proved exceptionally successful in terms of commercial revenue. The books are written by Terry Deary, Peter Hepplewhite and Neil Tonge and illustrated by Martin Brown, Mike Phillips, Phillip Reeve, and Kate Sheppard. The first titles in the series, The Terrible Tudors and The Awesome Egyptians, were published in June 1993. As of 2011 with more than 60 titles in the series, the books have sold over 25 million copies in over 30 languages. The books have had tie-ins with newspapers such as The Telegraph, as well as audio-book tie-ins with breakfast cereals. Deary announced that the series would officially come to an end in 2013. The Telegraph said \"after Deary was reported to have given up the bestselling series because he had run out of tales to tell...his publisher would not risk putting out any new ones\". Deary says he cannot write a new book unless commissioned, and though he has not been told to stop writing, he has not explicitly been asked to continue, citing the gamble of a new book, \"when you've got 60 titles there that you can rework and freshen up for the new audiences that are growing up all the time\", as a probable cause."

McCarthy predicts that programmable matter will someday change human life profoundly, and that its users will have the ability to program matter itself - to change it, from a computer, from hard to soft, from paper to stone, from fluorescent to super-reflective to invisible. In his science fiction, he calls this technology \"Wellstone\". The book includes interviews with researchers who are developing the technology, describes how they are learning to control its electronic, optical, thermal, magnetic, and mechanical properties, and speculates on its future development."

  "text" : "Human Action: A Treatise on Economics is a work by the Austrian economist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises. Widely considered Mises' magnum opus, it presents the case for laissez-faire capitalism based on praxeology, or rational investigation of human decision-making. It rejects positivism within economics. It defends an a priori epistemology and underpins praxeology with a foundation of methodological individualism and speculative laws of apodictic certainty. Mises argues that the free-market economy not only outdistances any government-planned system, but ultimately serves as the foundation of civilization itself. Nationalökonomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens is the 1940 German-language predecessor to Human Action."

The story begins when David stops being \"The Angriest Man In Holloway\" and begins to be \"good\" with the help of his spiritual healer, DJ GoodNews (who also shows up briefly in Hornby's A Long Way Down). The pair go about this by nominally convincing people to give their spare bedrooms to the homeless, but as their next scheme comes around, \"reversal\" (being good to people one has not been good to in the past), this proves to be fruitless and thus David gives up his strivings and his plans for a book on how to be good, appropriately named \"How to be Good.\" The protagonist, Katie, briefly encounters a minor character named Dick whose description and attitude towards music are reminiscent of the character of the same name from Hornby's first novel, High Fidelity."

  "text" : "Howl's Moving Castle is a fantasy novel by British author Diana Wynne Jones, first published in 1986 by Greenwillow Books of New York. It was a runner-up for the annual Boston Globe–Horn Book Award and it won the Phoenix Award twenty years later, recognizing its rise from relative obscurity. In 2004 it was adapted as an animated film of the same name, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Howl's Moving Castle is the first novel in the series of books called the Howl Series. This series also includes Castle in the Air, published in 1990, and House of Many Ways, published in 2008. WorldCat reports that Howl's Moving Castle is the author's work most widely held in participating libraries, followed by its first sequel Castle in the Air. For the idea Jones \"very much\" thanked \"a boy in a school I was visiting\", whose name she had noted but lost and forgotten. He had \"asked me to write a book titled The Moving Castle.\""

  "text" : "Hallowe'en Party is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in November 1969 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed for twenty-five shillings. In preparation for decimalisation on 15 February 1971, it was also priced on the dustjacket at £1.25. The US edition retailed at $5.95. The novel features Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver. A girl at a Hallowe'en party with Ariadne Oliver in attendance, claims she witnessed a murder, which at the time as she was so young, she had not realized was a murder. Soon, the girl is found murdered. Oliver calls in Poirot to find the cause of this and the next murder. This book was dedicated to P.G. Wodehouse. A review at the time of publication and another 20 years later both felt this story was not one of Agatha Christie's best, \"a disappointment\", a novel littered with loose ends and unrealized characters."

Democrats and Republicans for that matter appear more as two wings of a capitalist, imperialist party than the two vastly different political ideologies that are presented in the popular media.\"", "\"Maintaining a hold on political power and enhancing US control of the world's primary energy sources are major steps toward the twin goals that have been declared with considerable clarity: to institutionalize a radical restructuring of domestic society that will roll back the progressive reforms of a century, and to establish an imperial grand strategy of permanent world domination.\"", "\"In Hegemony or Survival, Chomsky returns to themes that have motivated most of his political writing, including the blindness of western states to their own moral failures and inconsistencies and the ruthless insistence of successive US administrations that the world will do their bidding.\"", "\"And it is essential to demand, as Chomsky does, that a country with the might of the United States stop being so selective in applying its principles. We will not allow our sovereignty to be infringed by international treaty commitments in the areas of human rights or even arms control, but we demand that others should. We rebuff the complaints of foreigners about the 650 people who remain holed up in Guantánamo kennels, denied access to lawyers and family members, with not even their names released. Yet we expect others to take heed of our protests about due process. We have official enemies -- those whose police abuses, arms shipments and electoral thefts we eagerly expose . But the sins of our allies in the war on terror  are met with ''intentional ignorance.\"", "\"Chomsky is wrong to think that individuals within the American government are not thinking seriously about the costs of alliances with repressive regimes; he is also wrong to suggest that it would be easy to get the balance right between liberty and security, or democracy and equality &ndash; or to figure out what the hell to do about Pakistan.

  "text" : "Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance is a study of the \"American Empire\" written by the American linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was first published in the United States in November 2003 by Metropolitan Books, and later republished in the United Kingdom by Penguin Books. Chomsky's main argument in Hegemony or Survival is that the socio-economic elite who control the United States have pursued an \"Imperial Grand Strategy\" since the end of World War II in order to maintain global hegemony through military, political and economic means. He argues that in doing so they have repeatedly shown a total disregard for democracy and human rights, in stark contrast to the US government's professed support for those values. Furthermore, he argues that this continual pursuit of global hegemony now threatens the existence of the human species itself because of the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Drawing historical examples from 1945 through to 2003 to support his argument, Chomsky looks at the US government's support for regimes responsible for mass human rights abuses (including ethnic cleansing and genocide), namely El Salvador, Colombia, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, South Africa and Indonesia. He also discusses US support for militant dissident groups widely considered \"terrorists\", particularly in Nicaragua and Cuba, as well as direct military interventions, such as the Vietnam War, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Afghan War and Iraq War, in order to further its power and grasp of resources. In doing so, he highlights that US foreign policy – whether controlled by Republican or Democratic administrations – still follows the same agenda of gaining access to lucrative resources and maintaining US world dominance. Mainstream press reviews in the US were mixed and were largely negative in the UK, although a review in Asia was more positive. In a speech before the UN General Assembly in September 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez openly praised the work. Sales of the book surged after the recommendation, its rank on Amazon.com rising to #1 in paperback and #6 in hardcover in only a few days."

On HMS Surprise, Aubrey and Maturin make a long voyage to bring an ambassador to Southeast Asia, rounding the southern tip of Africa. Some reviewers found the novel with \"superb depictions of life\", yet too full of nautical detail, while others found that detail part of the author's erudition and not in the way of the plot. The author showed \"capacity for creating another completely believable world\", while another reviewer said the novel is \"stretching its genre [naval adventure] but never escaping it.\""

  "text" : "Heavier Than Heaven is the name of a 2001 biography of musician Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana. It was written by Charles R. Cross. For the book, Cross desired to create the definitive Cobain biography, and over four years conducted 400+ interviews; in particular, he was granted exclusive interviews and access to Cobain's private journals, lyrics and photos, by his widow Courtney Love. Notably, neither Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl nor Cobain's mother contributed to the book. Cross took the name \"Heavier Than Heaven\" from a tour Nirvana did with the band Tad in the United Kingdom. The lead singer, Tad Doyle, was very obese; the name which was thought up by the tour promoters, was meant in part to poke fun at the inaccurate idea that Tad alone weighed more than all of the members of Nirvana put together."

  "text" : "Hawaii is a novel by James Michener. Written in episodic format like many of Michener's works, the book narrates the story of the original Hawaiians who sailed to the islands from Bora Bora, the early American missionaries (in this case, Calvinist missionaries) and merchants, and the Chinese and Japanese immigrants who traveled to work and seek their fortunes in Hawaii. The story begins with the creation of the islands themselves at the dawn of time and ends in the mid-1950s. Each section explores the experiences of different groups of arrivals. The point of view changes with each chapter, although as the novel nears its end, these points-of-view change and coalesce rapidly culminating with the \"Golden Man\", who Michener describes as racially and culturally the result of the millennia of immigration to the islands. The novel was published in 1959, the same year Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state. The book has been translated into 32 languages. The historical correctness of the novel is high, although the narrative about the early Polynesian inhabitants is based more on folklore than anthropological and archaeological sources. Currently, it is accepted that, while there was immigration from Bora Bora, Hawaii was first settled from the Marquesas Islands around 400 CE; Nuku Hiva, mentioned in this section, is part of the Marquesas."

  "text" : "The Histories (Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Ancient Greek: [his.to.rí.ai̯]; also known as The History) of Herodotus is now considered the founding work of history in Western literature. Written in 440 BC in the Ionic dialect of classical Greek, The Histories serves as a record of the ancient traditions, politics, geography, and clashes of various cultures that were known in Western Asia, Northern Africa and Greece at that time. Although not a fully impartial record, it remains one of the West's most important sources regarding these affairs. Moreover, it established the genre and study of history in the Western world (despite the existence of historical records and chronicles beforehand). The Histories also stands as one of the first accounts of the rise of the Persian Empire, as well as the events and causes of the Greco-Persian Wars between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek city-states in the 5th century BC. Herodotus portrays the conflict as one between the forces of slavery (the Persians) on the one hand, and freedom (the Athenians and the confederacy of Greek city-states which united against the invaders) on the other. The Histories was at some point divided into the nine books that appear in modern editions, conventionally named after the nine Muses."

It tells the stories of six survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, covering a period of time immediately prior to and one year after the atomic bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945. It was originally published in The New Yorker. Although the story was originally scheduled to be published over four issues, the entire edition of August 31, 1946 was dedicated to the article. The article and subsequent book are regarded as one of the earliest examples of the New Journalism, in which the story-telling techniques of fiction are adapted to non-fiction reporting. Less than two months after the publication of Hiroshima in The New Yorker, the article was printed as a book by Alfred A. Knopf and has sold over three million copies to date. Hiroshima has been continuously in print since its publication, according to later New Yorker essayist Roger Angell, because “[i]ts story became a part of our ceaseless thinking about world wars and nuclear holocaust”."

  "text" : "Heather Has Two Mommies is a children's book written by Lesléa Newman with Diana Souza and Dana Kingsbury's illustrations, first published in 1989. Google Books describes it as \"the first lesbian-themed children's book ever published\". The story is about a child, Heather, raised by lesbian women: her biological mother, Jane, who gave birth to her after artificial insemination, and her biological mother's same-sex partner, Kate. At Heather's playgroup, her family situation is discussed simply and positively, as are those of other children in other family units. Lesléa Newman related: The American Library Association ranked it the 11th most frequently challenged book in the United States in the 1990s; a similar phenomenon can be seen in the Sugartime! episode of the American television series Postcards from Buster. In the 1980s, comparable political controversy erupted in the United Kingdom over the book Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin. Comedian Bill Hicks famously included the book in one of his stand-up routines. The book and the controversy over it were parodied in the 2006 Dav Pilkey book Captain Underpants and the Preposterous Plight of the Purple Potty People. In it, the parallel-universe Miss Singerbrains (the school librarian) invites the two main characters, George and Harold, to read the book Mommy Has Two Heathers."

  "text" : "Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits (German: Menschliches, Allzumenschliches: Ein Buch für freie Geister) is a book by 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, originally published in 1878. A second part, Assorted Opinions and Maxims (Vermischte Meinungen und Sprüche), was published in 1879, and a third part, The Wanderer and his Shadow (Der Wanderer und sein Schatten), followed in 1880. The book is Nietzsche's first in the aphoristic style that would come to dominate his writings, discussing a variety of concepts in short paragraphs or sayings. Reflecting an admiration of Voltaire as a free thinker, but also a break in his friendship with composer Richard Wagner two years earlier, Nietzsche dedicated the original 1878 edition of Human, All Too Human “to the memory of Voltaire on the celebration of the anniversary of his death, May 30, 1778.” Instead of a preface, the first part originally included a quotation from Descartes's Discourse on the Method. Nietzsche later republished all three parts as a two-volume edition in 1886, adding a preface to each volume, and removing the Descartes quote as well as the dedication to Voltaire."

In this case, the novel falls into a smaller category of Carr's work in that it is suggested that the crime is the work of a supernatural being (here, a vampire). The detective is Dr. Gideon Fell, who ultimately uncovers a rational explanation for the novel's events. Carr considered this one of his best impossible crime novels."

  "text" : "He Died with a Felafel in His Hand is a non-fiction novel by Australian author John Birmingham, first published in 1994 by The Yellow Press (ISBN 1-875989-21-8). The story consists of a collection of colourful anecdotes about living in share houses in Brisbane and other cities in Australia with variously dubious housemates. The title refers to a deceased heroin addict found in one such house. The book was subsequently adapted into a popular stage play and, in 2001, was made into a film by Richard Lowenstein, starring Noah Taylor, Emily Hamilton and Sophie Lee. A sequel, The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco, was published in 1998. In 2004, to celebrate the book's ten-year anniversary, Birmingham approached comic artist Ryan Vella to produce a graphic novel of the book. The pair met in April of that year at Artspace Mackay, for the opening of the Headspace exhibition. The comic was published in September 2004 by Duffy & Snellgrove (ISBN 1-876631-95-3)."

In the book's preface, Rodney praises the state of Tanzania, which had pursued the sort of Marxist political ideology that he advocated."

The novel belongs to the Hive series, which also includes The Godwhale. Bass' Hive series of stories are replete with obvious and not-so-obvious references to nomenclature commonly used in pathology, including eponymic puns (note a male character's observation of a female character's attractive \"Howell-Jolly body\").

  "text" : "Horton Hatches the Egg is a children's book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House. The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, \"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred per cent!\" Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features. According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, the story was born in early 1940, when Geisel left a window open in his studio, and the wind fortuitously blew a sketch of an elephant on top of a sketch of a tree. However, according to later biographer Charles Cohen, this account is probably apocryphal. He found elements of Horton in earlier Dr. Seuss works, most notably the 1938 short story \"Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex\". Horton Hatches the Egg was published to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained popular with the general public. The book has also been used as the basis for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who! These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical."

She was the second historically confirmed female pharaoh, the first being Sobekneferu. (Various other women may have also ruled as pharaohs regnant before Hatshepsut, as early as Merneith almost 1500 years prior.) Hatshepsut came to the throne of Egypt in 1478 BC. Officially, she ruled jointly with Thutmose III, who had ascended to the throne the previous year as a child of about two years old. Hatshepsut was the chief wife of Thutmose II, Thutmose III’s father. She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty. According to Egyptologist James Henry Breasted she is also known as \"the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.\" Hatshepsut was the daughter and only child of Thutmose I and his primary wife Ahmose. Her husband Thutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a secondary wife named Mutnofret, who carried the title King's daughter and was probably a child of Ahmose I. Hatshepsut and Thutmose II had a daughter named Neferure. Thutmose II fathered Thutmose III with Iset, a secondary wife."

At the time it was written, no one would publish it due to its graphic descriptions of murder, child molestation, incest, coprophilia, coprophagia, urolagnia, anal-oral contact, necrophilia and rape. Hogg was finally published – with some further, though relatively minor, rewrites – in 1995 by Black Ice Books. The two successive editions have featured some correction, the last of which, published by Fiction Collective 2 in 2004, carries a note at the end stating that it is definitive."

  "text" : "Harmonia Sacra is a Mennonite shape note hymn and tune book, originally published as A Compilation of Genuine Church Music in 1832 (Winchester, Virginia) by Joseph Funk (1778–1862). The original publication was a \"four-shape\" shape note book using the shapes and syllables \"faw, sol, law, and mi\". Funk designed A Compilation of Genuine Church Music for use in singing schools. It contained 208 pages, including rudiments of music and tunes harmonized for three voices. Funk released a second edition in 1835, and a third in 1842. The 1847 fourth edition was the first publication by Joseph Funk and Sons at Singers Glen. The name was changed to Harmonia Sacra in 1851, using the original title as a subtitle. In 1851, Funk also changed from the four-shapes to the seven-shape shape note system. Rather than adopt the Aikin system, Funk devised his own. Further editions were released, including 1860, 1866, 1878, 1980 and 1993. In 1866, called the 12th edition, the three voice parts were expanded to four. After 1878 (17th edition), the rudiments of music were deleted. In 1980, the 24th edition, the format was changed, changing the old four stave oblong tunebook to an upright modern soprano-alto-tenor-bass format. The 25th edition (1993) restored the old oblong tunebook format, as well as the rudiments of music and 27 three-voice hymns from the first and second editions. A newly typeset 26th edition is available. An online edition of the 26th edition provides tunes in both four- and seven-shape settings. According to the Mennonite Encyclopedia this \"music textbook ... has reached a total issue of nearly 100,000 copies.\" The book is still is in use by Mennonites today. Most singings are held in the Dayton-Harrisonburg area of Virginia."

  "text" : "How To Make Trouble And Influence People (ISBN 0958554927) was the title of a self-published book from 1996 chronicling the history of political pranks and acts of creative subversion in Australia. The book consists of a series of short paragraphs describing incidents, as well as facsimiles of flyers, posters and graffiti. It also includes an interview with Greg Wadley, author of the zine Loser. The incidents detailed in How To Make Trouble date from the early colonial days to recent times, and include both explicitly political and non-political pranks. They include industrial disputes in the 1920s, recent environmental and anti-war protests, as well as acts of inspired vandalism and detournement. As such, this book can be said to be a testament to the larrikin tradition of Australia, and its numerous manifestations throughout history. Two sequels were released, How To Stop Whining And Start Living and Revenge Of The Troublemaker. All of these are attributed to the \"Question Mark Collective\". It is believed that one of the compilers was Iain McIntyre. Copies of these books may possibly be found in anarchist and countercultural bookshops in Australia. The book influenced the production of the ABC Radio Background Briefing program on Culture Jamming: How To Make Trouble And Influence People, broadcast in 1998 and also featured in Head Space No 4, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's monthly Arts and Culture Magazine. A collected and expanded version of all three of the original publications, titled How to Make Trouble and Influence People: Pranks, Hoaxes, Graffiti and Mischief-making from across Australia (ISBN 9780980415117) has been collated by Iain McIntyre and Breakdown Press for release in October 2009. The 276 page book includes expanded historical listings, over 300 photographs and 14 interviews with Australian trouble makers."

  "text" : "How to Win Friends and Influence People is one of the first best-selling self-help books ever published. Written by Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) and first published in 1936, it has sold over 30 million copies world-wide, and went on to be named #19 on Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential books in 2011. Leon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon & Schuster took one of the 14-week courses given by Carnegie in 1934. Shimkin persuaded Carnegie to let a stenographer take notes from the course to be revised for publication. The original book contained sections providing colorful anecdotes and insightful wisdom. It gave instruction in handling people, winning friends, bringing people to your way of thinking, being a great leader, and navigating home life successfully. Carnegie combined age-old truisms with the emerging field of psychology to present a handbook in human relations which was interesting and accessible. Emphasizing the use of other's egotistical tendencies to one's advantage, Carnegie maintained that success could be found by charm, appreciation, and personality. The book sold exceptionally well from the start, going through 17 editions in its first year. In 1981, a new revised edition containing updated language and anecdotes was released. The revised edition reduced the number of sections from 6 to 4, eliminating sections on effective business letters and improving marital satisfaction. In 2011, a 3rd edition was released, titled \"How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age\". This edition was written by Dale Carnegie & Associates. It takes Carnegie's time-tested prescription for relationship and business success, and applies them to the digital age."

  "text" : "Heaven and Hell is a philosophical essay by Aldous Huxley published in 1956. Huxley derived the title from William Blake's book The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. The essay discusses the relationship between bright, colorful objects, geometric designs, psychoactives, art, and profound experience. Heaven and Hell metaphorically refer to what Huxley conceives to be two contrary mystical experiences that potentially await when one opens the \"doors of perception\"—not only in a mystical experience, but in prosaic life. Huxley uses the term antipodes to describe the \"regions of the mind\" that one can reach via meditation, vitamin deficiencies, self-flagellation, fasting, or (most effectively, he says) with the aid of certain chemical substances like LSD or mescaline. Essentially, Huxley defines these \"antipodes\" of the mind as mental states that one may reach when one's brain is disabled (from a biological point of view) and can then be conscious of certain \"regions of the mind\" that one would otherwise never be able to pay attention to, due to the lack of biological/utilitarian usefulness. Huxley states that while these states of mind are biologically useless, they are nonetheless spiritually significant, and furthermore, are the singular 'regions' of the mind from which all religions are derived. For example, he says that the Medieval Christians frequently experienced \"visions\" of Heaven and Hell during the winter, when their diets were severely hampered by lack of critical nutrients in their food supplies (vitamin B, vitamin C)—these people frequently contracted Scurvy and other deficiencies, causing them to hallucinate. He also said that Christians and other religions fast in order to make themselves delirious, thus inducing visions and views of these \"antipodes of the mind\". Today, Huxley says people can reach these states of mind without harm to their bodies with the aid of certain drugs. Essentially, Huxley says this state of mind allows a person to be conscious of things that would not normally concern him because they have nothing to do with the typical concerns of the world. In his earlier narrative The Doors of Perception (1954), Huxley recounted in detail his first experience of mescaline."

  "text" : "How the Mind Works is a 1997 book by Canadian-American cognitive scientist Steven Pinker. The book attempts to explain some of the human mind's poorly understood functions and quirks in evolutionary terms. Drawing heavily on the paradigm of evolutionary psychology articulated by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, Pinker covers subjects as diverse as vision, emotion, feminism, and, in the final chapter, \"the meaning of life\". He argues for both a computational theory of mind and a neo-Darwinist / adaptationist approach to evolution, all of which he sees as the central components of evolutionary psychology. He criticizes difference feminism in his book because he believes scientific research has shown that women and men differ little or not at all in their moral reasoning. This book was a Pulitzer Prize Finalist."

  "text" : "Haunted is a 2005 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The plot is a frame story for a series of 23 short stories, most preceded by a free verse poem. Each story is followed by a chapter of the main narrative, is told by a character in main narrative, and ties back into the main story in some way. Typical of Palahniuk's work, the dominant motifs in Haunted are sexual deviance, sexual identity, homosexuality, desperation, social distastefulness, disease, murder, death, and existentialism. The synopsis on the dustjacket describes Haunted as a satire of reality television, but according to Palahniuk, the novel is actually about \"the battle for credibility\" that has resulted from the ease with which one can publish through the use of modern technology. The cover of the 2006 U.S. trade paperback reprint features a glow-in-the-dark image."

A biting satire of the New Soviet man, it was written in 1925 at the height of the NEP period, when communism appeared to be weakening in the Soviet Union. It's generally interpreted as an allegory of the Communist revolution and \"the revolution's misguided attempt to radically transform mankind.\" Its publication was initially prohibited in the Soviet Union but circulated in samizdat until it was officially released in the country in 1987. It is \"one of novelist Mikhail Bulgakov's most beloved stories\" featuring a stray dog \"named Sharik who takes human form\" as a slovenly and narcissistic incarnation of the New Soviet Man.The novel has become a cultural phenomenon in Russia, known and discussed by people \"from schoolchildren to politicians.\"It has become a subject of critical argument, was filmed in both Russian and Italian-language versions, and adapted in English as a play and an opera."

She later wrote a third book about this company, Deadly Pink. She does not consider the second or third book sequels, despite their taking place in the same universe as the first one, and she says the three books can be read in any order. Vande Velde says, \"Heir Apparent was a lot of fun to write because it's about a girl caught in a virtual-reality-type game. Even though Giannine finds herself in a vaguely medieval world, I didn't have to worry about historical accuracy. I also was able to keep throwing all sorts of things at her -- a dragon, an army of ghosts, and a poetry-loving/head-chopping statue.\""

  "text" : "Hammer's Slammers is a 1979 collection of military science fiction short stories by author David Drake. It follows the career of a future mercenary tank regiment called Hammer's Slammers, after their leader, Colonel Alois Hammer. This collection, and other novels and stories in the same setting, are collectively called the Hammer stories, and the setting is called the Slammers universe or the Hammerverse. Each of the stories in the novel follows various members of Hammer's Regiment in one campaign, starting with how and why the government of Friesland raised the outfit as an auxiliary regiment to put down a revolt on a Friesland colony planet named Melpomene, in which Colonel Hammer is the focal character, and who changes the outfit from a Friesland regiment to an independent mercenary organization. The reader is also introduced to recurring characters like Joachim Steuben, a gay sociopath and master marksman devoted to his colonel; Sergeant (later Major) Danny Prichard; recruit (later Sergeant-Commander) Rob Jenne; Margritte DiManzio, whose husband is killed by mercenaries from a different regiment and signs on with the Slammers; and Sergeant \"Ripper Jack\" Scratchard, who shows how the Slammers infantry ties in with the Regiment's combat cars and hovertanks. The book concludes with the story \"Standing Down,\" in which Friesland revolutionaries hire the Slammers to overthrow the government of Friedland. Colonel Hammer takes over the revolution and the planet, becomes President of Friedland, and Hammer's Regiment becomes the 1st Regiment of the Friesland Defense Force. Drake based the Hammer's Slammers on his service with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam and Cambodia in 1970, however Drake also borrows plots from historical or mythological sources for many of the Hammer's Slammers stories as with his other work. For example, he retells the story of Jason and the Argonauts in The Voyage, and part of the Odyssey in Cross the Stars. Other stories borrow from pulp-era fiction (The Sharp End is based on Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest)."

  "text" : "Hunters of Dune is the first of two books written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson to conclude Frank Herbert's original Dune series of science fiction novels. The cliffhanger ending of Frank Herbert's Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) and his subsequent death in 1986 left some overarching plotlines unresolved. Released on August 22, 2006, Hunters continues the story of the danger posed to humanity by a remote, unnamed, but ever-present \"great enemy\". The novel is based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert, but Hunters and its 2007 sequel Sandworms of Dune represent the author's version of what Frank Herbert referred to as Dune 7, his own planned seventh novel in the Dune series. The first five chapters of the novel were available prior to the novel's publication via free download from the official Dune website, released monthly from March until July in 2006."

  "text" : "Hitler's Pope is a book published in 1999 by the British journalist and author John Cornwell that examines the actions of Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII, before and during the Nazi era, and explores the charge that he assisted in the legitimization of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in Germany, through the pursuit of a Reichskonkordat in 1933. The book is critical of Pius' conduct during the Second World War, arguing that he did not do enough, or speak out enough, against the Holocaust. Cornwell argued that Pius's entire career as the nuncio to Germany, Cardinal Secretary of State, and pope was characterized by a desire to increase and centralize the power of the Papacy, and that he subordinated opposition to the Nazis to that goal. He further argued that Pius was antisemitic and that this stance prevented him from caring about the European Jews. Various commentators have challenged the book's leading ideas, or challenged factual assertions contained within it. Jewish historian of the Holocaust Martin Gilbert credits Pius XII with various actions which saved Jews, and notes that the Nazi security forces referred to him as the \"mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals\". Pius XII maintained links to the German Resistance. and in the assessment of Catholic historian Frank Coppa writing for the Encyclopedia Britannica, Cornwell's depiction of Pius XII as anti-Semitic lacks \"credible substantiation\". The author has been praised for attempting to bring into the open the debate on the Catholic Church's relationship with the Nazis, but also accused of making unsubstantiated claims and ignoring positive evidence. The author has moderated some of his allegations, since publication of the book. In 2004, Cornwell stated that Pius XII \"had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany. ... But even if his prevarications and silences were performed with the best of intentions, he had an obligation in the postwar period to explain those actions\". He similarly stated in 2008 that Pius XII's \"scope for action was severely limited\", but that \"[n]evertheless, due to his ineffectual and diplomatic language in respect of the Nazis and the Jews, I still believe that it was incumbent on him to explain his failure to speak out after the war. This he never did.\" In 2009 he described Pacelli as effectively a \"fellow traveller\" of the Nazis."

  "text" : "How to Lie with Statistics is a book written by Darrell Huff in 1954 presenting an introduction to statistics for the general reader. Huff was a journalist who wrote many \"how to\" articles as a freelancer, but was not a statistician. The book is a brief, breezy, illustrated volume outlining errors when it comes to the interpretation of statistics, and how these errors may create incorrect conclusions. In the 1960s and 1970s, it became a standard textbook introduction to the subject of statistics for many college students. It has become one of the best-selling statistics books in history, with over one and a half million copies sold in the English-language edition. It has also been widely translated. Themes of the book include \"Correlation does not imply causation\" and \"Using random sampling\". It also shows how statistical graphs can be used to distort reality, for example by truncating the bottom of a line or bar chart, so that differences seem larger than they are, or by representing one-dimensional quantities on a pictogram by two- or three-dimensional objects to compare their sizes, so that the reader forgets that the images do not scale the same way the quantities do. The original edition contained humorous illustrations by artist Irving Geis. In a UK edition these were replaced with cartoons by Mel Calman."

Rather, House of Incest is a surrealistic look within the narrator's subconscious mind as she attempts to escape from a dream in which she is trapped, or in Nin's words, as she attempts to escape from \"the woman's season in hell.\""

It corresponds temporally to the first volume of Nin's published diaries, written between October 1931 and October 1932, yet is radically different, in that that book begins with a description of the landscape of and around her home and never mentions her husband, whereas \"Henry and June\" begins with discussion of Nin's sex life and is full of her struggles and passionate relationship with husband Hugo, and then, as the novel/memoir progresses, other lovers. This, the first of currently five volumes of unexpurgated diaries, concentrates on her passionate involvement with the writer Henry Miller and his wife June Miller. It is noteworthy that Nin's source material —her diaries —was able to spawn two dramatically different narratives about the same time period, both widely read and praised. The expurgated diary reveals Nin the philosopher and amateur but astute psychologist. The unexpurgated diary reveals a woman breaking out into wild sexual discovery. It is introduced by her second—coterminous—husband. A film based on the book was released in 1990."

  "text" : "How to Design Programs (HtDP) is a textbook by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt and Shriram Krishnamurthi on the systematic design of computer programs published in 2001 by MIT Press. The book introduces the concept of a design recipe, a six-step process for creating programs from the problem statement. While the book was originally used in conjunction with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), it has been adopted at a number of colleges and universities for the teaching of program design principles. According to HtDP, the design process starts with a careful analysis of the problem statement with the goal of extracting a rigorous description of the kinds of data that the desired program consumes and produces. The structure of these data descriptions determines the organization of the program. The book therefore carefully introduces more and more complex kinds of data, which sets it apart from every other introductory programming book. It starts from atomic forms of data and then progresses to compound forms of data, including data that can be arbitrarily large. For each kind of data definition, the book explains how to organize the program in principle, thus enabling a programmer who encounters a new form of data to still construct a program systematically. Like Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), HtDP relies on a variant of the Scheme programming language. Indeed, it comes with its own programming environment, dubbed DrRacket, which provides a series of programming languages. The first language supports only functions, atomic data and simple structures. Each language adds expressive power to the previous one. With the exception of the largest teaching language, all languages for HtDP are functional programming languages. In the 2004 paper The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum, the authors distinguish the pedagogical focus of HtDP from that of SICP, and show how HtDP was designed as a textbook to address certain issues that some students and teachers had with SICP."

Shortly thereafter it was released as a novel by Playboy Publishing. The book details the course of his career, which began in the late 1940s. In it, he challenges the sanctity of organized religion and other societal and political conventions he perceived as having hypocritical tendencies, and widened the boundaries of free speech. The title is a parody of the 1936 bestseller How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie."

  "text" : "Horrible Science is a sister series of books to Horrible Histories, written by Nick Arnold (with the exception of Evolve or Die, which is written by Phil Gates), illustrated by Tony de Saulles and published in the UK and India by Scholastic. They are designed to get children interested in science by concentrating on the trivial, unusual, gory, or unpleasant. Amazon.com reviews of books in the series sometimes attribute their children's interested in science to the series. The books are in circulation in 24 countries, and over 4 million books have been sold in the UK alone. Nick Arnold released a paper entitled \"Teaching Science the Horrible Way\", in which he demonstrates the reasons why the Horrible Science series has a positive contribution to learning. According to Arnold, Horrible Science books are based on everyday topics and key areas of the curriculum. The range of approaches used in Horrible Science books are intended to emphasise the drama and excitement and wonder of science. Science words and concepts are introduced gradually often using humour or fact files. Although mathematics is not needed at the level of science covered in the books, some activities require calculators. The books contain experiments under the heading Dare you discover… The experiments do not require expensive or elaborate equipment. Several of the books end with thoughts on how science will shape our future. On his website, Nick Arnold also has downloadable experiments for teachers to use in the classroom as an aid to his books (e.g. the Horrible Hydrogen experiment at )."

  "text" : "Hornblower in the West Indies, or alternately Admiral Hornblower in the West Indies, is one of the novels in the series that CS Forester wrote about fictional Royal Navy officer Horatio Hornblower. All the other novels in the series take place during the wars with revolutionary and Napoleonic France; this one, however, takes place when Britain is at peace, May 1821 - October 1823. Hornblower has been promoted rear-admiral and has been named in command of the West Indies station (i.e., the Caribbean) with a squadron consisting of three frigates and fourteen brigs and schooners. It is the last Hornblower novel chronologically, although at least one short story (The Last Encounter) is set after the events in this novel. In the Royal Navy of the early nineteenth century, promotion from captain to admiral was based solely on seniority. The distinguished officer Edward Berry was promoted to captain in 1797 and did not become a rear-admiral until 1821. Hornblower was made a captain in 1805; thus, seniority should not have brought promotion to Hornblower until the mid-1830s or later. Like some other Hornblower novels, Forester wrote it in the form of several novellas that can be read independently."

The book takes place in 1993 with Saddam Hussein planning to retaliate against the United States after the events of the Gulf War. When the United States defeats Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam Hussein plans to humiliate the victors by stealing the American Declaration of Independence and publicly burning it on 4 July in full view of world media. To achieve this, his Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations enlists the help of Antonio Cavalli, a lawyer and one of the leading figures of the New York mafia, for a sum of $100,000,000. An Israeli, Hannah Kopec, a young ex-model Mossad agent with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, is involved in a plot to assassinate him. In the United States, the government finds that the Declaration of Independence has been swapped with a forgery. Scott Bradley, a Yale Law professor, who has been working undercover tracking Kopec through Paris, is assigned by the CIA to work with her to recover the document before 4 July."

The first segment of the book, \"Dick Contino's Blues,\" is a novella about Contino tracking down a serial killer while trying to repair his public image after being labeled a draft-dodger.

It incorporates the effects of new Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation into existing legislation to provide a consolidated \"as amended\" text of the current statute book. Halsbury's Statutes was created in 1929. The full title of this work was The Complete Statutes of England Classified and Annotated in Continuation of Halsbury’s Laws of England and for ready reference entitled Halsbury’s Statutes of England. As indicated by the title, the new work was to be a companion to Halsbury’s Laws of England and therefore bears the name of Lord Halsbury. The first edition, in twenty volumes, appeared between 1929 and 1931. The new encyclopedia was based on the design of the earlier Butterworths’ Twentieth Century Statutes (Annotated), a work in five volumes covering the Acts of 1900 to 1909, which had been kept up to date by annual supplemental volumes. Like its companion, Halsbury's Laws, it was arranged by subject matter. This new work, however, expanded on the previous statutory work in that it included all primary legislation in force at the time of publication. The second edition in 33 volumes was published from 1948 to 1954. The current edition (the fourth), in fifty volumes, was published between 1985 and 1992, and is supplemented by an annual hardbound supplement and periodic loose-leaf updates. It is published by LexisNexis Butterworths. Individual volumes are reissued when there has been a significant impact on the subject matter concerned through changes in legislation. The complete set consists of the main volumes, the index, tables of statutes, secondary legislation and cases, the annual Cumulative Supplement and the quarterly looseleaf service. Halsbury's Statutes is also available as a searchable electronic archive on a paid subscription basis."

The authors define both the title of this book as well as their goals in writing it on page one in the following manner: \"Our mission in writing this book for students and parents is to create greater awareness of the small, distinctive cluster of colleges and universities of excellence that are available to gifted college-bound students.\" In the introduction, the authors further explain their aim by referring specifically to \"the group historically known as the 'Little Ivies' (including Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury, Swarthmore, Wesleyan, and Williams)\" which the authors say have \"scaled the heights of prestige and selectivity and also turn away thousands of our best and brightest young men and women.\" The second edition includes the assessment of all the institutions considered \"Little Ivies\" except Connecticut College. Connecticut College is referenced on three occasions in the book for its affiliation and student exchange program with other Little Ivies, and the college is included in Appendix II as another college of excellence. In this book, the authors (using the same criteria often used to evaluate Ivy League schools) discuss thirty American schools that are small in size and are either liberal arts colleges or universities that emulate them. The Hidden Ivies: 50 Top Colleges - From Amherst to Williams - That Rival the Ivy League, the second edition of the guide published in 2009, evaluates fifty \"renowned academic institutions.\" Nine of the fifty schools in the second edition are located in the Midwestern United States, 24 in the Northeastern United States, 11 in the Southern United States, and six in the Western United States."

  "text" : "Holiday Snapshots is a 1999 photography collection of black and white and color images by British photographer David Hamilton, continuing his interest in adolescent girls, nudity and erotica. The book includes an introduction by Liliane James and captions by James and Hamilton's ex-wife Gertrude Hamilton. The book contains many images previously unpublished from sessions dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, not only Hamilton's formal portraits, but also candid images of his models indoors and poolside, diving, leaping, stretching, playing or sunbathing. Thus there is a much greater variety of poses here than in previous books. The book is published by Edition Olms, and has three hundred and forty photos over two hundred and fifteen pages. Holiday Snapshots received a limited distribution because it was privately printed and intended to be sold primarily via Hamilton's now defunct website, Hamilton-Archives.com. Along with two of Hamilton's other photography books, Twenty Five Years of an Artist and Private Collection, Holiday Snapshots was placed on the list of \"banned\" books in New Zealand. Not all of Hamilton's works are banned in New Zealand; Dreams of a Young Girl and The Age of Innocence, for example, remain \"unrestricted.\" Needless to say, all of Hamilton's titles, including this one, when available, sell openly in other countries, including the United States."

  "text" : "Helena, published in 1950, is the sole historical novel of Evelyn Waugh. It follows the quest of Helena to find the relics of the cross on which Christ was crucified. Helena, a Christian, was the mother of the Roman emperor Constantine I. The book has been described as lacking the characteristic biting satire for which Waugh is best known. However, the figure of Constantius Chlorus, Constantine's father, was interpreted by friends of the novelist as a caricature of Field-Marshal Bernard Montgomery, a man Waugh mocked as a vainglorious social climber. More generally, the corruption and instability of the Roman society Waugh describes is reminiscent of the malaise and pragmatism that prevails over tradition and chivalric ethics at the end of the Sword of Honour trilogy. Helena's saintliness does not allow her to save her son from an imperial destiny she fears and disapproves of (at one point she fantasises about him becoming a provincial colonel); nor is she able to save her innocent grandson Crispus from being murdered on Constantine's orders in a palace struggle. The novel includes the unlikely tradition from Geoffrey of Monmouth that Helena was a British princess, daughter of King Coel. Waugh always described Helena as his best work. Since his death it has received little critical attention and is usually regarded even by admirers as a minor work."

It is traditionally believed to have been authored by 16th-century poet Tulsidas in the Awadhi language, and is his best known text apart from the Ramcharitmanas. The word \"chālīsā\" is derived from \"chālīs\", which means the number forty in Hindi, as the Hanuman Chalisa has 40 verses (excluding the couplets at the beginning and at the end). Hanuman Chalisa is a devotional hymn dedicated to Lord Hanuman. It is recited to get energy and concentration. Hanuman is the source of immense energy and focus. Reciting Hanuman Chalisa channelizes energy and gives a total focus of mind and body. Hanuman is a vanara (a monkey-like humanoid), a devotee of Ram, and one of the central characters in the Indian epic poem, the Ramayan. Folk tales acclaim the powers of Hanuman. The qualities of Hanuman – his strength, courage, wisdom, celibacy, devotion to Rama and the many names by which he was known – are detailed in the Hanuman Chalisa. Recitation or chanting of the Hanuman Chalisa is a common religious practice. The Hanuman Chalisa is the most popular hymn in praise of Hanuman, and is recited by millions of Hindus every day."

  "text" : "High Weirdness By Mail – A Directory of the Fringe: Crackpots, Kooks & True Visionaries, by Ivan Stang (ISBN 0-671-64260-X) is a 1988 book dedicated to an examination of \"weird culture\" by actually putting the reader in touch with it by mail. The book is divided into sections—\"Weird Science,\" \"UFO Contactees,\" \"Drug Stuff,\" and others, and each section contains a variety of mini-articles describing organizations. Each organization article concludes with a mailing address (and in some cases, phone numbers). Several years after the book's publication, Stang reported on the newsgroup alt.slack that his inclusion of entries for white supremacist groups in the book caused his name to be mentioned by those groups as a possible target for retaliation. (The book's commentaries on various hate groups were less than flattering.) Stang reported this incident to the FBI, but did not receive any actual harassment or threats from the groups in question. The Association for Consciousness Exploration produced a follow-up lecture by Rev. Stang on cassette entitled High Weirdness by Mail, recorded live at the 1993 WinterStar Symposium."

  "text" : "Hayom Yom (Hebrew: היום יום‎‎, \"Today is day ...\") is a calendar for the Hebrew year of 5703 (1942-3), compiled by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at the behest of his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, in the winter of 1942. For each day, the calendar prescribed sections of Chumash, Tehillim, and Tanya for study that day; this practice is known in Chabad-Lubavitch as Chitas (חת\"ת). Each day's portion of Chumash is studied with the corresponding Rashi commentary. Each day's entry also noted historical events that happened on that day, or Lubavitcher customs associated with that day, and/or a short inspirational thought for the day, generally taken from the works of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. In describing this work, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak wrote: \"A book that is small in format ... but bursting with pearls and diamonds of choicest quality ... A splendid palace of Chasidism.\" The calendar was never reissued for subsequent years, but has been reprinted many times, and is still studied. In many Lubavitcher synagogues, the entry for each day is read aloud after the morning service."

  "text" : "Here There Be Dragons is a children’s book by Hugo- and Nebula-award winning author, Roger Zelazny. It is one of two stories he wrote for children, the other being Way Up High, and one of three books without heroic protagonists. The two children’s books were first published with separate dust jackets but sold only in shared slipcases bearing the title Here There Be Dragons/Way Up High . One thousand copies of each book were produced in 1992 signed by Zelazny with illustrations by Vaughn Bodē. Zelazny wrote Here There Be Dragons and Way Up High for his children in 1968-69. He admired the work of underground comics artist Vaughn Bodē and commissioned him to illustrate the two books. The drawings were exhibited at the 1969 World Science Fiction Convention in St. Louis, but before the books could be published Bodē informed Zelazny that although Zelazny owned the pictures he did not have the reproduction rights. Christopher S. Kovacs in his literary biography of Zelazny explains the issue: “Zelazny saw the book as two of his tales illustrated by Bodē, but Bodē viewed it as a showcase of his art illuminated by Zelazny’s text.” The publication of the books foundered when Zelazny and Bodē insisted on equal royalties. Bodē died in 1975 and his estate agreed to the publication of the books with Bodē’s illustrations in 1992."

  "text" : "How to Survive a Robot Uprising: Tips on Defending Yourself Against the Coming Rebellion is a semi-satirical book by Daniel Wilson published in November 2005. The book gives tongue-in-cheek advice on how one can survive in the event that robots become too intelligent and rebel against the human race. How to Survive a Robot Uprising is partially based on scientific fact, and is a prime example of deadpan humor. Wired magazine gave it a 2006 Rave Award, calling it \"equal parts sci-fi send-up and technical primer\". Maclean's called the book \"very funny and highly informative.\" In 2007, the American Library Association designated the book a 2007 ALA “Popular Paperback for Young Adults”. Wilson received a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the summer of 2005, Paramount Pictures optioned film rights to the book and hired Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (both members of The State comedy troupe and co-creators of the Reno 911! television series) to write a script based on the book. On April 26, 2006 comedian Mike Myers signed with Paramount to star in the movie adaptation."

  "text" : "Hermsprong: or, Man As He Is Not is a 1796 philosophical novel by Robert Bage. It is the main work for which Bage is remembered and was his last novel. He had previously published a novel entitled Man As He Is. The novel was regarded as radical at the time it was published. It was shaped by the revolutionary ideas of its period and expresses some feminist views through two of its characters, the eponymous hero and Maria Fluart. The views voiced by Fluart were applauded by Mary Wollstonecraft. The novel has a somewhat disjointed structure. The first section has a strong philosophical content. The latter half then changes to a sentimental novel form and approximates to a romance. The philosophical challenge of the novel is that it concerns an American who has been raised entirely by American Indians, without either formal education or religion. With only nature to teach him, he sees through the hypocrisy of society and English manners. The novel is notable for pursuing the theme of the noble savage and, in particular, nativism. Throughout the novel he repeatedly uses the terms \"pride\" and \"prejudice\" in just the senses picked up by Jane Austen in her novel of that title."

The story surrounds a school that is well liked by its students notably because of its many eccentric teachers. However, the students must make a good grade on a standardized test (which turns out in the end to be a revising test on multiple subjects they regularly learn) lest they be sent to an adjacent school, which requires uniforms to be worn and is incredibly dull."

  "text" : "Hard Tack and Coffee: The Unwritten Story of Army Life (1887) is a memoir by John D. Billings. Billings was a veteran of the 10th Massachusetts Volunteer Light Artillery Battery in the American Civil War. Originally published in 1888, Hard Tack and Coffee quickly became a best seller, and is now considered one of the most important books written by a Civil War veteran. The book is abundantly illustrated by the pen and ink drawings of Charles Reed, also a veteran, who served as bugler in the 9th Massachusetts Battery. Reed received the Medal of Honor for saving the life of his battery commander at Gettysburg. \"Hard Tack and Coffee\" is not about battles, but rather about how the common Union soldiers of the Civil War lived in camp and on the march. What would otherwise be a mundane subject is enlivened by Billings' humorous prose and Reed's superb drawings which are based on the sketches he kept in his journal during the war. The book is noteworthy as it covers the details of regular soldier life, and as such has become a valuable resource for Civil War reenactors. The volume is divided into twenty-one chapters which treat the origins of the Civil War, enlisting, how soldiers were sheltered, life in tents, life in log huts, unlucky soldiers and shirkers (\"Jonahs and Beats\"), Army rations, offenses and punishments, a day in camp, raw recruits, special rations and boxes from home, foraging, corps and corps badges, some inventions and devices of the war, the army mule, hospitals and ambulances, clothing, breaking camp and marching, army wagon trains, road and bridge builders, and signal flags and torches. Some of the information is specific to Billings' experiences as a Massachusetts volunteer artillery veteran. However, much of it is very useful to anyone researching or simply reading about the ordinary soldier in the Union army. Reed's drawings add a great deal to the text. Billings has been described as a skilful writer, both humorous and informative. The historian Henry Steele Commager called the work \"one of the most entertaining of all civil war books\"."

  "text" : "High Priest is a book by Timothy Leary. It was originally published in 1968 by New American Library, and was reprinted in 1995 by Ronin Publishing. Written before Leary's incarceration on drug-related charges, it is an autobiographical account of his experiences from 1959 to 1962, a period that roughly coincides with his employment as a lecturer in clinical psychology at Harvard University. The book is written in the form of 16 \"trips,\" each involving a \"guide,\" among whom are such influential 1960s figures as Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), Ralph Metzner, Huston Smith, and William S. Burroughs. Notably, High Priest includes Leary's account of his first use of psilocybin mushrooms in Cuernevaca, Mexico in 1960, the Concord Prison Experiment that began in 1961, and the Good Friday Experiment of 1962. It also includes detailed reports of his psychedelic experiences while using psilocybin pills, LSD, and DMT."

  "text" : "The History of North Dakota is a book written by Elwyn B. Robinson covering the history of the U.S. state of North Dakota. The book's coverage spans from several thousand years ago at the time when Native Americans first settled the area that would become present-day North Dakota up through the 20th Century. The book, published by University of Nebraska Press in 1966, was the first scholarly book covering the full-scope of North Dakota's history and has remained the definitive history of the state. The first edition contained 599 pages, 32 pages of illustration, and line drawings by Jack Brodie. Elwyn B. Robinson (1905–1985) was a professor of history at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. At the 75th Anniversary Convocation of UND on November 6, 1958, Robinson presented a speech entitled \"The Themes of North Dakota History.\" The speech received great attention and would eventually result in the publication of History of North Dakota in 1966. The book won the Award of Merit of the American Association for State and Local History."

  "text" : "High Justice is a 1974 collection of science fiction short stories by American writer Jerry Pournelle. It was republished in an omnibus edition with Exiles to Glory in 2009 as Exile -- and Glory. A major part of the background of these stories is the final fall of the Welfare States; Russia is never mentioned, and the US is downsliding due to inflation and political corruption. In short, Earth's civilization is about to collapse under the weight of its bureaucracies, but a new civilization is being built by determined multinational corporations. The stories were published between 1972 and 1975, and reflect Pournelle's concerns with the effects of environmentalism, welfare states, and high taxes on the ability of people to make advances in technology. At that time the Great Society, America's version of the Welfare State, was not even 10 years old. Each short story concerns itself with the problems facing large technological tasks in the near future. These include plutonium fuel breeding, deep sea thermal power, large scale food cultivation and access to fresh water. The protagonists are the agents of multinational corporations - engineers engaged in large scale projects and troubleshooters engaged in protecting said engineers. Though economic competitors are mentioned in passing, the primary antagonists are political - untrustworthy governments and covert operatives acting on their behalf. Pournelle's view of corporate mega-projects is similar to that of Robert A. Heinlein as expressed in stories such as The Man Who Sold the Moon, or more recently in the work of Tom Clancy. Top executives concentrate on financial risk, while engineers on the ground handle logistics and are extremely competent. Incompetent engineers get fired. There are no meddling vice-presidents, craven middle managers or deadhead employees of the sort generally found in any large technical effort-mostly because Pournelle's corporations lack trade unions to prevent their expulsion. The projects described in these stories reflect technologies described in Pournelle's non-fiction collection, \"A Step Farther Out\": \n*  A laser launch system for sending cargo into orbit, with MHD power generators based on rocket engines. \n*  The NERVA nuclear rocket engine project. \n*  Spacecraft using ion drives traversing the Solar System. \n*  Asteroid mining. \n*  Ocean thermal power generation with fish farming as a by-product of the artificial upwelling of cold nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean. The short novel Exiles to Glory is a sequel, featuring two characters from these stories. Another short novel, Birth of Fire, is considered by the author to also be part of this universe, and has similar themes, though it draws more from the author's military SF. Also, Pournelle has plans to add a story he currently calls \"Lisabetta\" to this series. The stories are considered by some as part of the CoDominium series, a future history stretching to the early 31st century. Certainly the themes of decay in the rich democracies are the same. The technology excludes innovations like the Langston field and the Alderson drive which are the main driving forces in the human diaspora projected for the 21st century. The publisher makes the claim that these are the stories that \"started it all\", but Pournelle himself considers it a separate \"no FTL\" universe."

  "text" : "Hunter is a 1989 novel written by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group, under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. Pierce also used this pseudonym to write the better-known The Turner Diaries, a 1978 novel with similar themes. Some consider Hunter a prequel to the Turner Diaries, detailing the rise of the racist paramilitary group termed 'The Organization', which would play a dominant role in the book. Hunter portrays the actions of Oscar Yeager (anglicization of Jäger, German for hunter), a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom pilot and Washington, D.C.-area Defense Department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and public figures advocating civil rights in the D.C. area. Yeager's crimes quickly lead to broad national repercussions and draw him into the plans of both a white nationalist group and an ambitious FBI official to take advantage of the turmoil he has helped to start. Hunter shares with The Turner Diaries Pierce's depiction of the United States as overrun by liberalism and covertly dominated by Jews. His depictions of and attitudes of the protagonists towards Jews, African-Americans, Latinos, and Asians mirror Pierce's and the National Alliance's ideology. Hunter reveals this ideology more didactically and directly than did The Turner Diaries. At the novel's beginning, the protagonist is a nonideological racist unattached to antisemitism. He gradually develops his ideology and perspectives during his campaign and through contact with the allies that he meets. Much of the story's dialogue consists of discussion and debate on the \"Jewish question.\""

It is currently published as a Mass Market Paperback of 352 pages by Pocket (Revised edition: September 15, 1990), ISBN 0-671-73335-4. Carnegie says in the preface to How to Stop Worrying and Start Living that he wrote it because he \"was one of the unhappiest lads in New York\". He said that he made himself sick with worry because he hated his position in life, which he attributes to wanting to figure out how to stop worrying. The book's goal is to lead the reader to a more enjoyable and fulfilling life, helping them to become more aware of, not only themselves, but others around them. Carnegie tries to address the everyday nuances of living, in order to get the reader to focus on the more important aspects of life."

  "text" : "How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe is a non-fiction historical book written by Thomas Cahill. Cahill argues a case for the Irish people's critical role in preserving Western Civilization from utter destruction by the Huns and the Germanic tribes (Visigoths, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Ostrogoths, etc.). The book retells the story from the collapse of the Roman Empire and the pivotal role played by members of the clergy at the time. A particular focus is placed upon Saint Patrick and retells his early struggles through slavery; basically retelling portions of The Confession of Saint Patrick. Early parts of the book examine Ireland before Patrick and the role of Saint Augustine of Hippo. Particular focus is placed upon Saint Columba and the monks he trained and the monasteries he set up in the Hiberno-Scottish mission. These holy men, according to Cahill, \"single-handedly refounded European civilization throughout the continent.\" (p. 4)"

The story is set in Cuba during the emergence of Fidel Castro. Earl Swagger is recruited as a personal bodyguard for an Arkansas politician who is visiting Havana, Cuba. Swagger is met by Frenchy Short who is now a CIA intelligence officer in Cuba and is coerced into a black bag operation to assassinate Castro. Along comes an unnamed former inmate from the Gulag (who is possibly the sniper T. Solaratov in the novel Time to Hunt) to help the young Castro with wisdom and encouragement for the Communist interests. After the historical attack on the military barracks in the failed attempt by Castro to take over the country, Swagger is put on the trail. He tracks and finds his target only to abandon the mission due to the shady nature of his former subordinate. Left to fend for himself in a country that no longer tolerates Americans, Swagger must evade and survive to return home to his wife June and son Bob Lee. Swagger is given a safe haven by a Havana prostitute whose life he saved. The Gulag inmate appears again to offer him transportation back to Florida, but when Swagger realizes that the prostitute's life is in danger he must return to Havana for a final showdown. While Swagger has been away, Bob Lee has been at home spending days at a time refining his marksmanship ability, thinking his father's absence is due to him unable to shoot a deer at the opening of the story. Bob Lee meets his father walking along the road on his way back home from his daily target practice, and is eager to tell him all about his newfound ability to shoot."

The title seems to allude to the \"Himalayan miscalculation\" that Gandhi discusses in his autobiographical article for April 14, 1919, and which retained this title as Chapter 33 in Gandhi's autobiography. Brigadier Dalvi served in the Indian Army and gives a first-person account of the war. The book was banned by the Indian Government after its publication. Because of the book, the term \"Himalayan blunder\" came to be used as a synonym for colossal failure in the context of Indian politics."

Head Games continues a theme running through the New Adventures starting from Timewyrm: Revelation in which the Doctor becomes Time's Champion, and that previous incarnations still in some sense exist within his mind. This novel suggests that the Seventh Doctor was somehow able to terminate the life of his previous incarnation on Lakertya (in the story Time and the Rani) in order to become Time's Champion. This in turn caused the Sixth Doctor to eventually turn into the Valeyard — the evil version of the Doctor seen in the serial The Trial of a Time Lord."

  "text" : "Hestia is a 1979 science fiction novel by science fiction and fantasy author C. J. Cherryh. It is an early Cherryh novel about colonists on an alien world and their interactions with the catlike natives, centering on a young engineer sent to solve the colonists' problems, and his relationship with the young native cat-woman in scanty clothing on the cover. Major themes in this novel include sexual liberation, sexual aberration, relevance of social mores, hypocrisy of social mores, personal work ethic, personal responsibility, ecological responsibility, blame-shifting, bureaucratic inertia, administrative reflex reactions, the mindset of the engineering profession, and responsibility toward indigenous peoples. Many other characters and the world itself are not developed with as much depth as those in some of Cherryh's other early works, such as Gate of Ivrel, The Pride of Chanur, Merchanter's Luck, and The Dreamstone. Notably, the alien cat-people in this novel are entirely different from the hani of the Chanur novels, being in temperament and culture somewhat more like housecats than lions."

  "text" : "Hear the Wind Sing (風の歌を聴け Kaze no uta o kike) is the first novel by Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. It first appeared in the June 1979 issue of Gunzo (one of the most influential literary magazines in Japan), and in book form the next month. The novel was adapted by Japanese director Kazuki Ōmori in a 1981 film distributed by Art Theatre Guild. An English translation by Alfred Birnbaum appeared in 1987. It is the first book in the so-called \"Trilogy of the Rat\" series of independent novels, followed by Pinball, 1973 (1980) and A Wild Sheep Chase (1982), before the later epilogue Dance Dance Dance (1988). All four books in the series have been translated into English, but Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973 (which are realist novels slightly differing from the author's later style) were never widely distributed in the English-speaking world, having only been published in Japan by Kodansha under their Kodansha English Library branding (for English Foreign Language learners), and both only as A6-sized pocketbooks. This was due to Murakami viewing the two novels as \"works from his immature period\". An omnibus English edition of Murakami's first two novels (Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973), under the title Wind/Pinball, with translations by Prof. Ted Goossen of York University, was released in the United States in August, 2015."

  "text" : "Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust is a 1996 book by American writer Daniel Goldhagen, in which he argues that the vast majority of ordinary Germans were \"willing executioners\" in the Holocaust because of a unique and virulent \"eliminationist antisemitism\" in the German political culture, which had developed in the preceding centuries. Goldhagen argues that this \"eliminationist antisemitism\" was the cornerstone of German national identity, and that this type of antisemitism was unique to Germany and because of it, ordinary German conscripts killed Jews willingly. Goldhagen asserts that this special mentality grew out of medieval attitudes from a religious basis, but was eventually secularized. The book aims to dispel several popular notions about the scope of German complicity in the Holocaust, which Goldhagen regards to be myths. These \"myths\" include: the notion that most Germans did not know about the Holocaust; that only the SS, and not average members of the Werhmacht, participated in murdering Jews; and that genocidal antisemitism was a uniquely Nazi ideology that had no historical antecedents in Germany. The book, which began as a Harvard doctoral dissertation, was written largely as an answer to Christopher Browning's 1992 book Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland. Much of Goldhagen's book is concerned with the actions of the same Reserve Battalion 101 of the Nazi German Ordnungspolizei. His narrative challenges numerous aspects of Browning's book, however. Goldhagen had already indicated his opposition to Browning's thesis in a review of Ordinary Men in the July 13, 1992 edition of The New Republic titled \"The Evil of Banality\". Goldhagen's book stoked controversy and debate in Germany and the United States. Some historians have characterized its reception as an extension of the Historikerstreit, the German historiographical debate of the 1980s that sought to explain Nazi history. The book was a \"publishing phenomenon\", achieving fame in both the United States and Germany, despite its \"mostly scathing\" reception among historians, who were unusually vocal in condemning it as ahistorical and, in the words of Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, \"totally wrong about everything\" and \"worthless\". Hitler's Willing Executioners won the American Political Science Association's 1994 Gabriel A. Almond Award in comparative politics, and the Democracy Prize of the Journal for German and International Politics. The Journal asserted that the debate fostered by Goldhagen's book helped sharpen public understanding about the past during a period of radical change in Germany."

In the book, Ellison explains, in an entertaining introductory essay, how he became a film critic and his views on film criticism in general. At the time that many of these reviews were written, he was one of the few people who worked within the genres of science fiction, horror and fantasy to openly criticize some of its most popular works. Highlights include a thorough savaging of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (entitled \"Luke Skywalker is a Nerd and Darth Vader Sucks Runny Eggs\"), wherein he describes it as \"shallow\" and \"a film without soul, without a core,\" and writing that Gremlins \"suffers from the dreaded Jerry Lewis Syndrome: it vacillates between a disingenuous homeliness and an egomaniacal nastiness.\" Ellison also used his status within the industry to expose what he felt were unjust handlings of films like Brazil and Dune by their respective studios. He also championed obscure films that he felt were of exemplary quality, like Big Trouble in Little China, which had \"some of the funniest lines spoken by any actor this year to produce a cheerfully blathering live-action cartoon that will give you release from the real pressures of your basically dreary lives\" and Joe, which he said was \"a visceral experience on a par with going black-belting with Bruce Lee. Joe will kick the shit out of you. It will set the blood slamming against your cranial walls. It will make you as cold as Ultima Thule.\" For a few years after this book was published, Ellison continued to write a film criticism column for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction but these have yet to be compiled into book form."

The book is an edited anthology of birth experiences, that demonstrate that birth can be a positive, life-affirming event, and that it need not, with the right support, be the trauma that the media often suggests childbirth is. The experiences described are diverse, ranging from caesarean births and VBAC births, to births that take place at home and in a birth centre or labour ward. All of the mothers in this book chose to have their birth care provided by an individual midwife. These stories express the experiential aspects of childbirth and are used to educate midwives. There is also a description of a miscarriage and a stillbirth and the stories explain how the women managed to overcome their feelings of grief at the event. This book set the style and content for Vernon's subsequent book, Men at Birth which describes men's experience of birth."

  "text" : "Hungry Hill is a novel by prolific British author Daphne du Maurier, published in 1943. It was her seventh novel. There have been 33 editions of the book printed. This family saga is based on the history of the Irish ancestors of Daphne du Maurier’s friend Christopher Puxley. The family resembles the Puxleys who owned mines in Allihies, a parish in County Cork. The story spans the century from 1820 to 1920 following five male characters from a family of Anglo-Irish landowners, the Brodricks, who live in a castle called Clonmere. It is divided into five sub-books and an epilogue. Each section covers part of the life of an heir. The sections include:Book One: Copper John, 1820 - 1828;Book Two: Greyhound John, 1828 - 1837;Book Three: \"Wild Johnnie,\" 1837 - 1858;Book Four: Henry, 1858 - 1874;Book Five: Hal, 1874 - 1895;Epilogue: The Inheritance, 1920; The title sometimes is thought to refer to Hungry Hill which is the highest peak in the Caha Mountains in County Cork, and du Maurier's description of the Hungry Hill is similar to the physical aspects of that place. Rather than simply referring to the hill, however, the title alludes to the curse put on the family by Morty Donovan, arch enemy of patriarch Copper John Brodrick, at the start of the novel, and the fact that the mines seem to \"swallow up\" the lives of the Brodrick family through five generations, by early death, dissipation and unhappiness. Many of the place names in the novel are imaginary, and the location is never directly stated to be Ireland, although it can be inferred from several references to \"crossing the water\" to reach to London, Hal's embarkation from Liverpool en route to Canada, and, in the Epilogue, the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921). However, the description of the Brodricks' mansion reportedly was based on the Puxleys' mansion in Carmarthenshire, South Wales. The story was made in to a film in 1947 directed by Brian Desmond Hurst"

  "text" : "The Handbook for Girl Guides or How Girls Can Help to Build Up the Empire is the full title of the book more commonly known as How Girls Can Help to Build up the Empire. It was the first handbook for Girl Guides. The author was Agnes Baden-Powell in conjunction with (then) Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Baden-Powell. It was published in May 1912 by Thomas Nelson and Sons. The book was a reworking of the famous Scouting for Boys. It was adapted for use by girls, although large sections remained unaltered and it included sections on stalking, tracking, signalling and camping. Several chapters on childcare, nursing and housewifery had been inserted and stories of heroic women and girls were sometimes substituted for the male ones. The book also contained the enrolment ceremony and details of the second- and first-class tests. This book superseded Pamphlet A: Baden-Powell Girl Guides, a Suggestion for Character Training for Girls and Pamphlet B: Baden-Powell Girl Guides, a Suggestion for Character Training for Girls by the same authors. In turn it was itself replaced by Girl Guiding in 1918. Throughout the early years of Guiding, movements in different countries started publishing their own handbooks as well. The book has been reprinted several times. In 2006, a facsimile edition of the book was available."

  "text" : "Hubris (/ˈhjuːbrɪs/, also hybris, from ancient Greek ὕβρις) describes a personality quality of extreme or foolish pride or dangerous over-confidence. In its ancient Greek context, it typically describes behavior that defies the norms of behavior or challenges the gods, and which in turn brings about the downfall, or nemesis, of the perpetrator of hubris. The adjectival form of the noun hubris is \"hubristic\". Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may unintentionally suffer consequences from the wrongful act. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. Contrary to common expectations, hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem, and a gap between inflated self perception and a more modest reality. Hubris is generally considered a sin in world religions. C. S. Lewis writes, in Mere Christianity, that pride is the \"anti-God\" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: \"Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.\""

  "text" : "Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, syn. Cochlearia armoracia) is a perennial plant of the Brassicaceae family (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, and cabbage). It is a root vegetable used as a spice. The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is now popular around the world. It grows up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) tall, and is cultivated primarily for its large, white, tapered root. The intact horseradish root has hardly any aroma. When cut or grated, however, enzymes from the now-broken plant cells break down sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Grated mash should be used immediately or preserved in vinegar for best flavor. Once exposed to air or heat it will begin to lose its pungency, darken in color, and become unpleasantly bitter tasting over time."

  "text" : "\"Heart Full of Soul\" is a song recorded by English rock group the Yardbirds in 1965. Written by Graham Gouldman, it was the Yardbirds' first single after Jeff Beck replaced Eric Clapton as lead guitarist. Released only three months after \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\" reached the top ten on the charts in the United Kingdom and the United States. The Yardbirds' first recorded the song with an Indian sitar player performing the distinctive instrumental figures. However, the group was dissatisfied with the results. Consequently, Beck developed the part on electric guitar using a fuzz box distortion unit. Music witers have described his contribution as introducing Indian-influenced guitar stylings to rock music. As one of the Yardbirds' most popular songs, it was frequently performed in concert. There are a number of live recordings, the earliest of which feature Beck, while later ones feature guitarist Jimmy Page. \"Heart Full of Soul\" appears on several of the group's compilations and renditions have been recorded by other musicians."

His adventures are usually in the company of his other animal friends who include the dachshund Schnitzel von Krumm. His arch-enemy is the tomcat Scarface Claw. (In New Zealand English a dairy is a small grocery store or corner shop). Written for pre-school children, it has become a classic bedtime storybook in New Zealand, and Lynley Dodd's books, including this one, dominate the children's section of the Premier New Zealand Bestsellers list The order of introduction of the dogs (with their house number in brackets) is: \n*  Hairy Maclary, a Scottish Terrier, (60) \n*  Hercules Morse, a Mastiff, (54) \n*  Bottomley Potts, a Dalmatian, (52) \n*  Muffin McLay, an Old English Sheepdog, (48) \n*  Bitzer Maloney, a Whippet, (36) \n*  Schnitzel Von Krumm, a Dachshund, (22) Like most of Dodd's books, it is written in anapestic verse, though it breaks into a more urgent trochaic form when the dogs encounter Scarface Claw."

As is common with Trollope's works, there are also several substantial subplots. Trollope makes constant allusions to Shakespeare's Othello throughout the novel. Trollope considered this work to be a failure; he viewed the main character as unsympathetic, and the secondary characters and plots as much more lively and interesting, but it is one of his best known novels. It was adapted for BBC One in 2004 by Andrew Davies as He Knew He Was Right."

Abraham Cahan was one of the most recognizable Jewish-American writers in both Yiddish and English. The Goldbergs began in 1929 as a radio comedy and drama about a Jewish-American family, and the show was initially targeted for Yiddish radio stations, but they made the leap first to CBS radio in 1936, and then to mass-market television in 1949, becoming a long-running situation comedy."

Robinson's own evaluation of Honest to God, found in his subsequent book Exploration into God (1967), stated that the chief contribution of this book was its successful synthesis of the work of seemingly opposed theologians Paul Tillich, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Rudolf Bultmann."

  "text" : "Hell and High Water: Global Warming — the Solution and the Politics — and What We Should Do is a book by author, scientist, and former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph J. Romm, published December 26, 2006. The author is \"one of the world's leading experts on clean energy, advanced vehicles, energy security, and greenhouse gas mitigation.\" The book warns of dire consequences to the U.S. and the world if wide-scale environmental changes are not enacted by the U.S. government within the next decade. It reviews the evidence that the current initial global warming changes will lead to accelerated warming. According to Romm, the oceans, soils, Arctic permafrost, and rainforests may become sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The book claims that, without serious government action within the next ten years, sea levels will rise high enough to submerge numerous coastal communities and inland areas on both U.S. coasts and around the world by the year 2100. In April 2008, TIME magazine wrote that \"On [Romm's] blog and in his most recent book, Hell and High Water, you can find some of the most cogent, memorable, and deployable arguments for immediate and overwhelming action to confront global warming.\" Romm was interviewed on Fox News on January 31, 2007 about the book and the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report climate report."

  "text" : "The book provides an uncommon perspective on the war as it is written by a well-educated, multi-lingual, Hungarian officer serving in multiple fronts. Though battles and combat feature throughout, the main focus is on the author's personal life. The war serves as a backdrop to a man of high birth in a society struggling to adapt to the modern world. The portrait provided of war on the eastern front is starkly different from that of the western front described in novels such as Le Feu (Under Fire). Antiquated militaria such as cavalry regiments are only eliminated near the end of the war period. The memoir presents a fairly positive view of the author's service. Written in a different time period, it could easily have passed for pro-war propaganda. Parts of the author's diary were used as such during the war period by the Hungarian government. For most of the novel, the view of the war is a positive one and the author's personal experiences harken back to the romantic and idealistic notions of war."

It features speculative technologies, including Specs and virtual server networks over mobile phones. The book is on its second printing in the United States. The novel was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 2008. The main story is split between three main protagonists, Sue, Elaine, and Jack, respectively, whose sections are always in the second person, with italicised thoughts in first person during each character's respective chapter. Each chapter is followed in sequential trilogies (Sue, Elaine, Jack) for the duration of the novel. This pattern excepts only the prologue and epilogue of the novel, which both contain faux email to supporting characters. A sequel to Halting State entitled Rule 34 (previously '419') was released in mid-2011."

  "text" : "How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found is a book by Doug Richmond, originally released in 1985, which is a how-to guide on starting a new identity. It includes chapters on planning a disappearance, arranging for new identification, finding work, establishing credit, pseudocide (creating the impression you are dead), and more. The book recommends a method of disappearing by assuming the identity of a dead person with similar vital statistics and age, and also includes a section on avoiding paper trails which, due to the age of the book, may no longer be relevant or useful. A play inspired by the book was released in 2005 by Fin Kennedy, about a man wanting to disappear, which won the John Whiting Award. Radiohead's song \"How To Disappear Completely\" off of their fourth album, Kid A, is named after this book and was originally going to be named after its full title."

  "text" : "Here Lies Arthur is a young-adult novel by Philip Reeve, published by Scholastic in 2007. Set in fifth or sixth century Britain and the Anglo-Saxon invasion, it features a girl who participates in the deliberate construction of legendary King Arthur during the man's lifetime, orchestrated by a bard. Reeve calls it a back-creation: not a genuine historical novel as it is not based on actual specific events; rather it is \"back-created\" from the legends, giving them a \"realistic\" origin. Reeve won the annual Carnegie Medal, recognising the year's best children's book published in the U.K. Scholastic published the first U.S. edition in November 2008."

The book includes over 500 black-and-white illustrations by Snow, originally executed in pen and ink. Although termed a book for young readers, it contains many of the elements of fantasy and adventure found in works such as those of Roald Dahl and J.K. Rowling that attract readers of all ages. The book has also been issued as a trilogy of shorter novels: Pants Ahoy!, The Man in the Iron Socks, and Cheese Galore!. These are subtitled Here Be Monsters Part 1, 2, and 3 (respectively). This should not be confused with the designation of the original single volume edition as being Volume I of \"The Ratbridge Chronicles.\""

  "text" : "How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (2001) is a memoir by Toby Young about his failed five-year effort to make it in the United States as a contributing editor at Condé Nast Publications' Vanity Fair magazine. The book alternates Young's foibles with his ruminations about the differences in culture and society between the United States and England, and specifically between New York City and London. The book depicts Young's relationship with various British and American journalists, including Julie Burchill, Anthony Haden-Guest, Tina Brown and Harold Evans (who at one point threaten to sue him) and Vanity Fair's own Graydon Carter. Young also describes awkward run-ins with American celebrities including Nathan Lane, Mel Gibson and Diana Ross. Throughout the book, Young describes being tormented by his friend \"Alex de Silva\" (speculated to be Sacha Gervasi), a former colleague of Young's who manages to succeed in America in every way that Young does not. The title of Young's book is a parody of the title of Dale Carnegie's 1937 perennial bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People; a parody by Irving Tressler titled How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was also published that same year. Young's book does not reference either Carnegie's or Tressler's works."

This dictionary still published by Hemkosh Printers is considered to be the Standard reference of the Assamese Language. Hemkosh is actually the second dictionary of Assamese language. The first Assamese dictionary was compiled by Dr. Miles Bronson, an American Baptist Missionary. His Dictionary, published in 1867 at American Baptist Mission Press Sibsagar, is out of print now. Bronson’s work did not pretend to be an etymological dictionary but contained a very considerable collection of words culled from the lips of the people but without derivations."

Fed up with his life in Shahkot, Sampath goes to a guava orchard and settles himself in a guava tree, where he uses the gossip he learned while working at the post office to convince people he is clairvoyant and soon becomes a popular \"holy man\". Kiran Desai based this book on a real-life story in which a man, Kapila Pradhan, lived up a tree for 15 years. This was the author's inspiration for the book and there are similarities between the novel and Pradhan's life in his tree."

It was first published in paperback by Ballantine Books as the twenty-ninth volume of its celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in April 1971. It was the second themed collection of Smith's works assembled by Carter for the series. The stories were originally published in various fantasy magazines from the 1930s to the 1950s, notably Weird Tales. The book collects one prose poem and ten tales of the author's Hyperborean cycle, set on a prehistoric lost northern continent Smith named for the mythological land of Hyperborea, with an introduction and map by Carter. One story from the sequence, the fragment \"The House of Haon-Dor,\" is omitted. The editor also includes in the collection four additional tales of Smith's from what he took to be a similar but more fragmentary sequence of stories."

Virtually unknown and only published in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \"The Call of Cthulhu\" and \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", both canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46."

  "text" : "Hollywood is the fifth historical novel in Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series. Published in 1990, it brings back the fictional Caroline Sanford, Blaise Sanford and James Burden Day and the real Theodore Roosevelt and William Randolph Hearst from Empire (the fourth novel in the series). Events are seen through the eyes of the Sanfords, Day, and the historical Jess Smith, a member of the Ohio Gang. Historical characters introduced in this novel include Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt and Warren G. Harding, as well early Hollywood figures such as Charlie Chaplin, Marion Davies, Elinor Glyn, Mabel Normand, and William Desmond Taylor, whose 1922 murder Vidal presents in fictionalized form. In the novel, Hearst and Caroline separately enter the movie business. Caroline becomes both a producer and, using a pseudonym, also performs as an actress. All this takes place while Wilson enters the U.S. into World War I and battles over the League of Nations, and Harding's subsequent attempts to return the country to \"Normalcy.\""

  "text" : "How Doctors Think is a book released in March 2007 by Jerome Groopman, the Dina and Raphael Recanati Chair of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, chief of experimental medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. The book opens with a discussion of a woman in her thirties who suffered daily stomach cramps and serious weight loss, and who visited some 30 doctors over a period of 15 years. Several misdiagnoses were made before she was finally found to have celiac disease. Groopman explains that no one can expect a physician to be infallible, as medicine is an uncertain science, and every doctor sometimes makes mistakes in diagnosis and treatment. But the frequency and seriousness of those mistakes can be reduced by \"understanding how a doctor thinks and how he or she can think better\". The book includes Groopman's own experiences both as an oncologist and as a patient, as well as interviews by Groopman of prominent physicians in the medical community. Notably, he describes his difficulties with a number of orthopedic surgeons as he sought treatment for a debilitating ligament laxity he suffered in his right hand, which over several years had led to the formation of cysts in the bones of his wrist."

All of the pictures in this book were taken by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was part of the team who did the trip (Pao also produced a book, Inside Himalaya, containing many more of his pictures). The book contains eight chapters: Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan (China), Nagaland and Assam(India), Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The book is presented in a diary format; Palin starts each section of the book with a heading such as \"Day Forty One: Srinagar\". Not all days are mentioned, a result of the trip as a whole being broken up into shorter trips (a fact that is not mentioned in the series). Palin makes several treks up into the mountains, including one trek up to Everest Base Camp at 17,500 feet (5,300 meters). Not bad, considering that Palin was 60 years old at the time. Other encounters and experiences that are related by Michael Palin include finding out that the Dalai Lama not only knew who he was, but was a fan of Palin's TV programmes."

During a stay in Tournehem, a castle near Saint-Omer, Erasmus encountered an uncivilized, yet friendly soldier who was an acquaintance of Battus, Erasmus' close friend. On the request of the soldier's pious wife, who felt slighted by her husband's behaviour, Battus asked Erasmus to write a text which would convince the soldier of the necessity of mending his ways, which he did. The resulting work was eventually re-drafted by Erasmus and expanded into the Enchiridion militis Christiani. The Enchiridion is an appeal on Christians to act in accordance with the Christian faith rather than merely performing the necessary rites. It became one of Erasmus' most influential works."

  "text" : "Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure is the book that Michael Palin wrote to accompany the BBC TV program Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure. This book, like the other books that Michael Palin wrote following each of his seven trips for the BBC, consists both of his text and of many photographs to illustrate the trip. All of the pictures in this book were taken by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was part of the team who did the trip. The idea behind this trip was to visit all of the places where Ernest Hemingway had lived and traveled and visited. Michael Palin tried also to meet some people who had known Hemingway, and to do some of the things Hemingway had done. The book contains eight chapters: Chicago/Michigan, Italy, Paris, Spain, Key West, Africa, Cuba, and American West. The material follows Ernest Hemingway's life in chronological order, except that some chapters, for example Africa, cover several visits to the same place at different times in Hemingway's life. (This is somewhat different from the associated TV program, which makes almost no attempt to follow Hemingway's life chronologically.) The book also contains a three-page Introduction, a two-page world map showing the far-flung locations associated with Hemingway, and a two-page tabular summary of Hemingway's life. Michael Palin starts the book by telling of his own introduction to Hemingway's writing, reading A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and The Old Man and the Sea when he was only 13. But a fascination with Hemingway's authorship is not necessary to appreciate this trip, as it can be simply considered to be an exciting trip following in the footsteps of an exciting person. The trip was done in 1999, 100 years after Hemingway's birth in 1899. The text of this book is available free to read online on Michael Palin's official web site."

Jessica was a supporter of Communism and eloped with her cousin to fight with the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War, and Diana grew up to marry Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists. Unity befriended Nazi leader Hitler, who praised her as an ideal of Aryan beauty. Mitford recalls: \"In the windows, still to be seen, are swastikas carved into the glass with a diamond ring, and for every swastika a carefully delineated hammer and sickle. They were put there by my sister Unity and myself when we were children. Hanging on the walls are framed pictures and poems done by Unity when she was quite small—queer, imaginative, interesting work, some on a tiny scale of microscopic detail, some huge and magnificent. The Hons' Cupboard, where Debo and I spent much of our time, still has the same distinctive, stuffy smell and enchanting promise of complete privacy from the Grown-ups.\" Hons and Rebels was originally published in the United States under the title Daughters and Rebels. Mitford and Hons and Rebels are cited by J.K. Rowling and Christopher Hitchens as great influences."

His adventures are usually in the company of his other animal friends who include the dachshund Schnitzel von Krumm, and belligerent solid grey tabby Scarface Claw. Written for pre-school children, with rhythmic, rhyming text, it has become a best-selling bedtime storybook in New Zealand and Australia. In this book, he is given a tasty bone from town butcher Samuel Stone and must get back to Donaldson's Dairy with it while fending off his five doggie chums - Hercules Morse the Great Dane, Muffin McLay the Old English Sheepdog, Bitzer Maloney the Greyhound, Bottomley Potts the Dalmatian and Schnitzel Von Krumm the Dachshund (with the very low tum)."

This novel was written by Amis during a two-year-long self-imposed exile in Uruguay following the release and tepid reception afforded to his 2003 novel Yellow Dog. The writing of House of Meetings \"precipitated (another) creative crisis\" for Amis, which Amis reflected upon in 2010: \"You see those Posy Simmonds cartoons of people by the pool having cocktails and saying into the Dictaphone, 'On the second day, the last child died,'\" he says. \"And I was in Uruguay, with my beautiful wife and beautiful daughters, living a completely stressless life. So I had to do my suffering on the page and, Christ, did I do it. I was very nervous about that book.\""

The book focuses on Holt's interactions with young children and his observations of children learning. From them, he attempts to make sense of how and why children do the things they do. The central thesis of his work is that children learn most effectively by their own motivation and on their own terms. He opposes teaching in general, believing that children find it just as patronizing as would an adult and that parents should provide information only as it is requested. Children learn best when they are not pressured to learn in a way that is of no interest to them. For example, the first thing all educators should do is evaluate the type of multiple intelligence possessed by students and use it to teach and assess them."

  "text" : "Hostile Waters (ISBN 0312966121) is a 1997 nonfiction book by Peter Huchthausen, Igor Kurdin and R. Alan White that describes the 1986 loss of the Soviet submarine K-219 off Bermuda. With a foreword by Tom Clancy, it begins with a note to the reader: The ordeal of the K-219 took place at the very height of the cold war.Much of its story is still shrouded in secrecy. Operations involving American submarines are simply not discussed by the United States Navy. Ironically, it proved easier to obtain information from the Russians. Events portrayed in this book reflect that difference. Acts taken by, conversations held between, even the private thoughts of the crew of the K-219 are taken directly from their testimony or from the submarine's log. Actions inside and maneuvers made by the American sub present at K-219's ordeal were reconstructed from Russian observations, American reports, interviews with many American naval officers and experts, and the author's long experience in naval affairs. Conversations and commands portrayed in the book may not be the actual words spoken, the commands sent, or the orders received. Like any intelligence analysis, the authors had to reconstruct this story from multiple sources. Sometimes they disagreed on the details. Their substance, however, is true. The paperback copy of the book featured black-and-white photos of the sub, the various men who served as the crew together with the authors. There are 18 Chapters and an Appendix with the K-219's complement along with an extensive bibliography."

  "text" : "How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization (also published as How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization) is a book written by American journalist Franklin Foer. It is an analysis of the interchange between soccer and the new global economy. The author takes readers on a journey from stadium to stadium around the globe in an attempt to shed new insights on today’s world events, both from political and economic standpoints. Soccer is here the globalized medium that seems to lend itself to explaining the effects globalization has on society as a whole."

  "text" : "How to Suppress Women's Writing is a book by Joanna Russ, published in 1983. Written in the style of a sarcastic and irreverent guidebook, it explains how women are prevented from producing written works, not given credit when such works are produced, or dismissed or belittled for those contributions they are acknowledged to have made. Although primarily focusing on texts written in English, the author also includes examples from non-English works and other media, like paintings. Citing authors and critics like Suzy McKee Charnas, Margaret Cavendish, and Vonda McIntyre, Russ aims to describe the systematic social forces that impede widespread recognition of the work of female authors. Although Russ was an active feminist and one of the central contributors to the feminist science fiction scene during the late 1960s and 70s, How to Suppress Women's Writing marked a transition towards her focus on literary criticism. In the same decade, she went on to write an essay entitled \"Recent Feminist Utopias,\" which was later published in 1995 as part of her book, To Write Like a Woman: Essays in Feminism and Science Fiction."

  "text" : "History by Contract is a book by early aviation researchers Major William J. O'Dwyer, U.S. Air Force Reserve (ret.) and Stella Randolph about aviation pioneer Gustave Whitehead. The book focuses on an agreement between the Smithsonian Institution and the estate of Orville Wright, which stipulates that the Smithsonian, as a condition of owning and displaying the 1903 Wright Flyer, must recognize and label it as the first heavier-than-air machine to make a manned, powered, controlled and sustained flight. The authors of the book offer evidence which they assert shows that the Smithsonian deliberately ignored Whitehead's aeronautical work in order not to violate the agreement with the Wright estate.The net result, they allege, made Whitehead a virtual nonentity in aviation history.\" They and other researchers argue that Whitehead made the first successful airplane flight in August 1901, predating the Wright brothers by more than two years. History By Contract reviews evidence and material available in two earlier books about Whitehead by Randolph and added statements and affidavits from self-described witnesses to Whitehead flights. O'Dwyer alleged that secrecy and denial by the Smithsonian kept the agreement with the Wright estate from public knowledge for years. He obtained a copy of the agreement in 1976 with help of then-Senator Lowell Weicker. The Smithsonian has said the agreement was put in place not to hide Whitehead's aviation experiments, but to prevent re-occurrence of a mistaken emphasis by the Smithsonian on the 1903 Langley Aerodrome, which the Institution wrongly identified for years as the first airplane \"capable\" of flight, even though it had not actually flown when Langley's workers tested it. The Smithsonian based its claim on test flights of the heavily modified Aerodrome in 1914 by Glenn Curtiss and his team."

Honoured Enemy is the first book written in the Legends of the Riftwar and is the only one of the series to be coauthored by William R. Forstchen. The story is set in the fantasy world of Midkemia, which is the world used for the majority of Raymond E. Feist's books. Honoured Enemy is written to coincide with the events in Feist's Riftwar Saga acting as a sidebar to the main action from the saga. It focuses on a group of elite soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, forced to ally with one, honourable, enemy to defeat a dishonourable enemy. The novel was explicitly written to have resonances with Bernard Cornwell's 'Sharpe' novels. It was first released by Harper Collins on August 6, 2001 in the United Kingdom. Roughly five years later Harper Collins released it into the US market."

  "text" : "History of the Loss of Vietnam (Chinese: 越南亡國史; pinyin: Yuènán Wángguó Shǐ, Vietnamese: Việt Nam vong quốc sử) was a Chinese-language book written by Phan Bội Châu, the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial revolutionary of the early 20th century, in 1905 while he was in Japan. It was published by Liang Chi Chao, a leading Chinese nationalist revolutionary scholar then in Japan, who assisted Chau during his time attempting to drum up support for Vietnamese independence in China. The book was intended for distribution mainly in China and abroad, but also for smuggling into Vietnam to rally people to the cause of Vietnamese independence. The book helped popularize the word \"Vietnam.\" At the time, the country was generally called \"Annam.\" The book negatively assessed the response of the Nguyen dynasty in the 19th century to the colonial challenges facing Vietnam and the failure to modernise, with the Nguyễn instead turning to ultra-orthodox conservative Confucianism. The book presents strident and emotive memorials to the key figures of the Cần Vương (Protect the King) movement of the late 1880s and early 1890s, led by mandarins such as Tôn Thất Thuyết and Phan Dinh Phung, who led guerrillas against the French. The Cần Vương attempted to overthrow the French rule and establish the boy emperor Hàm Nghi as ruler of an independent Vietnam. History analyzed French social and economic policies in Vietnam, which it regards as oppression. In the book, Chau argues for the establishment of a nationwide pro-independence front with seven factions or interested groups with a specific motivation to fight the French colonial authorities. The book was written in a style that differed from the prevailing writing technique and structure of the scholar gentry of the time. Chau eschewed this traditional style to write in a direct, ordinary prose style, especially in his analytical and argumentative sections. The book was distributed in China at least five times, and the first two printings were incorporated into Liang's periodical magazine Hsin-min ts'ung-pao. The book was accompanied by a foreword by Liang, which was used to draw similarities between the situation facing Vietnam and China with respect to foreign domination. The book created a reaction in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were taken aback by the Chau's description of the life that faced Vietnamese people under French rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer a similar fate if they failed to modernise. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Chau's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Chau did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book mainly had the effect of worrying Chinese about their own future. History had a much better reception among readers in Vietnam. Chau left Japan for the first time in August 1905, carrying fifty copies of the book that were distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country."

  "text" : "How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup is the fourth novel by J. L. Carr, published in 1975. The novel is a comic fantasy that describes in the form of an official history how a village football club progressed through the FA Cup to beat Glasgow Rangers F.C. in the final at Wembley Stadium. Like all of Carr's novels, it is grounded in his own experience. In 1930 as an unqualified 18-year-old teacher he played a season for South Milford White Rose when they won a football knockout tournament. It sold 2,124 copies. The novel has been dramatised several times by different playwrights. In 1991, it was adapted as a play for eight actors and was performed at the Worcester Swan Theatre, the Leatherhead Thorndike Theatre and the Mermaid Theatre, London where it ran for six weeks. More recently it was dramatised by Brian Wright for performance by an amateur youth theatre, with a cast of sixty, in Northamptonshire. The play was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2011 by one actor, Mark Jardine of Lichfield Garrick Theatre Repertory Company, who provided all the voices and characterisations. In this version the beaten finalists were Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.. Carr bought back the rights to the novel in 1992 and reprinted it in an edition of 2,000 copies as the fourth novel published by his own imprint, The Quince Tree Press."

  "text" : "Heathcliff Andrew \"Heath\" Ledger (4 April 1979 – 22 January 2008) was an Australian actor and director. After performing roles in Australian television and film during the 1990s, Ledger left for the United States in 1998 to develop his film career. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the latter two being posthumous. He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director. For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Posthumously he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I'm Not There, which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona. Ledger died on 22 January 2008 from an accidental intoxication from prescription drugs. A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received numerous posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he became the first actor to win an award posthumously), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor."

Virtually unknown and only published in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \"The Call of Cthulhu\" and \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", both canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46."

It is often a house, apartment, or other building, or alternatively a mobile home, houseboat, yurt or any other portable shelter. Homes typically provide areas and facilities for sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene. Larger groups may live in a nursing home, children's home, convent or any similar institution. A homestead also includes agricultural land and facilities for domesticated animals. Where more secure dwellings are not available, people may live in the informal and sometimes illegal shacks found in slums and shanty towns. More generally, \"home\" may be considered to be a geographic area, such as a town, village, suburb, city, or country. Transitory accommodation in a treatment facility for a few weeks is not normally considered permanent enough to replace a more stable location as 'home'. In 2005, 100 million people worldwide were estimated to be homeless."

They are the bootleggers, law-breakers, corrupt politicians, weak-kneed Protestant church members, white slavers, toe-kissers, wafer-worshippers, and every spineless character who takes the path of least resistance.\" She also argues that Catholics are removing the Bible from public schools. Another topic is her anti-Catholic stance towards the United States presidential election of 1928, in which Catholic Al Smith was running for president."

  "text" : "Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids is a non-fiction book by Maia Szalavitz analyzing the controversy surrounding the tough love behavior modification industry. The book was published February 16, 2006, by Riverhead Books. Szalavitz focuses on four programs: Straight, Incorporated, a copy of the Straight Inc. program called KIDS, North Star wilderness boot camp, and the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools. She discusses the background, history and methodology of the troubled-teen industry, including techniques drawn from attack therapy and Synanon. She uses first-person accounts and court testimony in her research, and states that no evidence exists proving that these programs are effective. The book also includes advice for parents and an appendix with additional resources on how to get responsible help for teenagers. The book received positive reviews in academic journals, literary journals, and in the media. Psychologist Steve K. D. Eichel reviewed the book for Cultic Studies Review and called it a \"must read\", psychologist and psychiatrist Robert John McAllister described it as \"an excellent and informative book on the subject of the 'troubled-teen industry' \" in his book Emotions: Mystery Or Madness, and a review in Psychology Today described Szalavitz's work as \"a meticulously reported and thoughtful investigation\". The book also received positive reviews in Publishers Weekly, Booklist, and Newsday. The book later led to an investigation into the troubled-teen industry by the United States House Committee on Education and Labor of the United States House of Representatives, and Representative George Miller held hearings on the matter in October 2007 and April 2008."

  "text" : "History of Shit (Histoire de la merde: Prologue) is a 1978 book by French psychoanalyst Dominique Laporte (1949–1984). It uses an idiosyncratic method of historical genealogy derived from, among others, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Georges Bataille, and Michel Foucault, to show how the development of sanitation techniques in Western Europe affected the formation of modern notions of individuality. Laporte examines this influence through the historical processes of urbanization, the apotheosis of nationalism, practices of capitalist exchange, and linguistic reform. In the English translation of the book by Nadia Benabid and Rodolphe el-Khoury in 1993, el-Khoury explains how for Laporte, \"the history of shit becomes the history of subjectivity\" and how his book becomes \"a prehistory to modernity and the modern subject\" (viii). el-Khoury identifies Laporte's scholarly strategy of joining the ridiculous and the profound as inherently political. Laporte's stated ambition is to \"remove a few masks with the roar of our laughter, laugh them off the figures of power\" (ix). In a previous work with Renée Balibar, Le Français national: politique et pratiques de la langue nationale sous la Revolution Française, Laporte studied language reforms carried out in the name of the French Revolution."

The book was released on September 8, 2008, by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The audiobook was released simultaneously by Macmillan Audio. The cover art is taken from Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights. Release 2.0 Updated and Expanded was published in November 2009."

  "text" : "Hollywood Undercover: Revealing the Sordid Secrets of Tinseltown is a non-fiction book about the culture of Hollywood society, written by investigative journalist and author Ian Halperin. Halperin poses as a gay man trying to become a successful actor in Hollywood, and informs individuals he is from the non-existent \"Israeli royal family\". He investigates rumors that the Church of Scientology reportedly claims to have a \"cure\" for homosexuality through \"auditing\", and speaks with a former Scientologist about his experiences. He also explores the casting couch phenomenon, the pornography industry, and the Oscars. Halperin meets with famous actors and celebrities, successfully obtains a talent agent, and a role in the film The Aviator. The book was published in 2007 in the United Kingdom by Mainstream Publishing, and on January 15, 2008 in the United States. Hollywood Undercover received generally positive reviews in The Herald, New York Daily News, The Saturday Star, and Contactmusic.com; and a critical review in The Independent. Halperin later released a documentary film on the same topic, His Highness Hollywood, which premiered in New York City in April 2008. His Highness Hollywood is a companion documentary to the book."

  "text" : "Hiding Place is a novel by the American writer John Edgar Wideman set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the 1970s. The novel tells the story of Tommy, a character who first appeared in Wideman's short story collection Damballah. Tommy is a party to a bungled smash-and-grab raid that leaves a dead man in a parking lot, so he hides out with Mother Bess, a crazy old woman who lives in Homewood, an African American neighborhood of the East End. Elements of the character Tommy parallel the life of Wideman's brother Robbie, whose story he relates in a memoir published three years later called Brothers and Keepers. Hiding Place is the middle volume of what some critics call The Homewood Trilogy. The other books are Damballah and Sent for You Yesterday. In 1992 the University of Pittsburgh Press published the three in one volume under the title The Homewood Books. In its preface Wideman admits discomfort with the term trilogy because it implies a plan of linking the volumes, and he claims he did not compose the books that way."

The book was a major element in the popular debate about the liberalisation of divorce law in the mid-1930s, and helped pave the way for the 1937 statutory reforms."

Mark and Handles won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Thus she became the third writer with two such honors (of seven through 2012), having won the 1976 Medal for her debut novel Thunder and Lightnings. Also set in the Norfolk countryside, it features two boys who love aeroplanes. Atheneum Books published the first U.S. edition in 1985, retaining the Parkins illustrations."

As a fourteen-year-old Jewish boy who had rarely ventured outside his small, remote village, Moyshe Rekhtman may seem an unlikely escape artist. But his iron will and quick wit allowed him to survive when all seemed lost. Staging escapes from death camps and avoiding Nazi pursuit through the frozen Ukrainian countryside-all while facing the loss of his family, famine, constant threat of capture, torture, and execution - would be a monumental task for the strongest of men. Despite his mild manners, emaciated body, and poor vision, he evaded the death squads in Nazi-occupied Ukraine for four years. Moyshe's Holocaust memoir is a remarkable example of human fortitude during a time when many welcomed an end to their suffering."

  "text" : "Harriet Said... was the first novel written by Beryl Bainbridge, based on newspaper reports the Parker–Hulme murder case in New Zealand which involved two young girls. Although completed in 1958 it was rejected by several publishers in the late fifties, one of whom wrote on the flyleaf of a first edition: what repulsive little creatures you have made the two central characters, repulsive almost beyond belief! And I think the scene in which the two men and the two girls meet in the Tsar's house is too indecent and unpleasant even for these lax days. What is more, I fear that even now a respectable printer would not print it!. The manuscript was thought lost but was found by one publisher, returned to the author and finally published by Duckworth in 1972, and by George Braziller in the US the following year."

The book was a bestseller in mainland China and made both Harvard and Liu Yiting household names among Chinese parents and students. It has since had numerous imitators, spawning an entire genre of how-to books on child-rearing for Chinese parents."

  "text" : "The Historical Atlas of World Mythology is a multi-volume series of books by Joseph Campbell that traces developments in humankind's mythological symbols and stories from pre-history forward. Campbell is perhaps best known as a comparativist who focused on universal themes and motifs in human culture. He first conceived of the Historical Atlas in the late 1970s as an extension of his works, The Mythic Image and The Masks of God. Like those books, the Historical Atlas of World Mythology intended to show the ways in which those universal themes and motifs were expressed differently by different cultures in different times and places. Heavily illustrated and annotated, with numerous charts and maps to show both variations and similarities in different cultures' expressions of mythic themes, this series was intended to serve both academic and lay readers. The Historical Atlas was left incomplete when Campbell died in 1987."

  "text" : "Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is historical fiction. It is a bestselling novel (2009) by Jamie Ford about the love and friendship between Henry Lee, a Chinese American boy, and Keiko Okabe, a Japanese American girl, during the internment in World War II. Henry meets a girl named Keiko. Soon, Henry and Keiko bond. The two become very close friends, even though both are bullied due to race. Henry feels a sense of filial piety to his parents. Although kind, Henry sneaks out one night and Keiko gives him her family pictures. Henry must protect these, before they are taken. He then travels with the lunch lady to work at Camp Harmony where he sees her. He follows her with his friend, a local jazz musician named Sheldon, to Minidoka, Idaho. Upon finding her there, he promises to wait for her. They decide to write each other letters until the war is over, and Henry returns to Seattle. He religiously mails Keiko letters, but receives very few in return. His father is intent on sending Henry to China, now that the Japanese are being pushed back, to finish his education traditionally. Henry arrives home one day to find a ticket to China in his name. He agrees to go on the condition that his father (as part of an association of elders) saves the Panama Hotel from being sold. The Panama Hotel is where Keiko's family stored the larger part of their belongings when they were shipped to the internment camps. Many other families also stored their possessions in the basement of the The Panama Hotel, which later became a National Historic Landmark and National Treasure."

  "text" : "Heaven and Earth: Global Warming – The Missing Science is a popular science book published in 2009 and written by Australian geologist, professor of mining geology at Adelaide University, and mining company director Ian Plimer. It disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, including the view that global warming is \"very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas concentrations\" and asserts that the debate is being driven by what the author regards as irrational and unscientific elements. The book received what The Age newspaper called \"glowing endorsements\" from the conservative press. The Australian said it gave \"all the scientific ammunition climate change skeptics could want.\" Other reviewers criticised the book as unscientific, inaccurate, based on obsolete research, and internally inconsistent. Ideas in it have been described as \"so wrong as to be laughable\". Heaven and Earth was a bestseller in Australia when published in May 2009, and is in its seventh printing, according to the publisher. The book has also been published in the United States and the United Kingdom."

  "text" : "How the Grinch Stole Christmas! is a children's story by Theodor \"Dr. Seuss\" Geisel written in rhymed verse with illustrations by the author. It follows the Grinch, a grouchy, solitary creature who attempts to put an end to Christmas by stealing Christmas-themed items from the homes of the nearby town Whoville on Christmas Eve. Despite his efforts, Whoville's inhabitants still celebrate the holiday, so the Grinch returns everything that he stole and is the guest of honor at the Whos' Christmas dinner. The story was published as a book by Random House in 1957, and at approximately the same time in an issue of Redbook. The book criticizes the commercialization of Christmas. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named it one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number 61 among the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" in a survey published by School Library Journal – the fourth of five Dr. Seuss books on the list. The book was adapted as a Christmas special twice, a 1966 animated TV movie starring Boris Karloff as both the narrator and the voice of the Grinch and a 2000 live-action feature film starring Jim Carrey."

Although Doctorow is unambiguous in identifying his fictional characters with the historical Collyer brothers, he changes many biographical facts in creating his story. Among the most overt are his extending the lives of the brothers by roughly thirty years into the late 1970s, reversing the birth order of the brothers, and making Homer, not Langley, the talented pianist."

The book examines the origins of the Scottish Enlightenment and what impact it had on the modern world. Following the Great Man approach, Herman focuses on individuals and presents their biographies in the context of their individual fields and also in terms of the theme of Scottish contributions to the world. The book was published as a hardcover in November 2001 by Crown Publishing Group and as a trade paperback in September 2002. Critics found the thesis to be over-reaching but descriptive of the Scots' disproportionate impact on modernity. In the American market, the trade paperback peaked at #3 on The Washington Post bestseller list, while in the Canadian market it peaked at #1."

  "text" : "Hominid is a short novel by Austrian writer Klaus Ebner. Taking place millions of years ago, it is a fictional story of a band of extinct hominids who inhabit Central Africa. Referencing the seven days of biblical Creation, the novel takes place in seven days. As the protagonist Pitar leads his band to civilization, tension arises between the clan leader Costello and his rival Re. Over the course of the story, Pitar invents tools, discovers the use of fire, and falls in love with Maluma. The seventh day marks a turning point in the storyline, as the members of the band separate from one another. The characters' contemporary language and Pitar's thorough knowledge of modern-day history, philosophy and science add to the grotesque humor of the novel, while his two friends quote classical Roman literature and Chinese sayings. The book was published by Viennese publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, several Austrian and German critics and writers published reviews of the novel."

  "text" : "The Handbook to the Birds of Australia is a two-volume work published in London in 1865 by the author John Gould. It was published in octavo format (250 x 170 mm), containing some 1290 pages, bound in green cloth with gilt lyrebirds on the front covers and with decorated gilt spines. The two volumes are separately paginated and include no illustrations It is essentially a revision and update of the text originally published with Gould’s monumental illustrated folio The Birds of Australia, which was published in seven volumes between 1840 and 1848. The author says in his Preface: ”Nearly twenty years have elapsed since my folio work on the Birds of Australia was completed. During that period many new species have been discovered, and much additional information acquired respecting those comprised therein; consequently it appeared to me that a careful résumé of the entire subject would be acceptable to the possessors of the former edition, as well as to the many persons in Australia who are now turning their attention to the ornithology of the country in which they are resident. Indeed I have been assured that such a work is greatly needed to enable the explorer during his journeyings, or the student in his quiet home, to identify the species that may come under his notice, and as a means by which the curators of the museums now established in the various colonies may arrange and name the collections intrusted to their charge. With these views the present Handbook has been prepared.” In 1972 Lansdowne Editions published a facsimile reprint of the Handbook, with the two volumes bound in one, including a foreword (“A Note on the Handbook”) by Allan McEvey, Curator of Birds at the National Museum of Victoria, as well as a biographical note on John Gould by John Currey. In his foreword McEvey says: \"The essential status of the Handbook emerges from its historical position; it looks back to the beginning of Australian ornithology, summarizing the known, and forward to the great Catalogue by Sharpe and others, and to the Australian works of Ramsay, Campbell, North and Mathews. From this transitional point it provides the present-day worker with an invaluable link between the early and the recent. Here will be found the familiar quote, (e.g. on the strength of Shrike-tit mandibles), the elusive reference, (e.g. an early note on the possible breaking of Emu’s eggs by the Buzzard), and many an easily over-looked observation (e.g. the remarks on the flight of the Owlet-nightjar). If one sees the text in historical perspective and reads critically (e.g. Gould’s comments on the nesting sites of pardalotes are inadequate) it may generally be said that the Handbook entry offers the best starting-point for the serious gathering of information on any particular Australian species.\"But in addition to the extraordinary amount of good observation it records, and to its plentiful snippets of ornithological and, indeed, Australian history, the Handbook offers pleasing samples of natural history prose of the nineteenth century which, verbose or not, reflect the dignity that the age expected of its science. It is true that Gould broadly speaking, was deaf to the song of Australian birds, but this probably shows the subjectiveness of nationality rather than a lack of appreciative ability. He was an Englishman, attuned to a mellow countryside and a seasonal bird-song, now in an arid land, looking – and listening – for ornithological differences. The Murray Scrub (mallee) was a far cry from Dorset, and 26 Charlotte Street; he heard little that stimulated nostalgic affection; and one does not become an Australian in two years But he was not insensitive and his various comments illustrate both his inevitable limitation and his response to the aesthetic.”"

  "text" : "Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (English: Brazilian Natural History), originally written in Latin, is the first scientific book about Brazil, written by Dutch naturalist Willem Piso and published in 1648. Piso makes use of observations made by the German naturalists Georg Marcgrave, and H. Gralitzio, in addition to John de Laet. It was dedicated to John Maurice, Count of Nassau. Though referring to Brazil throughout the text, the authors in fact write of the coastal strip of the Northeast, occupied by the East India Company.It is based on Piso's trip to Brazil in 1637 and offers an important early western insight into Brazilian flora and fauna by analysing plants and animals and studying tropical diseases and indigenous therapies. It was edited, as stated on its title page, in: Lugdun. Batavorum: Apud Franciscum Hackium ; et Amstelodami: Apud Lud. Elzevirium - Latin name of the prestigious Elsevier publisher, which still exists. The work consists of a single volume, originally measuring 40 centimetres (height) and its full title, with subtitle, is: \" Historia naturalis Brasiliae ...: in qua non tantum plantae et animalia, sed et indigenarum morbi, ingenia et mores describuntur et iconibus supra quingentas illustrantur  \". The Brazilian physician and researcher Juliano Moreira said of Piso's work:  'This clearly masterful work, when carefully reexamined, shows, at each perquisition, new excellences, and thus it is still one of the most authentic glories of Dutch medical literature. We owe to Pies a description, so accurate and meticulous, of the then reigning endemics in Brazil and the means of treating them. He observed the yaws, tetanus, various types of paralysis, dysentery, hemeralopia, maculopapular. He described Ipecac and emeto - cathartic qualities, which aboriginals used long before the famous doctor Adrian Helvetius, grandfather of the notable French philosopher Claudio Adriano Helvetius received from Louis XIV a thousand louis gold, titles and honors for having discovered exactly those same therapeutic virtues. The Treaty of Helvetius titled \"Remède contre le cours du ventre.\" dates from 1688'."

Profusely illustrated throughout, it is a valuable source of knowledge as to the appearance of Copenhagen in the middle of the 18th century. It compliments, with some overlap, de Thurah's other major work Den Danske Vitruvius, which focuses primarily on surrounding areas (such as Fredensborg), as well as the rest of Denmark. In 1967, Rosenkilde & Bagger published a facsimile edition, edited by Svend Cedergreen Bech."

  "text" : "How Doth the Simple Spelling Bee is a short story by Owen Wister that was published in book form in 1907. It is a satire about spelling reform efforts of the time, which also humorously and in a good-natured manner pokes fun at academia in general, and the folly of typical professors' endeavours. The story's protagonist is Chickle University professor Masticator B. Fellow, and is about his efforts to enlist the story narrator's support for spelling reform. Fellow advocates spelling all English words in a simpler, phonetic manner in order to make spelling easier for children and foreigners. Debates quickly ensue regarding whose pronunciation should be considered standard for phonetic spelling. The story then oddly changes track and focuses in on one couple who are attending the convention for spelling reform. This couple is much more interested in their blossoming romance than they are spelling reform. The narrator finds the woman of this couple attractive, attempts to woo her, and a love triangle ensues, forming some basis of suspense for the plot. The book ends with neither Fellow's attempts at spelling reform nor the narrator's attempts to win a woman's esteem proving the least bit successful."

  "text" : "Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina (in Spanish, History of Belgrano and of the Independence of Argentina) is an Argentine history book written by Bartolomé Mitre. It is mainly a biography of Manuel Belgrano, but the author expanded the scope into the whole Argentine War of Independence, where Belgrano was involved. It was the first book about the history of Argentina, and as such it was the starting point of the historiography of Argentina. It includes as well the autobiography of Manuel Belgrano, which was published by the first time in this book. When it was edited, the book generated controversies between the author and Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield and Juan Bautista Alberdi."

The semi-biographical book is based on two articles that appeared in both the online and print editions of the New York newspaper El Nuevo Cojo Ilustrado in 2004. The novel recounts the adventures of a young Venezuelan student in Paris, and his travels through the city's most distressed neighborhoods, Barbès and Château-Rouge. This work revealed a new facet in the author's writing: his ability to entertain and make the reader laugh. The text also takes the reader through the doubts and uncertainties experienced by a young man who wants to become a writer but do not have the faintest idea how. Furthermore, it documents, albeit non-intentionally, the experiments with moving images that eventually lead to the writing and production of short film called \"Permanence\". The edition published by Ediciones Idea had the support and contribution of Spanish photographer Tarek Ode, who gave one of his works for the cover and who presented the book in the Elder House of Tenerife in the company of the author."

  "text" : "Hidden in Plain Sight (Finnish: Piilottajan päiväkirja) is a non-fiction book by Juha Suoranta on helping a minor asylum seeker in Finland. The book, based on the author's journal, is about his attempt to protect Ashraf Sahil, and to help him avoid deportation to inhuman conditions. Sahil, who as a young child had fled with his family from Afghanistan to Pakistan in the 1990, was first sent to Iran from where he was carried to Greece through Turkey by human smugglers. From there he traveled across Europe to Finland in summer 2008. The Finnish Immigration officials  did not grant him a due asylum process but instead imposed a deportation when the author received an e-mail request for help from his sociologist friend in Minneapolis. Suoranta states that he could not tolerate a situation \"where a young person was about to be sent into an uncertain, perhaps life-threatening, situation. If it was in my power to do something, I had to do something.... Although I did not know what asylum, deportation, irregular immigration, or the Dublin agreement meant, it was necessary to try to do something, search for help, at least. When I found out that there was no organisation, including the church, which could help, I realised that I had a duty.\" Thus he hid the youngster to his late grandfather's apartment. The book has three storylines or intertwined layers. In one level it describes in a form of a journal the actual incidents in chronological order, a 5-month period from March to August 2009. In other level it ponders the author's inner feelings and anxieties in a difficult and unprecedented circumstances. And yet in another level the text contains ethical and moral reflections pertaining universal questions of helping another human beings referring, among others, to sociologist Zygmunt Bauman and philosopher Peter Singer, especially his Practical Ethics and The Life You Can Save. Suoranta's ethics in helping and hiding a stranger is as follows: \"Suffering and death because of the lack of basic needs or protection are unnecessary. And if they can be prevented without notable sacrifices, compared to suffering and death, it is wrong not to help.\" In Finland the book attracted publicity in newspapers, magazines and blogosphere as stories and book reviews; e.g. Helsingin Sanomat, the largest subscription newspaper in Finland, published a story in its Sunday pages titled \"Good Tamperenian\" in the eve of the book's publication."

  "text" : "Home and Away is an Australian television soap opera. It was created by Alan Bateman and commenced broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to Kangaroo Point, New South Wales, where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called Refuge, but the name was changed to the \"friendlier\" title of Home and Away once production began. The show premiered with a ninety-minute pilot episode (subsequently in re-runs known as Home and Away: The Movie). Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and Home and Away has become the second-longest drama series in Australian television. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm (on Thursdays, two episodes are played in a one-hour block). Home and Away follows the lives and loves of the residents in Summer Bay, a fictional seaside town of New South Wales. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family – Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa (Vanessa Downing), and their five foster children, Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) – who relocated from the city and moved into the Summer Bay House, where they took on the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). Home and Away was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol addiction and drug overdose. A storyline, in particular concerning rape outraged the public and a protest erupted, as viewers deemed it an inappropriate subject to be covering in an early evening time slot. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its restricted time slot. Palm Beach in Sydney's Northern Beaches district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern. Home and Away has been sold to over eighty countries around the world, making it one of Australia's successful media exports. It is popular in the United Kingdom, and is one of the highest-rating shows on RTÉ Television in Ireland and TV2 in New Zealand. In Australia, Home and Away is the most awarded program at the Logie Awards, with a total of forty-six wins, including Best Drama Program. Some cast members have won several other awards such as the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television, Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor, and Most Popular Actress. In 2015, Home and Away was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame."

Collins went on to pen several more \"Hollywood\" titled books, including Hollywood Kids (1994), Hollywood Wives: The New Generation (2001), and Hollywood Divorces (2003). Although these further novels tend to be separate works rather than direct sequels, characters from the original Hollywood Wives have made brief appearances in the other novels."

  "text" : "HHhH is the debut novel of French author Laurent Binet. It recounts Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Nazi leader Reinhard Heydrich in Prague during World War II. It was awarded the 2010 Prix Goncourt du Premier Roman. The novel follows the history of the operation and the life of its protagonists – Heydrich and his assassins Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. But it is also interlaced with the author's account of the process of researching and writing the book, his commentary about other literary and media treatments of the subject, and reflections about the extent to which the behavior of real people may of necessity be fictionalised in a historical novel. The title is an acronym for Himmlers Hirn heißt Heydrich (\"Himmler's brain is called Heydrich\"), a quip about Heydrich said to have circulated in Nazi Germany. The title was suggested by Binet's publisher, Grasset, instead of the \"too sci-fi\" working title Opération Anthropoïde. The editor also requested the cut of about twenty pages criticizing Jonathan Littell's Les Bienveillantes, another novel about the SS in World War II that was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 2006. The Millions published the \"missing pages\" in 2012."

  "text" : "Hellenic Nomarchy (Greek: Ελληνική Νομαρχία The Greek rule of law) was a pamphlet written by \"Anonymous the Greek\" published and printed in Italy in 1806. It advocated the ideals of freedom, social justice and equality as the main principles of a well-governed society, making it the most important theoretical monument of Greek republicanism. Its author, arguing for both social autonomy and national sovereignty, supported the Greek struggle for national liberation and turned to the moral greatness of ancient Greece in order to stimulate collective pride. Although this work was widely read by Greeks before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, from its first appearance it was received with discomfort by contemporary scholars, and generated debates on the identity of its author."

Parts of Chapters II, III, IV and VIII were adapted from Knight's story \"Turncoat\", which appeared in the April 1953 Thrilling Wonder Stories.

O'Rourke uses wit to recount family travel to various tourist destinations. It is loosely modeled after his earlier book Holidays in Hell. In the introduction, O'Rourke says, \"[After my experiences as a war correspondent] I decided to write about pleasant places. ... I'd always been where people were shooting each other ... How, I wondered, does one undertake enjoyably going somewhere enjoyable?\""

The majority of the portraits were first painted in oil by artist Charles Bird King. McKenney was working as the US Superintendent of Indian Trade and would head the Office of Indian Affairs, both then within the War Department. He planned publication of the biographical project to be supported by private subscription, as was typical for publishing of the time. Believing that Native Americans were threatened as a race, McKenney wanted to preserve a record of their leaders for government archives, as well as to share it with the American people. He commissioned Charles Bird King to paint portraits of leaders who came to Washington to negotiate treaties, and James Hall to write biographies of them. The publication project incorporated lithographs made from the paintings."

It is the first complete and definitive account of how the most notorious Nazi war criminals escaped justice at the end of World War II and managed to live normal lives as fugitives all the while many of their peers were pursued and captured. The book is based on new interviews with an array of individuals including Nazi hunters as well as former Nazis and intelligence agents. It traces back the actual escape routes, based on archival documents in Germany, Britain, the United States, Austria, and Italy. It also debunks much of the legend of the ODESSA network in the postwar era."

  "text" : "Homosexuality (from ancient Greek  ὁμός, meaning \"same\", and Latin  sexus, meaning \"sex\") is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to people of the same sex. It \"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.\" Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural, scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation. The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, though gay is also used to refer generally to both homosexual males and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay or lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to homophobia and heterosexist discrimination. Homosexual behavior has also been documented and is observed in many non-human animal species. Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration. These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards increased visibility, recognition, and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, equal access to health care, and the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay minors."

  "text" : "Heathen Gods in Old English Literature is a historical study of the literary references for several pagan deities in Anglo-Saxon England. Written by the English studies scholar Richard North of University College London, it was first published by Cambridge University Press in 1997. The book was released as the twenty-second monograph in the Press' series, \"Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England\", edited by Simon Keynes, Michael Lapidge and Andy Orchard. Prior to the book's publication, North had previously authored other studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as Pagan Words and Christian Meanings (1991). Heathen Gods in Old English Literature details North's theory that the god Ing played a prominent role in the pre-Christian religion of Anglo-Saxon England, and highlights references to him in such texts as Beowulf and the sole surviving Anglo-Saxon copy of the Book of Exodus. The book received a mixed reviewed in peer reviewed journals such as The Modern Language Review. Critics argued that North's interpretations of the evidence were too speculative."

  "text" : "Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization is a 2008 book by Nicholson Baker about World War II. The book questions the commonly held belief that the Allies wanted to avoid the war at all costs but were forced into action by Hitler's unrelenting crusade. It consists largely of official government transcripts, newspaper articles and other documents from the time with Baker interjecting commentary only occasionally. Baker cites documents that suggest that the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom were provoking Germany and Japan into war and that the leaders of those two nations had ulterior motives for participating. Baker dedicates the book to American and British pacifists of the time who, in the book's epilogue, he states had it right all along: “They failed, but they were right.”"

It is a fictionalised account of the life of the philosopher Hypatia, and tells the story of a young monk called Philammon who travels to Alexandria, where he becomes mixed up in the political and religious battles of the day. Although intended as Christian apologia, the novel has a deliberate anti-Catholic tone, and it also reflects Kingsley's other prejudices about race and religion, many of which were typical to the 19th century. For many years the book was considered one of Kingsley's best novels and was widely read."

The book contains 250 photos and 12 technical diagrams, some of which were previously classified. Research on the book began while Kuran was working as an animator for Star Wars. He was able to interview and collect material from photographers who witnessed the blasts, whom he calls unrecognized patriots. A traveling exhibit based on the book was purchased by the Atomic Testing Museum and put on display in 2007. In 2010, The New York Times featured a 23-image slideshow on its website with photos taken from the book accompanied by an audio recording of George Yoshitake, then one of the few surviving cameramen."

  "text" : "Homosexuality (from ancient Greek  ὁμός, meaning \"same\", and Latin  sexus, meaning \"sex\") is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to people of the same sex. It \"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.\" Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural, scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation. The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, though gay is also used to refer generally to both homosexual males and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay or lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to homophobia and heterosexist discrimination. Homosexual behavior has also been documented and is observed in many non-human animal species. Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration. These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards increased visibility, recognition, and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, equal access to health care, and the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay minors."

It was compiled by the Royal Historical Commission between 1829 and 1832. The compilation was based on several existing chronicles and local histories, and the inscriptions collected on the orders of King Bodawpaya, as well as several types of poetry describing epics of kings. Although the compilers disputed some of the earlier accounts, they by and large retained the accounts given Maha Yazawin, the standard chronicle of Toungoo Dynasty. The chronicle, which covers events right up to 1821, right before the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826), was not written purely from a secular history perspective but rather to provide \"legitimation according to religious criteria\" of the monarchy. Indeed, the \"most important development\" in Hmannan was the replacement of the hitherto prevalent pre-Buddhist origin story of Burmese monarchy with one that links the origins of the monarchy to the clan of the Buddha and the first king of Buddhist mythology, Maha Sammata. Hmannan was the main chronicle referenced by early European scholars to write the earliest versions of Burmese history, and it still is the main standard chronicle in the study of Burmese history."

Goldman later recalled: I didn't know that I was going to write the damn thing. My wife had left me. I got the Cannes Film Festival invitation while we were still together and then she left and Rob Reiner said, 'I am on a personal campaign to get you accepted on the Miss America Contest'. I began keeping notes because I thought it was something that could be an interesting little book... No, it was not my attempt to woo back my wife. She was wonderful and we're still friends and talk all the time. Nobody in my family ever said, 'God, how could you have trivialised your divorce or your marriage by writing that book?' Looking back on the book twenty years later Goldman reflected that Miss America contest no longer had the same appeal for people. \"I'm stunned at the fact that the Miss America contest has disappeared as a piece of popular culture. It just shocks me.\""

Culminating in his wife, she delivers a long monologue, and Hind then obsessively tries to reverse the hunt.

  "text" : "How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed is a non-fiction book about brains, both human and artificial, by the inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. First published in hardcover on November 13, 2012 by Viking Press it became a New York Times Best Seller. It has received attention from The Washington Post, The New York Times and The New Yorker. Kurzweil describes a series of thought experiments which suggest to him that the brain contains a hierarchy of pattern recognizers. Based on this he introduces his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind. He says the neocortex contains 300 million very general pattern recognition circuits and argues that they are responsible for most aspects of human thought. He also suggests that the brain is a \"recursive probabilistic fractal\" whose line of code is represented within the 30-100 million bytes of compressed code in the genome. Kurzweil then explains that a computer version of this design could be used to create an artificial intelligence more capable than the human brain. It would employ techniques such as hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms, strategies Kurzweil used successfully in his years as a commercial developer of speech recognition software. Artificial brains will require massive computational power, so Kurzweil reviews his law of accelerating returns which explains how the compounding effects of exponential growth will deliver the necessary hardware in only a few decades. Critics felt the subtitle of the book, The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, overpromises. Some protested that pattern recognition does not explain the \"depth and nuance\" of mind including elements like emotion and imagination. Others felt Kurzweil's ideas might be right, but they are not original, pointing to existing work as far back as the 1980s. Yet critics admire Kurzweil's \"impressive track record\" and say that his writing is \"refreshingly clear\", containing \"lucid discussions\" of computing history."

It is a maritime operations guidance book, but also attracted some attention due to its title, which some found to be unusual, incongruous, and humorous. Intended for a specialized audience (the captains or operators of small private boats (such as yachts and trawlers)), the book gives advice on appropriate avoidance actions when confronted by the near presence of a large ship such as a freighter, along with anecdotes and background information such as the capabilities and operating procedures of the large ships."

  "text" : "Hanthawaddy Hsinbyushin Ayedawbon (Burmese: ဟံသာဝတီ ဆင်ဖြူရှင် အရေးတော်ပုံ) is a 16th-century Burmese chronicle of King Bayinnaung of Toungoo Dynasty. Though it is a biographic chronicle, it is a detailed account of the reign. The detailed coverage begins in 1550, right after the death of King Tabinshwehti, and ends in 1579, two years before the end of the reign. The chronicle was commissioned by the king's eldest son Nanda and brothers Minkhaung II of Toungoo, Thado Dhamma Yaza II of Prome and Thado Minsaw of Ava in 1564. It was compiled by Yazataman, a senior minister at Bayinnaung's court. He was a cavalry regiment commander, and served in several military campaigns under kings Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung. He also served at Bayinnaung's successor Nanda's court. The author mentions that he compiled the chronicle using contemporary sources and some inscriptions, and that he considered 235 records of notable events that took place during the reign and selected 35 major events from the list. Most of the selected events are military campaigns, and are covered in detail. A few non-military events covered are the building of a new palace and a new royal capital, the construction of four pagodas in the four corners of the capital Pegu, and the conferring of the kingship of Lan Na to his son Nawrahta Minsaw. It also provides accounts of the king's efforts to propagate Theravada Buddhism, the construction and repairing of pagodas, the banning of animal and human sacrifices in the new conquered Shan States, and the standardization of weights and measures in his empire. The oldest extant palm-leaf manuscript copy of the original, copied on 4 January 1672 (5th waxing of Pyatho 1033 ME), is stored at the Universities Historical Research Center in Yangon. The next oldest copy is a mimeographed copy made in 1839 of an existing manuscript."

Despite the name Hsinbyushin, it is not the chronicle of Bodawpaya's famous brother King Hsinbyushin. The chronicle covers the early reign up to 1786, and consists of 74 palm leaves with 12 lines to a leaf. It provides a detailed account of how the new capital of Amarapura was built, the 1784–1785 Arakan campaign under Crown Prince Thado Minsaw, and how the Mahamuni Buddha was brought back to Amarapura. Moreover, it includes the palace customs, including how royal appurtenances were arranged, court dresses, etc., which are not found in the main chronicles."

  "text" : "The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р, \"Extermination by hunger\" or \"Hunger-extermination\"; derived from морити голодом, \"to kill by starvation\"), also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine, and—prior to the widespread use of the term \"Holodomor,\" as well as currently still—referred to also as the Great Famine, and The Ukrainian Genocide of 1932-33 was a man-made famine in Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed an estimated 2.5–7.5 million Ukrainians, with millions more counted in demographic estimates. It was part of the wider disaster, the Soviet famine of 1932–33, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. During the Holodomor millions of citizens of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine. Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by the independent Ukraine and 24 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet Union. Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials varied greatly; anywhere from 1.8 to 12 million ethnic Ukrainians were said to have perished as a result of the famine. Recent research has since narrowed the estimates to between 2.4 and 7.5 million. The exact number of deaths is hard to determine, due to a lack of records, but the number increases significantly when the deaths inside heavily Ukrainian-populated Kuban are included. Older estimates are still often cited in political commentary. According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kyiv in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficit. Some scholars believe that the famine was planned by Joseph Stalin to eliminate the Ukrainian independence movement. Using Holodomor in reference to the famine emphasizes its man-made aspects, arguing that actions such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs, and restriction of population movement confer intent, defining the famine as genocide; the loss of life has been compared to the Holocaust. If Soviet policies and actions were conclusively documented as intending to eradicate the rise of Ukrainian nationalism, they would fall under the legal definition of genocide. The debate among historians is ongoing and there is no international consensus among scholars or governments on whether the Soviet policies that caused the famine fall under the legal definition of genocide."

  "text" : "How to Start a Business in Taiwan is a 2013 book by Elias Ek, a Swedish entrepreneur and writer. The book covers the main areas of information that a foreigner living in Taiwan who wants to set up a business or invest in a Taiwanese business needs to know. Launched during the 2013 Taipei International Book Exhibition (Jan 30-Feb 4, 2013) the book was very well received by both customers and society. The very first copy was handed over to Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) who said he hoped the book would help bring more foreign investors to Taiwan. Author Elias Ek says the book is not about how to start a successful business but how to successfully start a business in Taiwan. This book covers Taiwan-specific issues like: \n*  - An introduction to doing business in Taiwan \n*  - A guide to doing business in Taiwan \n*  - Staffing your business in Taiwan \n*  - Picking the correct business entity \n*  - Registering your business \n*  - Financing your business in Taiwan \n*  - Overview of the legal systems, trademarks and patents \n*  - Interviews with successful foreign entrepreneurs in Taiwan Ek says his ambition in writing the book is \"that when you hire an accountant to do the paperwork, you know the questions to ask. You would be able to point to a Chinese term and say: ’Is that what you are talking about?’ So you can get on the same page easier. My second ambition is that you could also do the whole process on your own.\" The well read blog InTaiwan.de recommended the book but suggested the section about pensions was utterly confusing and some chapters were out of order. The government-sponsored 100 Innovators show on radio station Uni FM interviewed Ek and the journalist Lilian Kim called Ek one of Taiwan's most successful foreign entrepreneurs."

  "text" : "In music, harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches (tones, notes), or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the \"vertical\" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the \"horizontal\" aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony. In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) \"resolves\" to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments."

Montgomery argues that the happy city, the green city, and the low-carbon city are the same place, and we can all help build it.

  "text" : "Homosexuality (from ancient Greek  ὁμός, meaning \"same\", and Latin  sexus, meaning \"sex\") is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to people of the same sex. It \"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.\" Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural, scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation. The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, though gay is also used to refer generally to both homosexual males and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay or lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to homophobia and heterosexist discrimination. Homosexual behavior has also been documented and is observed in many non-human animal species. Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration. These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards increased visibility, recognition, and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, equal access to health care, and the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay minors."

Most of the book is based on articles he published under the pseudonym \"Spengler\" on the Asia Times newspaper."

  "text" : "Hitler's Thirty Days to Power is a 1996 history book by historian and Yale professor Henry Ashby Turner. The book covers political events in Germany during the month of January 1933, which culminated in the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor on January 30. In Hitler's Thirty Days to Power, Turner concludes that Hitler's rise was not inevitable, but that the end of the Weimar democracy probably was: Turner speculates that by 1933 the likely alternative to Hitler was a Kurt von Schleicher-led military regime, which Turner believes would have confined its territorial ambitions to the recovery of the Polish Corridor, leading to a limited German-Polish conflict but not a general European war – an unfolding of events where, in Mark Grimsley's characterization of Turner's conclusions, \"Adolf Hitler would have become a mere footnote in history\". The book was reviewed by many important publications, including Foreign Affairs (by Stanley Hoffmann), The Times Literary Supplement, Booklist, The New York Review of Books (by Gordon A. Craig), Kirkus Reviews, History and Theory and other publications. Historian and Hitler biographer Alan Bullock called Hitler's Thirty Days to Power \"[T]he best and fullest account of the 'make or break' month of January 1933\"."

  "text" : "Theophrastus's Enquiry into Plants or Historia Plantarum (Greek: Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία, Peri phyton historia) was, along with his mentor Aristotle's History of Animals, Pliny the Elder's Natural History and Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, one of the most important books of natural history written in ancient times, and like them it was influential in the Renaissance. Theophrastus looks at plant structure, reproduction and growth; the varieties of plant around the world; wood; wild and cultivated plants; and their uses. Book 9 in particular, on the medicinal uses of plants, is one of the first herbals, describing juices, gums and resins extracted from plants, and how to gather them. Historia Plantarum was written some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus described plants by their uses, and attempted a biological classification based on how plants reproduced, a first in the history of botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be read as a book. Historia Plantarum was first translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza; the translation was published in 1483. Johannes Bodaeus published a frequently cited folio edition in Amsterdam in 1644, complete with commentaries and woodcut illustrations. The first English translation was made by Sir Arthur Hort and published in 1916."

  "text" : "Hard Choices is a memoir of former United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, published by Simon & Schuster in 2014, giving her account of her tenure in that position from 2009 to 2013. It also discusses some personal aspects of her life and career, including her feelings towards President Barack Obama following her 2008 presidential campaign loss to him. It is generally supportive of decisions made by the Obama administration. The book was promoted partly in light of the possibility of a Clinton bid in the 2016 presidential election. Excerpts from the book were released in advance of its publication. Clinton staged an extensive promotional tour for the book, which had the air of a political campaign with groups both for and against her appearing at book-signing events. Hard Choices became number one on the New York Times Best Seller List, but sold considerably less than her 2003 memoir, Living History. Interpreting what sales of the book meant for her possible political future became a subject for discussion among interested parties."

  "text" : "Hotel Acropolis is a 1929 novel by the French writer Pierre Drieu La Rochelle. The French title is Une femme à sa fenêtre, which means \"a woman at her window\". The narrative is set in Athens and revolves the love affair between the wife of a French diplomat and a young communist leader who is sought by the police for a terrorist attack he has committed. Drieu was himself a communist at the time he wrote the novel, but the communist character is portrayed as a man who seeks adventure and action rather than a Marxist hero. This kind of character, the political adventure seeker, here appears for the first time in the author's oeuvre, and would be used several times in his subsequent works. The novel first appeared in the left-wing weekly La Voix in 1929 and was published as a book by Éditions Gallimard the same year. An English translation by Patrick Kirwan was published in 1931. The book was adapted into the 1976 film A Woman at Her Window directed by Pierre Granier-Deferre."

This is Bhagat's sixth novel which was released on 1 October 2014 by Rupa Publications. The novel has also been published in Hindi and Gujarati versions as well. A Bollywood film adaptation is planned. Dedicated to \"non English-types\", as Chetan Bhagat wrote, the book divulges the sentiments and linguistic struggles of a backward rural Bhojpuri-laced Hindi-speaking boy from Bihar as he enrolls himself at the prestigious English-medium St. Stephen’s College, New Delhi, and falls in love with a \"high class English-speaking rich Delhi girl\" schooled at Modern School (New Delhi), New Delhi. The girl does not admit the relationship but agrees to be his \"half girlfriend\". Chetan Bhagat commented, \"Half-Girlfriend, to me, is a unique Indian phenomenon, where boys and girls are not clear about their relationship status with each other. A boy may think he is more than friends with the girl, but the girl is still not his girlfriend. Hence, I thought we needed a term like 'Half girlfriend'. Because, in India, that is what most men get.\""

When the book begins, Cuckoo is living with a foster mother after her own mother abandoned her, an incident that caused Cuckoo to have a brief stay at a mental institution. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Patterson said of the book, “I think that this book is my closest yet to the kind of book I always thought I’d write when I began writing ... It has some fantasy, humor, and is very human. Some heavy things happen to the kids in the book, things that happen in real life.\" Homeroom Diaries has received positive reviews from critics. Publishers Weekly said, \"Patterson brings the misfit theme of Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life and its sequels into edgier territory\" and book blogger Miss Literati said, \"Patterson has managed to write a novel that tells a honest, fun, highly entertaining read.\""

  "text" : "Hanns and Rudolf is a dual biography of Hanns Alexander and Rudolf Höss by the British-American journalist Thomas Harding. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the first British War Crimes Investigation Team is assembled to hunt down the senior Nazi officials responsible for the greatest atrocities the world has ever seen. One of the lead investigators is Lieutenant Hanns Alexander, a German Jew who is now serving in the British Army. Rudolf Höss is his most elusive target. As Kommandant of Auschwitz, Höss not only oversaw the murder of more than one million men, women, and children; he was the man who perfected Hitler’s program of mass extermination. Höss is on the run across a continent in ruins, the one man whose testimony can ensure justice at Nuremberg. The book received favourable reviews from a variety of authors in the thriller genre. John Le Carré called it \"'A gripping thriller, an unspeakable crime, an essential history, a scrupulously dispassionate narrator.' Equally, Frederick Forsyth described it as \"'An extraordinary tale deriving from meticulous research – the story of how a Jew after 1945 almost single-handedly hunted down the Kommandant of Auschwitz.\" It also received praised from historians. Ben Macintyre wrote: \"Meticulously researched and deeply felt, Hanns and Rudolf is written with a suppressed fury at the vicious moral emptiness of men like Höss, who were only following orders.\" Max Hastings said \"Fascinating and moving... This is a remarkable book, which deserves a wide readership.\" Hanns and Rudolf was a The Sunday Times bestseller in hardback and paperback in the UK, and a bestseller in Israel and Italy. It has been translated into more than eighteen languages. In May 2014 it was announced that Hanns and Rudolf had been optioned by The Ink Factory Films and that the company is in talks with Sir Ronald Harwood to adapt the book."

While it is not fantasy as are most of Eddings' other books, it still shares similarities with most of them as the book focuses on the main character maturing, falling in love, and overcoming personal tragedy. The story is written from the first person perspective though the eyes of Dan Alders, a soldier back from the Vietnam War and on a hunting trip with his estranged brother Jack and some \"friends\": Cal, Lou, and Stan. During the hunt, tensions and old hatreds rise and escalate into open fighting. The story takes place in the Cascade Mountains, in Washington state U.S."

History and Class Consciousness, which helped to create Western Marxism, is the book for which Lukács is best known, and some of his pronouncements have become famous. Nevertheless, History and Class Consciousness was condemned in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and Lukács later repudiated its ideas, and came to believe that in it he had confused Hegel's concept of alienation with that of Marx. It has been suggested that the concept of reification as employed in Martin Heidegger's Being and Time (1927) shows the strong influence of History and Class Consciousness, though such a relationship remains disputed."

  "text" : "Henry and Cato is a novel by Iris Murdoch. Published in 1976, it was her eighteenth novel. Set in London and the English countryside, the plot centres on two childhood friends who have not seen each other for several years. Henry is an art historian who returns to England from the United States upon inheriting his family estate, and Cato is a Roman Catholic priest who is losing his faith and has secretly fallen in love with a seventeen-year-old boy . Their stories, separate at the beginning of the novel, converge as it progresses. The complex story is supported by formal plot symmetries and doubleness is an important theme throughout. The plot, which involves a violent kidnapping, has elements of the thriller genre. The book was generally favourably received by contemporary reviewers."
