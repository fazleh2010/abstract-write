  "text" : "The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is a descriptive dictionary of the English language, published by the Oxford University Press. It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world. The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989. Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society. In 1895, the title The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, the title The Oxford English Dictionary fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published. Since 2000, a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately a third of which is now complete. The first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will probably only appear in electronic form; Nigel Portwood, chief executive of Oxford University Press, feels it unlikely that it will ever be printed."

  "text" : "On the Origin of Species (or more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream. The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T. H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences."

Published in 1937, it tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers, who move from place to place in California in search of new job opportunities during the Great Depression in the United States. Based on Steinbeck's own experiences as a bindlestiff in the 1920s (before the arrival of the Okies he would vividly describe in The Grapes of Wrath), the title is taken from Robert Burns' poem \"To a Mouse\", which read: \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley\". (The best laid schemes of mice and men / Often go awry.) Required reading in many schools, Of Mice and Men has been a frequent target of censors for vulgarity and what some consider offensive and racist language; consequently, it appears on the American Library Association's list of the Most Challenged Books of 21st Century."

In 2010, Scribner republished the memoir as a 10th anniversary edition, which featured an updated reading list from King. On Writing is organized into five sections: \"C.V.\", in which King highlights events in his life that influenced his writing career; \"What Writing Is\", in which King urges the reader to take writing seriously; \"Toolbox\", which discusses English mechanics; \"On Writing\", in which King details his advice to aspiring writers; and \"On Living: A Postscript\", in which King describes his van accident and how it affected his life. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly included On Writing on their \"The New Classics: Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008\" list. Both Sharon Johnson in The Patriot-News and Julie Woo for the Associated Press, in separate reviews, praised King's advice as \"solid\". John Mark Eberhart, writing in the Sunday Free Lance-Star, called King's writing advice \"pedestrian\", but ultimately concluded that On Writing was \"a slight but transitionally important work that should lead [King] to better things.\""

  "text" : "Other Losses is a 1989 book by Canadian writer James Bacque, in which Bacque alleges that U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower intentionally caused the deaths by starvation or exposure of around a million German prisoners of war held in Western internment camps briefly after the Second World War. Other Losses charges that hundreds of thousands of German prisoners that had fled the Eastern front were designated as \"Disarmed Enemy Forces\" in order to avoid recognition under the third Geneva Convention, for the purpose of carrying out their deaths through disease or slow starvation. Other Losses cites documents in the U.S. National Archives and interviews with people who stated they witnessed the events. The book claims that there was a \"method of genocide\" in the banning of Red Cross inspectors, the returning of food aid, the policy regarding shelter building, and soldier ration policy. Stephen Ambrose, a historian Eisenhower had enlisted in his efforts to preserve his legacy and counteract criticisms of his presidency, and seven other historians examined the book soon after its publication, and came to the conclusion that it was inaccurate and the product of conspiracy theory. Other historians, including the former senior historian of the United States Army Center of Military History, Colonel Ernest F. Fisher, who was involved in the 1945 investigations into the allegations of misconduct by U.S. troops in Germany and who wrote the book's foreword, argues that the claims are accurate."

As the radiation approaches, each person deals with impending death differently. Shute's initial story appeared as a four-part series, The Last Days on Earth, in the London weekly periodical Sunday Graphic in April 1957. For the novel, Shute expanded on the storyline. The story has been adapted twice as a film (in 1959 and 2000) and once as a BBC radio broadcast in 2008."

The story is of the orphan Oliver Twist, who starts his life in a workhouse and is then sold into apprenticeship with an undertaker. He escapes from there and travels to London, where he meets the Artful Dodger, a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal, Fagin. Oliver Twist is notable for its unromantic portrayal by Dickens of criminals and their sordid lives, as well as for exposing the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century. The alternate title, The Parish Boy's Progress, alludes to Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, as well as the 18th-century caricature series by William Hogarth, A Rake's Progress and A Harlot's Progress. In this early example of the social novel, Dickens satirizes the hypocrisies of his time, including child labour, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens's own youthful experiences contributed as well. Oliver Twist has been the subject of numerous adaptations for various media, including a highly successful musical play, Oliver!, and the multiple Academy Award-winning 1968 motion picture."

  "text" : "Our Man In Havana (1958) is a novel set in Cuba by the British author Graham Greene. He makes fun of intelligence services, especially the British MI6, and their willingness to believe reports from their local informants. The book predates the Cuban Missile Crisis, but certain aspects of the plot, notably the role of missile installations, appear to anticipate the events of 1962. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1959, directed by Carol Reed and starring Alec Guinness; in 1963 it was adapted into an opera by Malcolm Williamson, to a libretto by Sidney Gilliat, who had worked on the film. In 2007, it was adapted into a play by Clive Francis."

  "text" : "\"Ode to a Nightingale\" is a poem by John Keats written either in the garden of the Spaniards Inn, Hampstead, London or, according to Keats' friend Charles Armitage Brown, under a plum tree in the garden of Keats' house at  Wentworth Place, also in Hampstead. According to Brown, a nightingale had built its nest near the house Keats and Brown shared in the spring of 1819. Inspired by the bird's song, Keats composed the poem in one day. It soon became one of his 1819 odes and was first published in Annals of the Fine Arts the following July. \"Ode to a Nightingale\" is a personal poem that describes Keats's journey into the state of negative capability. The tone of the poem rejects the optimistic pursuit of pleasure found within Keats's earlier poems and, rather, explores the themes of nature, transience and mortality, the latter being particularly personal to Keats. The nightingale described within the poem experiences a type of death but does not actually die. Instead, the songbird is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—as a \"sod\" over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination. The presence of weather is noticeable in the poem, as spring came early in 1819, bringing nightingales all over the heath."

  "text" : "Oblomov (Russian: Обломов; [ɐˈbloməf]) is the second novel by Russian writer Ivan Goncharov, first published in 1859. Ilya Ilych Oblomov is the central character of the novel, portrayed as the ultimate incarnation of the superfluous man, a symbolic character in 19th-century Russian literature. Oblomov is a young, generous nobleman who seems incapable of making important decisions or undertaking any significant actions. Throughout the novel he rarely leaves his room or bed. In the first 50 pages, he manages only to move from his bed to a chair. The book was considered a satire of Russian nobility whose social and economic function was increasingly questioned in mid-nineteenth century Russia. It has been said that no other novel has been used to describe the ever-so-elusive “Russian mentality” or “Russian soul” as frequently as Oblomov. The novel was popular when it came out, and some of its characters and devices have imprinted on Russian culture and language."

It is to the state what the United States Code (U.S.C.) is to the federal government. An innovative feature of the OCGA is that, as stated in section 1-1-1, the privately prepared code annotations are officially merged into the official copy and are published under the authority of the state. This longstanding feature goes back to the Code of 1872. In other states, private prepared code annotations have no official sanction; thus, they are judicially noticeable only to the extent that they restate or quote from officially prepared documents like legislative committee reports. Section 1-1-1 is as follows: The statutory portion of the codification of Georgia laws prepared by the Georgia Code Revision Commission and the Michie Company pursuant to a contract entered into on June 19, 1978, is enacted and shall have the effect of statutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The statutory portion of such codification shall be merged with annotations, captions, catchlines, history lines, editorial notes, cross-references, indices, title and chapter analyses, and other materials pursuant to the contract and shall be published by authority of the state pursuant to such contract and when so published shall be known and may be cited as the 'Official Code of Georgia Annotated'."

  "text" : "On the Road is a novel by American writer Jack Kerouac, based on the travels of Kerouac and his friends across America. It is considered a defining work of the postwar Beat and Counterculture generations, with its protagonists living life against a backdrop of jazz, poetry, and drug use. The novel, published in 1957, is a roman à clef, with many key figures in the Beat movement, such as William S. Burroughs (Old Bull Lee), Allen Ginsberg (Carlo Marx) and Neal Cassady (Dean Moriarty) represented by characters in the book, including Kerouac himself as the narrator Sal Paradise. The idea for On the Road, Kerouac's second novel, was formed during the late 1940s in a series of notebooks, and then typed out on a continuous reel of paper during three weeks in April 1951. It was first published by Viking Press in 1957. After several film proposals dating from 1957, the book was finally made into a film, On the Road (2012), produced by Francis Ford Coppola and directed by Walter Salles. When the book was originally released, The New York Times hailed it as \"the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat,' and whose principal avatar he is.\" In 1998, the Modern Library ranked On the Road 55th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The novel was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005."

  "text" : "On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the tenth novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 1 April 1963. The initial and secondary print runs sold out, with over 60,000 books sold in the first month. Fleming wrote the book in Jamaica whilst the first film in the Eon Productions series of films, Dr. No, was being filmed nearby. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the second book in what is known as the \"Blofeld trilogy\", which begins with Thunderball and concluded with You Only Live Twice. The story centres on Bond's ongoing search to find Ernst Stavro Blofeld after the Thunderball incident; through contact with the College of Arms in London Bond finds Blofeld based in Switzerland. After meeting him and discovering his latest plans, Bond attacks the centre where he is based, although Blofeld escapes in the confusion. Bond meets and falls in love with Contessa Teresa \"Tracy\" di Vicenzo during the story. The pair marry at the end of the story but Blofeld kills Bond's wife, hours after the ceremony. Fleming made a number of revelations about Bond's character within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or had heard of and Blofeld's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races. On Her Majesty's Secret Service received broadly good reviews in the British and American press. The novel was adapted to run as a three-part story in Playboy in 1963 and then as a daily comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper in 1964–1965. In 1969 the novel was adapted as the sixth film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series and was the only film to star George Lazenby as Bond. In 2014 On Her Majesty's Secret Service was adapted as a play on BBC Radio, starring Toby Stephens."

Frank Baum's Oz series. It was the first in which Baum was clearly intending a series of Oz books. It is the first Oz book where the majority of the action takes place outside of the Land of Oz. Only the final two chapters take place in Oz itself. This reflects a subtle change in theme: in the first book, Oz is the dangerous land through which Dorothy must win her way back to Kansas; in the third, Oz is the end and aim of the book. Dorothy's desire to return home is not as desperate as in the first book, and it is her uncle's need for her rather than hers for him that makes her return. It was illustrated throughout in color by artist John R. Neill. The book bore the following dedication: \"To all the boys and girls who read my stories – and especially to the Dorothys – this book is lovingly dedicated.\""

The story is set in a Soviet labor camp in the 1950s and describes a single day of ordinary prisoner Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. The book's publication was an extraordinary event in Soviet literary history since never before had an account of Stalinist repression been openly distributed. Novy Mir editor Aleksandr Tvardovsky wrote a short introduction for the issue entitled \"Instead of a Foreword\" to prepare the journal's readers for what they were about to experience."

The chief editor of the book was Scott Dikkers, with specific sections edited by Robert D. Siegel, Maria Schneider and John Krewson. It was awarded the 1999 Thurber Prize for American Humor. The book, spun off from The Onion weekly-newspaper format of dryly satirizing current events, features mocked-up newspaper front pages from the entire 20th century, presented as though The Onion had been continuously in print since before 1900. The publication of the book is in itself a parody of other end of the century retrospectives that had been published in 1999, notably Time magazine and The New York Times."

  "text" : "On Aggression (German: Das sogenannte Böse zur Naturgeschichte der Aggression) is a 1963 book by the ethologist Konrad Lorenz; it was translated into English in 1966. As he writes in the prologue, \"the subject of this book is aggression, that is to say the fighting instinct in beast and man which is directed against  members of the same species.\" (Page 3) According to Lorenz, animals, particularly males, are biologically programmed to fight over resources. This behavior must be considered part of natural selection, as aggression leading to death or serious injury may eventually lead to extinction unless it has such a role. However, Lorenz does not state that aggressive behaviors are in any way more powerful, prevalent, or intense than more peaceful behaviors such as mating rituals. Rather, he negates the categorization of aggression as \"contrary\" to \"positive\" instincts like love, depicting it as a founding basis of other instincts and its role in animal communication. Additionally, Lorenz addresses behavior in humans, including discussion of a \"hydraulic\" model of emotional or instinctive pressures and their release, shared by Freud, and the abnormality of intraspecies violence and killing. His 'hydraulic' model, of aggression as a force that builds relentlessly without cause unless released, remains less popular than a model in which aggression is a response to frustrated desires and aims."

  "text" : "One Hundred Years of Solitude (Spanish: Cien años de soledad) is a landmark 1967 novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez that tells the multi-generational story of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founds the town of Macondo, the metaphoric Colombia. The magical realist style and thematic substance of One Hundred Years of Solitude established it as an important representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement. Since it was first published in 1967, One Hundred Years of Solitude has been translated into 37 languages and has sold more than 30 million copies. The novel, considered García Márquez's magnum opus, remains widely acclaimed, and is recognized as one of the most significant works in the Spanish literary canon."

  "text" : "Our Mutual Friend, written in the years 1864–65, is the last novel completed by Charles Dickens and is one of his most sophisticated works, combining psychological insight with social analysis. It centres on, in the words of critic J. Hillis Miller, \"money, money, money, and what money can make of life\", but is also about human values. In the opening chapters a body is found in the Thames and identified as that of John Harmon, a young man recently returned to London to receive his inheritance. Were he alive, his father's will would require him to marry Bella Wilfer, a beautiful, mercenary girl whom he had never met. Instead, the money passes to the working-class Boffins, and the effects spread into various corners of London society."

  "text" : "On Liberty is a philosophical work by English philosopher John Stuart Mill, originally intended as a short essay. The work, published in 1859, applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and the state. Mill attempts to establish standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality which he conceived as a prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the summum bonum of Utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill criticized the errors of past attempts to defend individuality where, for example, democratic ideals resulted in the \"tyranny of the majority\". Among the standards established in this work are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society \"which together form the entire doctrine of [Mill's] Essay.\" On Liberty was a greatly influential and well received work, although it did not go without criticism. Some attacked it for its apparent discontinuity with Utilitarianism, while others criticized its vagueness. The ideas presented in On Liberty have remained the basis of much liberal political thought. It has remained in print continuously since its initial publication. To this day, a copy of On Liberty is passed to the president of the British Liberal Democrats as a symbol of office. A copy of the same book is also presented to and then held by the president of the Liberal Party as a symbol of office. Mill's marriage to his wife Harriet Taylor Mill greatly influenced the concepts in On Liberty, which was largely finished prior to her death, and published shortly after she died."

  "text" : "Options is a 1975 absurdist science fiction novel by Robert Sheckley, published in paperback by Pyramid Books. The first British edition appeared in 1977, and a French translation was published in 1979. The story is ostensibly about a marooned space traveller's attempt to get a spare part for his starship, the Intrepid III. He has a robotic guard, programmed to guard him against all planetary dangers. But soon he discovers that the robot has not been programmed for the planet where they are, with comic results. However, the narrative later descends into a mass of diversions, non-sequiturs and meditations on the nature of authorship. Eventually the diversions take over the book to the extent that the author openly introduces an increasingly bizarre succession of deus ex machina in an attempt to get the novel back on track, but eventually admits defeat."

  "text" : "Odd John: A Story Between Jest and Earnest is a 1935 science fiction novel by the British author Olaf Stapledon. The novel explores the theme of the Übermensch (superman) in the character of John Wainwright, whose supernormal human mentality inevitably leads to conflict with normal human society and to the destruction of the utopian colony founded by John and other superhumans. The novel resonates with the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and the work of English writer J. D. Beresford, with an allusion to Beresford's superhuman child character of Victor Stott in The Hampdenshire Wonder (1911). As the devoted narrator remarks, John does not feel obliged to observe the restricted morality of Homo sapiens. Stapledon's recurrent vision of cosmic angst – that the universe may be indifferent to intelligence, no matter how spiritually refined – also gives the story added depth. Later explorations of the theme of the superhuman and of the incompatibility of the normal with the supernormal occur in the works of Stanisław Lem, Frank Herbert, Wilmar Shiras, Robert Heinlein and Vernor Vinge, among others. The book is mentioned by Julian May in Intervention, part of the Galactic Milieu Series. It is also responsible for coining the term \"homo superior\"."

Thus it may ease readers into the fantasy genre."

  "text" : "Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave is a short work of prose fiction by Aphra Behn (1640–1689), published in 1688 by William Canning and reissued with two other fictions later that year. The eponymous hero is an African prince from Coramantien who is tricked into slavery and sold to British colonists in Surinam where he meets the narrator. Behn's text is a first person account of his life, love, rebellion and execution. Behn, often cited as the first known professional female writer,  was a successful playwright, poet, translator and essayist. She began writing prose fiction in the 1680s, probably in response to the consolidation of theatres that led to a reduced need for new plays. Published less than a year before she died, Oroonoko is sometimes described as one of the earliest English novels. Interest in it has increased since the 1970s, critics arguing that Behn is the foremother of British women writers, and that Oroonoko is a crucial text in the history of the novel."

  "text" : "Octopussy and The Living Daylights (sometimes published as Octopussy) is the fourteenth and final James Bond book written by Ian Fleming in the Bond series. The book is a collection of short stories published posthumously in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 23 June 1966. The book originally contained just two stories, \"\" and \"\", with subsequent editions also carrying firstly \"\" and then \"\". The stories were first published in different publications, with \"Octopussy\" first serialised in the Daily Express in October 1965. \"The Living Daylights\" had first appeared in The Sunday Times on 4 February 1962; \"The Property of a Lady\" was published in November 1963 in a Sotheby's publication,  The Ivory Hammer, whilst \"007 in New York\" first appeared in the New York Herald Tribune in October 1963. The two original stories, \"Octopussy\" and \"The Living Daylights\", were both adapted for publication in comic strip format in the Daily Express in 1966–1967. Elements from the stories have also been used in the Eon Productions Bond films. The first, Octopussy, starring Roger Moore as James Bond, was released in 1983 as the thirteenth film in the series and provided the back story for the film Octopussy's family, while \"The Property of a Lady\" was more closely adapted for an auction sequence in the film. The Living Daylights, released in 1987, was the fifteenth Bond film produced by Eon and starred Timothy Dalton in his first appearance as Bond."

The title is derived from the sixth chapter of Book of Revelation, in which one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death, rides upon a pale horse. The book spawned a five-issue comic series, released by Innovation in 1993. It was also the inspiration for the television series, Dead Like Me, which worked on the premise that there are multiple Grim Reapers working the planet."

Chesterton considered this book a companion to his other work, Heretics, writing it expressly in response to G.S. Street's criticism of the earlier work, \"that he was not going to bother about his theology until I had really stated mine\". In the book's preface Chesterton states the purpose is to \"attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.\" In it, Chesterton presents an original view of Christian religion. He sees it as the answer to natural human needs, the \"answer to a riddle\" in his own words, and not simply as an arbitrary truth received from somewhere outside the boundaries of human experience. The book was written when Chesterton was an Anglican. He converted to Catholicism 14 years later. Chesterton chose the title, Orthodoxy, to focus instead on the plainness of the Apostles' Creed, though he admitted the general sound of the title was \"a thinnish sort of thing\". Orthodoxy was influential in the conversion of Theodore Maynard to Roman Catholicism."

  "text" : "Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991 is a book by Michael Azerrad. It chronicles the careers of several underground rock bands who, while finding little or no mainstream success, were hugely influential in establishing American alternative and indie rock, mostly through nearly constant touring and records released on small, regional independent record labels. Azerrad conducted many interviews with band members, and also conducted extensive research of old fanzines, as well as more mainstream newspapers and books. The inspiration for the book occurred when Azerrad was watching a miniseries about rock music history. According to Azerrad after exploring the punk era \"it skipped and went straight from Talking Heads to Nirvana. \"I thought, This is insane. Did I black out for 10 minutes? I thought that someone should do something about this. And I had, appropriately enough, a DIY moment and I thought, Maybe I should do it.\" The title comes from the opening line of \"History Lesson – Part II\", an autobiographical song written by Mike Watt of Minutemen, one of the bands featured in the book. The song, which is on the album Double Nickels on the Dime, details the band's working class origins and populist sentiments: \"Punk rock changed our lives.\" The book is dedicated to the lives of D. Boon (Minutemen) and Bob Stinson (The Replacements). The book focuses on 13 bands: \n* Black Flag (from Hermosa Beach/Los Angeles, California) \n* Minutemen (from San Pedro/Los Angeles, California) \n* Mission of Burma (from Boston, Massachusetts) \n* Minor Threat (from Washington, D.C.) \n* Hüsker Dü (from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota) \n* The Replacements (from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota) \n* Sonic Youth (from New York City, New York) \n* Butthole Surfers (from San Antonio, Texas) \n* Big Black (from Evanston/Chicago, Illinois) \n* Dinosaur Jr. (from Amherst, Massachusetts) \n* Fugazi (from Washington, D.C.) \n* Mudhoney (from Seattle, Washington) \n* Beat Happening (from Olympia, Washington) In honor of this book's 10th Anniversary, Azerrad had put together a special concert at Bowery Ballroom with contemporary bands and artists to perform the music of bands covered in the text. For example, Ted Leo played Minor Threat and Titus Andronicus played The Replacements."

  "text" : "One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society is a 1964 book by philosopher Herbert Marcuse, in which Marcuse offers a wide-ranging critique of both contemporary capitalism and the Communist society of the Soviet Union, documenting the parallel rise of new forms of social repression in both these societies, as well as the decline of revolutionary potential in the West. He argues that \"advanced industrial society\" created false needs, which integrated individuals into the existing system of production and consumption via mass media, advertising, industrial management, and contemporary modes of thought. This results in a \"one-dimensional\" universe of thought and behaviour, in which aptitude and ability for critical thought and oppositional behaviour wither away. Against this prevailing climate, Marcuse promotes the \"great refusal\" (described at length in the book) as the only adequate opposition to all-encompassing methods of control. Much of the book is a defense of \"negative thinking\" as a disrupting force against the prevailing positivism. Marcuse also analyzes the integration of the industrial working class into capitalist society and new forms of capitalist stabilization, thus questioning the Marxian postulates of the revolutionary proletariat and the inevitability of capitalist crisis. In contrast to orthodox Marxism, Marcuse champions non-integrated forces of minorities, outsiders, and radical intelligentsia, attempting to nourish oppositional thought and behavior through promoting radical thinking and opposition. He considers the trends towards bureaucracy in supposedly Marxist countries to be as oppositional to freedom as those in the capitalist West. One-Dimensional Man was the book that made Marcuse famous."

  "text" : "Omeros is an epic poem by Caribbean writer Derek Walcott, first published in 1990. The work is divided into seven \"books\" containing a total of sixty-four chapters. Many critics view Omeros as Walcott's \"major achievement.\" Soon after its publication in 1990, it received praise from publications like The Washington Post and The New York Times Book Review, the latter of which chose the book as one of its \"Best Books of 1990\" and called it \"one of Mr. Walcott's finest poetic works.\" The book also won the WH Smith Literary Award in 1991. In 1992, Walcott was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Nobel committee member who presented the award, Professor Kjell Espmark, singled out Walcott's most recent achievement at the time, Omeros, recognizing the book as a \"major work\". Walcott painted the cover for the book, which depicts some of his main characters at sea together in a boat. In 2004, the critic Hilton Als of The New Yorker called the book \"Walcott's masterpiece\" and characterized the poem as \"the perfect marriage of Walcott’s classicism and his nativism\"."

  "text" : "On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (19 April 1817) is a book by David Ricardo on economics. The book concludes that land rent grows as population increases. It also presents the theory of comparative advantage, the theory that free trade between two or more countries can be mutually beneficial, even when one country has an absolute advantage over the other countries in all areas of production. Ricardo claims in the preface that Turgot, Stuart, Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, Sismondi, and others had not written enough \"satisfactory information\" on the topics of rent, profit, and wages. Principles of Political Economy is Ricardo's effort to fill that gap in the literature. Regardless of whether the book achieved that goal, it secured, according to Ronald Max Hartwell, Ricardo's position among the great classical economists Adam Smith, Thomas Robert Malthus, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Heinrich Marx. In his book Adam's Fallacy: A Guide to Economic Theology, economist Duncan K. Foley highlights that in the Principles Ricardo criticizes Adam Smith's treatment of the theory of value and distribution for circular reasoning, in particular as far as concerns rent, and that Ricardo considers the labor theory of value, properly understood, a more logically sound basis for political economic reasoning. Foley also discusses the chapter On Machinery, which Ricardo included in his third and final (1821) version of Principles. Here Ricardo famously analysed the impact of the adoption of machinery on the different classes of society, revising his earlier view that mechanization could be expected to be of benefit to each of the classes of the society. The increase in productivity due to mechanization lowers the production costs and thus also the real prices of commodities. Whereas the landowning class and capitalists benefit from the lower prices, workers in contrast do not reap such benefit from the lower prices if capitalists reduce the wage fund in order to finance the expensive machinery, causing technological unemployment among workers. In this case, Ricardo points out, wages are forced down by competition among workers, and the introduction of new machines can lead to an over-all decline in the well-being of the working class."

  "text" : "On Growth and Form is a book by the Scottish mathematical biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948). The book is long – 793 pages in the first edition of 1917, 1116 pages in the second edition of 1942. The book covers many topics including the effects of scale on the shape of animals and plants, large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape; the effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells; the logarithmic spiral as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns; the arrangement of leaves and other plant parts (phyllotaxis); and Thompson's own method of transformations, showing the changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a Cartesian grid. The work is widely admired by biologists, anthropologists and architects among others, but less often read than cited. Peter Medawar explains this as being because it clearly pioneered the use of mathematics in biology, and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism; but that the book is weakened by Thompson's failure to understand the role of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. Philip Ball on the other hand suspects that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism."

Kennedy assassination, which the human rights activist called \"merely a case of 'chickens coming home to roost.'\" Churchill used the term \"Roosting Chickens\" in a short essay, Some People Push Back': On the Justice of Roosting Chickens\", first published on September 12, 2001. In that article, Churchill claimed that the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States were \"acts of war\" by the \"Islamic East\" in defense against the \"crusades\" waged by the \"Christian West\" (e.g. Arab-Israeli conflict and The First Gulf War) throughout the late 20th century."

Its authors espouse the pseudoscientific concept of intelligent design—namely that life shows evidence of being designed by an intelligent agent which is not named specifically in the book, although proponents understand that it refers to the Christian God. They present various polemical arguments against the scientific theory of evolution. A third edition of the book was proposed, and was published in 2007 under the title The Design of Life: Discovering Signs of Intelligence in Biological Systems as a sequel."

  "text" : "Of a Boy (What The Birds See in the UK and US) is a 2002 novel by Sonya Hartnett about a lonely and troubled youth.The omnipresent narrator follows the plight of Adrian, a 9 year old child, who was taken away from his mother as she was \"unfit to care for him\". Adrian spends his days thinking of things that unsettle him such as sea monsters and growing purple hair. One of the things that most disturb him is the fact that three children, surnamed Metford, disappear from a neighborhood near his around the beginning of the book. Shortly after the disappearance of the Metford children, a twelve-year-old girl called Nicole moves in across the street from Adrian. She has no friends and doesn't attend school, but she mystifies Adrian and he soon becomes obsessed with her as he loses his only friend Clinton. The novel ends tragically with Adrian and Nicole falling beneath a pool cover (while trying to find the abducted children) in winter and being unable to break through to the air. The story ends with Adrian's grandmother believing him to be abducted, just as the Metford children."

  "text" : "Our Common Future, also known as the Brundtland Report, from the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) was published in 1987. Its targets were multilateralism and interdependence of nations in the search for a sustainable development path. The report sought to recapture the spirit of the Stockholm Conference - which had introduced environmental concerns to the formal political development sphere. Our Common Future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda; it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue. The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised: written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world. The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: 1.  \n* “ re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them;  2.  \n*  strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and to assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and 3.  \n*  raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention in the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “[the] analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987: 16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed (and expanded); this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development. The publication of Our Common Future and the work of the World Commission on Environment and Development laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992 Earth Summit and the adoption of Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration and to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. An oft-quoted definition of sustainable development is defined in the report as: \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" In addition, key contributions of Our Common Future to the concept of sustainable development include the recognition that the many crises facing the planet are interlocking crises that are elements of a single crisis of the whole  and of the vital need for the active participation of all sectors of society in consultation and decisions relating to sustainable development. Our Common Future is also known as the Brundtland Report in recognition of former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's role as Chair of the World Commission on Environment and Development."

The Ateneu has very strict rules imposed by its headmaster—Aristarco—which cause a general sense of riot amongst the students; homosexuality is common amongst most students, which is partially explained due to the presence of a single woman in the school—the nurse and wife of Aristarco, Dona Ema—and the lack of contact with the external world."

The novel is about a writer named Sidney Orr (a short, Americanized version of the Polish surname Orlovsky), who, after making a miraculous recovery from near fatal illness, buys a new notebook and starts writing a story about a man who completely changed his life when he realised how much his existence was ruled by coincidence. The base premises for the book is this, Sidney Orr trying to come back to his life and begin writing again, but a lot of things happen in his life at the same time, and the reader gets introduced not only to Sidney's work and personal life, but also in some extent to the life of the person in his work-in-progress novel. Before the end of this period in Sidney's life, events will take place that are truly life-altering, and Sidney will, much like the fictional character he writes of, have to deal with issues and questions he has previously (perhaps unconsciously) been avoiding for several years."

Prime Minister David Cameron chose Our Island Story when asked to select his favourite childhood book in October 2010: \"When I was younger, I particularly enjoyed 'Our Island Story' by Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall [...] It is written in a way that really captured my imagination and which nurtured my interest in the history of our great nation.\" The book depicts the union of England and Scotland as a desirable and inevitable event, and praises rebels and the collective will of the common people in opposing tyrants, including kings like John and Charles I."

  "text" : "Off the Road: Twenty Years with Cassady, Kerouac and Ginsberg is an autobiographical book by Carolyn Cassady. Originally published in 1990 as Off the Road: My Years with Cassady, Kerouac, and Ginsberg, it was republished by London's Black Spring Press, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of Jack Kerouac's seminal On the Road. Off the Road recounts the history of Carolyn Cassady, wife of Jack Kerouac's traveling companion and On the Road's hero Neal Cassady. As Neal's wife and Kerouac's intermittent lover, Carolyn Cassady was well situated to record the inception of the Beat Generation and its influence on American culture. Off the Road begins in the initial stages of Kerouac and Neal Cassady's friendship, when Kerouac was a struggling author trying to publish his first novel (1950's The Town and the City), and documents important moments in the beat movement such as the success of On the Road and Allen Ginsberg's \"Howl.\""

It is a social and political satire skewering the human foibles of all its characters. The main character is James Arnold Ross Jr., nicknamed Bunny, son of an oil tycoon. Bunny's sympathetic feelings toward oilfield workers and socialists provoke arguments with his father throughout the story. The novel served as a loose inspiration for the 2007 film There Will Be Blood."

  "text" : "On Narcissism (German: Zur Einführung des Narzißmus) is a 1914 essay by Sigmund Freud, widely considered an introduction to Freud's theories of narcissism. In this paper, Freud sums up his earlier discussions on the subject of narcissism and considers its place in sexual development. Furthermore, he looks at the deeper problems of the relation between the ego and external objects, drawing a new distinction between the 'ego-libido' and 'object-libido'. Most importantly he introduces the idea of the 'ego ideal', and the self- observing agency related to it. Freud also looks briefly at his controversies with Carl Jung and Alfred Adler, indeed one of his motives for writing this was probably to show that the concept of narcissism offers an alternative to Jung's non-sexual 'libido' and Adler's 'masculine protest'."

The story is told through the eyes of his daughter, Patsy Henry. It is also told by his younger daughter, Anne Henry. Patrick Henry travels the American colonies, advocating independence from England. As the mother of a large family and wife of Patrick Henry succumbs to a genetic mental disorder, she is removed to a cellar prison in her own house, where she shows the power to predict future outcomes. Her family is left to cope with her absence, even as they are threatened to be torn apart by the knowledge that their middle child may have inherited their mother's disease."

Before this novel, Evanovich wrote 11 category romance novels. She then \"ran out of sexual positions and decided to move into the mystery genre.\" Before writing One For the Money, her first mystery novel, Evanovich spent two years investigating the world of law enforcement, shadowing both bail enforcement agents and the Trenton police, observing their actions and the equipment they carried. She also learned how to shoot a gun. One For the Money was named a New York Times Notable Book, a Publishers Weekly \"Best Book of 1994,\" and a USA Today \"Best Bet.\" For this book, Evanovich also won the 1995 Dilys Award, one of only three authors to do so for their first mystery (the others being Julia Spencer-Fleming and Louise Penney). This novel introduced characters that would frequent the subsequent novels. As of September 2016, there have been 24 published novels, four novellas, and one short story in the Stephanie Plum series."

In 2005, it was the One Book, One Vancouver selection. The book is often required reading for university English courses on Canadian Literature. It also figures in Ethnic Studies and Asian American Literature [sic] courses in the United States. Kogawa uses strong imagery of silence, stones and streams throughout the novel. She has lots of interesting dreams that are carried throughout the novel as well. Themes depicted in the novel include memory and forgetting, prejudice and tolerance, identity, and justice versus injustice. Kogawa contemplates many of these themes in her poetry as well."

  "text" : "Orientalism is a 1978 book by Edward W. Said, in which Said studies the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism, the West's patronizing perceptions and fictional depictions of \"The East\" — the societies and peoples who inhabit the places of Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. Orientalism, the Western scholarship about the Eastern World, was and remains inextricably tied to the imperialist societies who produced it, which makes much Orientalist work inherently political and servile to power, and thus intellectually suspect. In the Middle East, the social, economic, and cultural practices of the ruling Arab élites indicate they are imperial satraps who have internalized the romanticized \"Arab Culture\" created by French, British and, later, American Orientalists; the examples include critical analyses of the colonial literature of Joseph Conrad, which conflates a people, a time, and a place into a narrative of incident and adventure in an exotic land. The critical application of post-structuralism in the scholarship of Orientalism influenced the development of literary theory, cultural criticism, and the field of Middle Eastern studies, especially regarding how academics practice their intellectual enquiry when examining, describing, and explaining the Middle East. The scope of Said's scholarship established Orientalism as a foundation text in the field of Post-colonial Culture Studies, which examines the denotations and connotations of Orientalism, and the history of a country's post-colonial period. As a public intellectual, Edward Said debated Orientalism with historians and scholars of area studies, notably, the Orientalist and historian Bernard Lewis, who said that the thesis of Orientalism was “anti-Western”. For subsequent editions of Orientalism, Said wrote an \"Afterword\" (1995) and a \"Preface\" (2003) addressing criticisms of the content, substance, and style of the work as cultural criticism."

The US Marine Corps Combined Action Program unit assigned to the Vietnamese village of Bun Hou, Tango Niner, has been very successful in suppressing Viet-Cong operations in the area, and now starts putting a crimp in the get-rich-off-overtaxing-the-villager schemes of the local ARVN District Chief, Captain Nghu. Nghu, in return, manages to arrange the planting of drugs within the Marines' compound, and the subsequent \"discovery\" of the drugs by the Marines' chain of command. The steps taken by command to deal with the supposed breach of discipline means that Nghu will now have a freer rein with the peasants, as well as degrading Tango-Niner's effectiveness in suppressing VC activity."

  "text" : "One, No One and One Hundred Thousand (Italian: Uno, Nessuno e Centomila [ˈuːno nesˈsuːno e ˌtʃɛntoˈmiːla]) is a 1926 novel by the Italian writer Luigi Pirandello. The novel had a rather long and difficult period of gestation. Pirandello began writing it in 1909. In an autobiographical letter, published in 1924, the author refers to this work as the \"...bitterest of all, profoundly humoristic, about the decomposition of life: Moscarda one, no one and one hundred thousand.\" The pages of the unfinished novel remained on Pirandello's desk for years and he would occasionally take out extracts and insert them into other works only to return, later, to the novel in a sort of uninterrupted compositive circle. Finally finished, Uno, Nessuno e Centomila came out in episodes between December 1925 and June 1926 in the magazine Fiera Letteraria. But the long phases of its compositive development should not mislead one into thinking of this work as a fragmentary and disorganized collection of situations and experiences from which the author drew and then tried to mesh together within the confines of one novel. On the contrary, this novel which accompanied the most significant years of Pirandello's productive career signals the absolute apex of the narrative tension of the writer. It is not by chance that the search for authenticity, a predominant theme of Pirandellian narrative writing, culminates precisely in the adventures of Vitangelo Moscarda, the protagonist of this novel. The name Moscarda recalls the name of Mostardo, the protagonist of Il cavalier Mostardo (1921) by Antonio Beltramelli, very famous at that time. Mostardo was an extraordinary man, but Moscarda was an ordinary man."

The book was popular with readers, spending five weeks atop the New York Times Best Seller list in the winter of 1943. The book was made into a motion picture in 1944, and was dramatized by Jean Kerr in 1946."

  "text" : "Oh No It Isn't! is a novel published in 1997 by Paul Cornell from the Virgin New Adventures featuring the fictional archaeologist Bernice Summerfield. The New Adventures were a series of novels based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who, made by the BBC. They had originally been licensed Doctor Who stories, but in the wake of the return of Doctor Who to television screens with the 1996 movie, the BBC did not renew publisher Virgin Books' licence. Virgin had for some time planned for a spin-off series based on the characters and settings created in the Doctor Who New Adventures. With the licence gone, they continued the monthly release schedule of the New Adventures, but switched to stories featuring the character of Bernice Summerfield (known as Benny), beginning with Oh No It Isn't!. The author, Paul Cornell, had originally created Benny as a companion for the Doctor. She appeared regularly in the Doctor Who New Adventures for a period, before ceasing travelling with the Doctor in another Cornell-penned work, Happy Endings. She was re-introduced as a regular character in the last Doctor Who New Adventure, The Dying Days, which led into Oh No It Isn't!. Oh No It Isn't! also provided the initial set-up and background to the Benny-led New Adventures that followed, including re-introducing the Doctor's pet cat Wolsey (originally from Cornell's New Adventure Human Nature) and the artificial intelligence known as God (originally from the New Adventure The Also People). The book also introduces the alien race the Grels, who would re-appear in later Benny stories. The novel title and content reference the traditions of pantomime, reflecting Cornell's interest in traditional conceptions and icons of Englishness."

  "text" : "\"On Translating Beowulf\" is an essay by J. R. R. Tolkien which discusses the difficulties faced by anyone attempting to translate the Old English heroic-elegiac poem Beowulf into modern English. It was first published in 1940 as a preface contributed by Tolkien to a translation of Old English poetry; it was first published as an essay under its current name in the 1983 collection The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays. In the essay, Tolkien explains the difficulty of translating individual words from Old English, noting that a word like eacen ('large', 'strong', 'supernaturally powerful') cannot readily be translated by the same word in each case. He notes the problem of translating poetic kennings such as sundwudu ('flood-timber', i.e. 'ship') and that the language chosen by the poet was already archaic at that moment. He explains that such terms had echoes and connotations of another world, an \"unrecapturable magic\". The essay describes Old English metre, with each line in two opposed halves. The stressed syllables in each half contained alliterating sounds in six possible patterns, which Tolkien illustrates using modern English. Rhyme is used only for special effects, such as to imitate waves beating on a shore. The essay ends with the observation that the whole poem is itself in two opposed halves, covering \"Youth + Age; he rose – fell.\" Critics note that Tolkien attempted and sometimes failed to follow the rules he laid down in the essay in his own alliterative verse, in his own translations, and indeed in his narrative fiction such as Lord of the Rings."

  "text" : "Odes et Ballades, published in 1828, is the most complete version of a collection of poems by Victor Hugo written and published between 1822 and 1828. It includes five books of odes and one book of ballads. They are among his very earliest works, and reflect the Catholic royalist views of his early twenties. He would write seven different prefaces for it, dated 1822, 1823, 1824, 1826, 1828, followed by one in 1853, at which time he was in self-imposed exile, and a final one in 1880. Hugo expresses a view of the difference between \"order\" and \"regularity\" which elevates the former on the basis that an irregularity in art can have its own logic, or order, and achieve effects impossible to regularity, or classical evenness. The version of 1826 received a generally positive review from the 22-year-old Sainte-Beuve in the Globe (January 1827), and this review resulted in their friendship. The collection includes Ode à la Colonne de la Place Vendôme, a response to the Austrian ambassador's decision in early 1827 to stop recognizing Napoleonic titles. First published in the Journal des débats, it represents the first praise of Napoleon in Hugo's work (but not a major political shift as he later claimed). It should be distinguished from the ode on the same subject in Les Chants du crépuscule."

The book, a best-seller, grew out of a long article published in a September 1991 issue of The New Yorker. According to the book cover: With a sure satirical eye, Richler takes a look at what he calls \"the western world's goofiest and most unnecessary political crisis. English-speaking Quebecers endure Draconian language laws prohibiting English or bilingual signs in Montreal because they are seen as an affront to the city's visage linguistique."

  "text" : "Obernewtyn is the first novel in the Obernewtyn Chronicles series by Australian author Isobelle Carmody. Carmody began writing it at the age of fourteen, and reworked the novel through high school and university. Much of the inspiration for the protagonist, Elspeth Gordie, comes from her own life experiences. It was published by Penguin Books in Australia in 1988 and shortlisted for the Book of the Year for Older Readers in the Children's Book Council of Australia Awards. A science fiction-fantasy novel set in a post-apocalyptic world, the story follows Elspeth Gordie, an orphan with special mental abilities, who lives a life of fear and danger. When her abilities are brought to the attention of the ruling, totalitarian Council, she is banished to the remote mountain institution of Obernewtyn, where all \"Misfits\" are sent. The leaders of Obernewtyn are secretly searching for the old weapons that had sent the world to the brink of despair, and Elspeth finds herself embroiled in a plot that risks more than just her personal safety. The book has been published in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany and Portugal. The Library Journal stated it was a \"thought-provoking tale of courage and sacrifice\"; other reviews found it one-dimensional and difficult to follow. Adapted as a stage play by Caroline Heske, it was performed in Darwin, Australia in 2004 by the Corrugated Iron Youth Arts Theatre."

The book gives an account of Werner H. Erhard's early life as Jack Rosenberg, his exploration of various forms of self-improvement techniques, and his foundation of Erhard Seminars Training \"est\" and later of Werner Erhard and Associates and of the Est successor course, \"The Forum\". Pressman details the rapid financial success Erhard had with these companies, as well as controversies relating to litigation involving former participants in his courses. The work concludes by going over the impact of a March 3, 1991 60 Minutes broadcast on CBS where members of Erhard's family made allegations against him, and Erhard's decision to leave the United States. Representatives of Werner Erhard and of Landmark Education, the successor company to The Forum, regarded the book as being \"defamatory\". There are no references or citations provided in the book."

  "text" : "On Becoming Baby Wise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep is an infant management book written by pediatrician Robert Bucknam, M.D. and co-author Gary Ezzo in 1993. Formerly published by Multnomah Books, Baby Wise is currently published by Parent-Wise Solutions; approximately 3 million copies have been sold and it has been translated into 16 languages around the world. Baby Wise presents an infant care program which the authors say will cause babies to sleep through the night beginning between seven and nine weeks of age. It emphasizes parental control of the infant's sleep, play and feeding schedule rather than allowing the baby to decide when to eat, play and sleep. The Baby Wise program outlined in the book came under criticism from some pediatricians and parents who were concerned that an infant reared using the book's advice will be at higher risk of failure to thrive, malnutrition, and emotional disorders."

  "text" : "Os Maias: Episódios da Vida Romântica (\"The Maias: Episodes of Romantic Life\") is a realist novel by Portuguese author José Maria de Eça de Queiroz, also known under the modernized spelling Eça de Queirós. Maia is the name of a fictional family, although some episodes fit into the history of the real Maia family. As early as 1878, while serving in the Portuguese consulate at Newcastle upon Tyne, Eça had at least given a name to this book and had begun working on it. It was mainly written during his residence in Bristol, and it was first published in 1888. The book largely concerns the life of young aristocrat Carlos da Maia in 1870s Portugal, when along with his best friend João da Ega he spends his time making witticisms about society and having affairs. The novel uses the Monarchy's decline in Portugal (late 19th century), as a predominant theme, reflecting its author's own regret at his country's slow decay. The analysis of the book is compulsory for 11th year students in Portugal."

  "text" : "Ox-Cart Man is the title of a 1979 book written by Donald Hall and illustrated by Barbara Cooney. It won the 1980 Caldecott Medal. The book tells of the life and work of an early 19th-century farming family in New Hampshire. The father uses an ox-cart to take their goods to market in Portsmouth, where they make the money to buy the things they need for the next year. Even the ox and cart are sold. Hall originally published \"Ox-Cart Man\" as a poem in the October 3, 1977, issue of The New Yorker. Hall revised the poem greatly to create the children's book and chose Barbara Cooney for its illustrations. Cooney had illustrated another Caldecott Medal-winning book, Chanticleer and the Fox.) Both the earlier version of the poem and the book are cyclical in narrative and theme. This book was featured on a Season 2 episode of Reading Rainbow."

  "text" : "On the Track of Unknown Animals is a cryptozoological book by the Belgian-French author Bernard Heuvelmans that was first published in 1955 under the title Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées. The English translation by Richard Garnett was published in 1958 with some updating by the author and with a foreword by Gerald Durrell. A revised and abridged edition was published in 1965, and a further edition in 1995. It is credited with introducing the term cryptozoology. On the Track of Unknown Animals cites animals that had only been discovered relatively recently, such as the pygmy chimpanzee, coelacanth, Komodo dragon and giant panda; and those that are believed to have become extinct relatively recently, such as the moa and Tasmanian tiger. The author then discusses evidence for cryptids from all over the world including the Mokele-mbembe, sea serpents and the Yeti, with an extensive bibliography. He begins by complaining that \"The Press has made such a laughing-stock of the Loch Ness Monster... that no scientific commission has ever dared tackle the problem\" and ends with the wish that any new species are not merely slaughtered for trophies: \"Have pity on them all, for it is we who are the real monsters.\""

  "text" : "The Old History of the Five Dynasties (Chinese: 舊五代史; pinyin: Jiù Wǔdài Shǐ) was an official history of the Five Dynasties (907–960), which controlled much of northern China. It was compiled by the Song Dynasty official-scholar Xue Juzheng in the first two decades of the Song Dynasty, which was founded in 960. It is one of the Twenty-Four Histories recognized through Chinese history. The book comprises 150 chapters, and was in effect divided into 5 books, Book of Liang, Book of Tang, Book of Jin, Book of Han and Book of Zhou. After the New History of the Five Dynasties by Ouyang Xiu was published, it was no longer popular. The fatal blow came in the 12th century when it was removed from the Imperial Library and was no longer published by order of the Jin dynasty. The book was lost during this period. During the 18th century, Qing Dynasty scholars found many complete quotes of the book in Yongle Da Dian. They extracted them and together with other sources of the same period, they were able to largely reconstruct the book, although missing a few chapters. There have been rumours that copies of the original book exist but to date, none has been found."

The book, first published in 1937, recounts events of the seventeen years when Blixen made her home in Kenya, then called British East Africa. The book is a lyrical meditation on Blixen’s life on her coffee plantation, as well as a tribute to some of the people who touched her life there. It provides a vivid snapshot of African colonial life in the last decades of the British Empire. Blixen wrote the book in English and then rewrote it in Danish."

The book opens with Hayden, a special education teacher, reading a newspaper article about a six-year-old girl who attempted to burn a three-year-old boy a couple of days prior. As there was no place for her at the hospital, she ends up as a student in Hayden's class, where she remains for about five months. The book is based on the author's real life experiences. A sequel, The Tiger's Child, was published in 1995."

The entire vocabulary in One Hand Clapping amounts to approximately 800 words. Francis Coppola has acquired the movie rights."

  "text" : "Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival? A Scientific Detective Story is a 1996 book by Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski, and John Peterson Myers. The book chronicles the development of the endocrine disruptor hypothesis by Colborn. Though written for the popular press in narrative form, the book contains a substantial amount of scientific evidence. A foreword from then Vice President Al Gore increased the book's visibility. It ultimately influenced government policy through congressional hearings and helped foster the development of a research and regulation initiative within the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The authors also started a website which continues to monitor and report on endocrine disruptor scientific research. Thousands of scientific articles have since been published on endocrine disruption, demonstrating the availability of grant money for research on the hypothesis raised by Our Stolen Future. For example, a symposium at the 2007 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meeting explored the contribution of endocrine disruption to obesity and metabolic disorder. As is often the case, there is strong animal evidence but few epidemiological tests of predictions based on the animal experiments. A recent analysis of Center for Disease Control (CDC) data finds an extraordinary increase in risk to type II diabetes as a function of exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), in particular synthetic organic chemicals such as organohalogens."

The book is part fiction, part diary, part an old man's apologia and part a pamphlet in opposition to the ruling given in the 1948 court trial against him, that he had \"permanently impaired mental abilities\". The original Norwegian version was titled Paa gjengrodde Stier."

  "text" : "Our Lady of the Assassins (Spanish title: La virgen de los sicarios) is a semi-autobiographical novel by the Colombian writer Fernando Vallejo about an author in his fifties who returns to his hometown of Medellín after 30 years of absence to find himself trapped in an atmosphere of violence and murder caused by drug cartel warfare. The novel was later adapted into a film that received different international recognitions like the Aware of the Italian Senate, the Venice Film Festival (2000) as the best Latin American film and the La Habana International Festival \"Nuevo Cine\" (2000). A growing body of scholarship and critical commentary already exist about this controversial work, most of it in Spanish. The brief sections below attempt to give the reader a basic understanding of some main approaches to what undoubtedly is a central work in Colombian fiction of the 1990s. An elaborated and discussed fictional work dealing with events related to the drug trade and its deleterious consequences in Colombian society. Notice: Any text from the novel in this article is a free translation by Wikipedians, and should not be considered official. The novel was formally translated into English in 2001."

  "text" : "On Truth is the book 2006 follow-up to Harry Frankfurt's 1986 essay, On Bullshit. In \"On Truth\", Frankfurt develops the argument that individuals should care about the truth, regardless of whether they intend to be truthful. Frankfurt explicitly avoids a definition of \"truth\" beyond the idea of the commonsense concept of truth people commonly hold, i.e., that which corresponds to reality. Frankfurt's strategy is to show that the truth, whether an individual is to be truthful or not, is integral to nearly every endeavor, the final point of his argument being that it is a requirement for self-knowledge and therefore all distinctions between ourselves and the world. Frankfurt concludes that the importance of truth, and thus the need to care about it, is incorrigible thereby."

  "text" : "Of Love and Other Demons (Spanish: Del amor y otros demonios) is a novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez, first published in 1994. In the prologue, García Márquez claims the novel is the fictional representation of a legend the author was told by his grandmother as a child: of a 12-year-old girl who contracts rabies but was believed to be a 'miracle-worker', with long flowing copper hair that continues to grow after death. In this frame-story, it was only after an excavation of tombs that García Márquez is witness to the grave of a similar young girl with long red hair still attached to the skull, that he was inspired to write Of Love and Other Demons. Mariana Solanet, however, in García Márquez for Beginners, states this source was invented. She points rather to a story in Daniel Lemaitre's History of Cartagena that García Márquez came across in research for Love in the Time of Cholera. In 2008, the opera Love and Other Demons, by Hungarian composer Péter Eötvös was premiered at the Glyndebourne Festival."

Once More, with Feeling is their account of the time they spent researching and shooting the film. The film they made was entitled The Naughty Twins and was only screened for \"friends, colleagues and some blokes off the telly\". Rowan Pelling, writing for The Independent, stated that \"the plot was labyrinthine\" and claimed she \"particularly liked a lesbian bath scene where a muscular plumber enters the room with an enormous spanner, consults his pager, then says, \"Oh dear, wrong day!\" and promptly disappears.\" The book deal was in place before the movie was shot."

  "text" : "Old Angel Midnight is a long narrative poem by American novelist and poet Jack Kerouac. It was culled from five notebooks spanning from 1956 to 1959, while Kerouac was fully absorbed by his studies of Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy. Kerouac initially experimented with Old Angel Midnight (then called \"Lucien Midnight\") in 1953 in his diary titled \"1953. Notes again.\" In entries dated from November 20 to December 3, 1953, he made notes on \"Lucien Midnight\" which was to be originally conceptualized in what he called \"book movie\" form, when he closed his eyes and projected onto paper a cinematic sense of what he heard. A bookmovie, he explained in Some of the Dharma, is a \"prose concentration camera-eye visions of a definite movie of the mind with fade-ins, pans, close-ups, and fade-outs.\" Kerouac's notes on Lucien Midnight were written while staying in the Lower East Side where he initially heard sounds coming through a tenement window from the wash court below. He then heard voices coming from kitchens of the other occupants in nearby apartment buildings and a man named Paddy arriving home drunk, and even a junky stirring in his bed. Kerouac conceptualized an idea of developing a work based on James Joyce’s experimental novel Finnegans Wake (not Ulysses as indicated by Ann Charters in her introduction to Old Angel Midnight for Grey Fox Press) where the “sounds of the universe” became the chief “plot” with all of its associated “neologisms, mental associations, puns and wordmixes” that stewed a plethora of languages and “nonlanguages.” Kerouac determinedly “scribbled out in a strictly intuitional discipline at breakneck speed” the fledgling prose that would finally comprise the finished book for City Lights's Pocket Poet series eight years later. Kerouac's one dogma was to compose Lucien Midnight strictly in pencil by candlelight. Lucien Midnight differs from his sketching method of writing because it is based upon an aural experience, and not visual. The bookmovie approach was abandoned in 1953 in favor of a different approach he had stylistically achieved by 1956. In other notes from the time, Kerouac described Lucien Midnight as a \"monolog of the world.\" On March 1, 1957, while staying with William S. Burroughs in Tangiers, Kerouac worked on Lucien Midnight. Kerouac said of the poem: Kerouac began the first notebook on April 1, 1956. By now his spontaneous prose method had become second nature to him. Kerouac was staying with Gary Snyder in his Mill Valley cabin. Writing John Clellon Holmes on May 21, 1956, Kerouac explained his intentions: “I don’t know what to write anymore, I’ve been doodling with an endless automatic writing piece which raves on and on with no direction and no story and surely that wont do tho I’ll finish it anyway while doing other things. Old Angel Midnight was first printed in Big Table 1, 1959. Big Table was a new magazine started by Paul Carrol and Irving Rosenthal published after the University of Chicago censored the student magazine, The Chicago Review. A \"prose picnic\" is what Judge Julius Hoffman called Kerouac's poem, in the ensuing trial of the Post Office vs. Big Table. To Kerouac, Old Angel Midnight was the only “form in which I am allowed to say anything I want because not only I’ve got to approximate the speed and content of mindflow naked word-babble,” but that it could give him to “swim” with absolute freedom, “dedicatedly crazed in the sea of that language.” Within the scope of that work, Kerouac envisioned the voices he heard discussing the “long weekend from Friday afternoon as it moves into Sunday night.” When he prepared drafts for eventual publication, Lucien Carr objected to the use of his first name, telling Kerouac that it was “pejorative.” It should have been, Kerouac explained to Ginsberg in a letter on August 28, 1958, “majorative,” referring to Lucien Midnight's intended all-encompassing universal sweep of humanity and its surrounding cosmos. In December 1958, Kerouac stayed up through the night skimming through the pages of the Holy Bible and an English dictionary looking for a replacement title. When he heard Charles Van Doren, on a morning talk show (the son of Mark Van Doren and notoriously involved in a television quiz show scandal that decade) refer to a phrase from Mark Twain’s journal, Kerouac had his answer. Twain writes, \"I never felt so happy in my life, sir — never since I was born, sir. Loved that hoary, venerable old angel as if he was my father, sir.” Lucien Midnight then became Old Angel Midnight. Kerouac dedicated the poem to Lucien Carr, a friend of Kerouac who was a key member of the early Beat Generation, and whose manner of speech was the initial inspiration for Old Angel Midnight."

  "text" : "Old Souls: The Scientific Search for Proof of Past Lives is a non-fiction book by journalist Tom Shroder. An editor at The Washington Post, Shroder traveled extensively with psychiatrist Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia, who conducted past life and reincarnation research in Lebanon, India and the American South. Shroder's journalistic experience makes this book a valuable review of an often disparaged subject. Stevenson's informants were 3000 children spontaneously remembering recent ordinary lives, as opposed to adults remembering under hypnosis romantic or heroic lives in the distant past. In addition, birthmarks that occur at the sites of injury in the previous life constitute an important part of Stevenson's evidence. Stevenson's methodology involved listening to stories, comparing and contrasting variants of stories, verification or falsification of empirical claims, and constructing long, detailed narratives that attempt to \"capture\" the complex experience of his informants, who claim to remember incidents from past lives. In this sense Stevenson's work is similar to that of ethnographers and cultural anthropologists. While Stevenson wrote extensively on his reincarnation studies, his work earned limited circulation outside academia. At the outset, Shroder sees his role not only as observer, but also as skeptic. But as his journey with Stevenson progresses, Shroder finds it increasingly difficult to reject the possibility of past lives."

  "text" : "Out Stealing Horses (Norwegian: Ut og stjæle hester) is a 2003 Norwegian novel by Per Petterson. It was translated into English in 2005 by Anne Born, published in the UK that year, and in the US in 2007. Among other awards it won the 2007 Dublin IMPAC Award, one of the richest literary prizes in the world. Out Stealing Horses has double meanings and two sets of twins. When asked “How did the Nazi Occupation of Norway translate into the plot of your novel?” Mr. Petterson responded “Well, like I said, I do not plan, so that double meaning came up when I needed it. That is disappointing to some readers, I know. But for me it shows the strength of art. It is like carving out a sculpture from some material. You have to go with the quality of the material and not force upon it a form that it will not yield to anyway. That will only look awkward. Early in the book, in the 1948 part, I let the two fathers (of my main characters, Jon and Trond) have a problem with looking at each other. And I wondered, why is that? So I thought, well, it’s 1948, only three years after the Germans left Norway. It has to be something with the war. And then I thought, shit, I have to write about the war. You see, I hate research.”"

The dictionary was created in order to meet the need for a more modern Latin-English dictionary than Lewis & Short's Latin Dictionary, while being less ambitious in scope than the unfinished Thesaurus Linguae Latinae. It was based on a new reading of classical sources, based on the advances in lexicography in creating the Oxford English Dictionary."

  "text" : "Odd Girl Out is a lesbian pulp fiction novel written in 1957 by Ann Bannon (pseudonym of Ann Weldy). It is the first in a series of pulp fiction novels that eventually came to be known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles. It was originally published in 1957 by Gold Medal Books, again in 1983 by Naiad Press, and again in 2001 by Cleis Press. Each edition was adorned with a different cover. Not until 1983 did author Ann Bannon learn that her first novel was the second best-selling paperback of 1957. Bannon's original story submitted to Gold Medal Books was about events in a sorority, in which a subplot involved an affair two women were having. Her editor handed it back to her and told her to focus on the two women. When she returned to the editor, the book was published without changing a word of her second version, and it became Odd Girl Out. As Bannon explained in the 2001 edition forward, Gold Medal Press publishers had control over the cover art and the title. Bannon's publisher titled the book. Lesbian pulp fiction books usually showed suggestive art with obscure titles that hinted at what the subject matter was inside. Ann Bannon was inspired to write her books after reading Spring Fire by Vin Packer and The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall. In fact, it was Marijane Meaker (Vin Packer's real name) that Bannon wrote to and who introduced her to her publisher at Gold Medal Books. Bannon was 22 years old when she began writing Odd Girl Out."

It is one of the most influential writings in Libertarian social thought and critique of statist ideology and socialism, examining the rise of Nazism as an example. The book treats Nazism as a species of orthodox socialist theory.

The book was made available online by the Ludwig von Mises Institute in 2004."

It is about a Jewish boy named Felix, who lived in Poland, and is on a quest to find his book-keeper parents after he sees Nazis burning the books from a Catholic orphanage library in which he stays. He finds a girl called Zelda in a burning house with her dead parents—he takes her with him and protects her from confronting her parents' death by telling her stories. Although Once is a work of fiction, Gleitzman was inspired by the story of Janusz Korczak, the events of World War II, and Hitler's attempt to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe. Once was translated into German (Einmal) and was nominated for the 2010 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis; it won the 2011 Katholischer Kinder- und Jugendbuchpreis. The sequels to the book are Then (2009), Now (2010), After (2012), and Soon (2015). In chronological order, the books are Once, Then, After, Soon, and Now."

  "text" : "On the Marble Cliffs (Auf den Marmorklippen) is a novella by Ernst Jünger published in 1939 describing the upheaval and ruin of a serene agricultural society. The peaceful and traditional people, located on the shores of a large bay, are surrounded by the rough pastoral folk in the surrounding hills, who feel increasing pressure from the unscrupulous and lowly followers of the dreaded head forester. The narrator and protagonist lives on the marble cliffs as a botanist with his brother Otho, his son Erio from a past relationship and Erio's grandmother Lampusa. The idyllic life is threatened by the erosion of values and traditions, losing its inner power. The head forester uses this opportunity to establish a new order based on dictatorial rule, large numbers of mindless followers and the use of violence, torture and murder. The tale may readily be understood as a parable on national socialism, the evil and \"jovial\" head forester being Hermann Göring. Others see it as a description of Germany's fight against the threat of Stalinism or communism, the head forester (or \"chief ranger\") being Joseph Stalin. Following this interpretation the book would have predicted in 1939 the ultimate failure of Germany's imminent war against the Soviet Union. The book was not censored in Nazi Germany, perhaps due to Jünger's significant repute in right-wing circles. Its sharp disapproval of violent masses, as well as its prediction or description of death camps, was noted and helped Jünger's rehabilitation after the Second World War although he had not gone into exile like most anti-Nazi authors. Jünger himself, however, refused the notion that the book was a statement of resistance, describing it rather as a \"shoe that fits various feet\". The work is typical for Jünger's Aestheticism that responds to destruction with placidity. It displays the determination to conserve values even in the face of annihilation, perhaps all the more so because the victory of the mindless masses follows brutalization as a virtual force of nature."

  "text" : "Oakfield; or, Fellowship in the East is a novel by William Delafield Arnold, first published in 1853. The book is one of the earliest novelistic accounts of life in British India, and its plot strongly mirrors the biography of its author. Set in India in the years surrounding the First Afghan War, the novel describes the unhappy experiences of the eponymous Edward Oakfield, an Oxford graduate who, we are told, enlisted in the East India Company's military service because he had grown tired of the metaphysical debates dominating that university. In India, Oakfield is repelled by what he sees as an absence of Christian gentlemanliness among the Company's military officers, and he soon retreats to introspection and the comradeship of a few, thinly spread, kindred spirits."

  "text" : "Once Upon a Time in the North, a fantasy novella by Philip Pullman (first published on 3 April 2008 in the United Kingdom) functions as a prequel to Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. The premise of the story involves the meeting of Iorek Byrnison and Lee Scoresby — an incident originally expected to appear in The Book of Dust: I've just finished a short book which will be coming out next spring, probably March or April in this country. It's called Once Upon A Time in the North, and it's about Lee and Iorek. When we see them for the first time with Lyra, Lee is not that old; he's fifty, sixty, something like that, so they know each other for a long time. But I wanted to write a story when they first met as they were young, and I've just written it. I'm making a little book like Lyra's Oxford with extra-bits. I've just been working on it, on a game, a game-board. It's going to be part of that book.— Philip Pullman Pullman has remarked that in addition to Once Upon a Time in the North and The Book of Dust, a small green book about Will may appear some day: Lyra's Oxford was a dark red book. Once Upon a Time in the North will be a dark blue book. There still remains a green book. And that will be Will's book. Eventually...— Philip Pullman The Guardian carried an \"exclusive\" extract from the book under the heading Winds of Chance on 22 March 2008. The book launch took place on 31 March in Oxford during the Oxford Literary Festival. Over 700 fans massed in Oxford Town Hall to hear Philip Pullman speak to Today programme presenter James Naughtie about his new novella."

  "text" : "On Being a Pagan, originally published in French under the title Comment peut-on être païen? (\"How can one be a pagan\"), is a book by the French philosopher Alain de Benoist. Originally published in 1981, it was first published in English in 2004. The book is a detailed and in-depth critique of the metaphysical and ethical concepts of Judeo-Christian tradition that have been influencing the Western culture over the past two thousand years. De Benoist details how many of these religious concepts have, over time, transformed into secular concepts and thinking, which in turn have had a great impact on Western ideologies, philosophies and attitudes. He traces the thinking of both Marx and Freud to their Judeo-Christian origins, and theorizes that racial intolerance, among other things, might have its roots in monotheistic thinking. In On Being a Pagan de Benoist argues for the return to the ideals of European Paganism as a cure for the current malaise of the Western society. The English edition of the book includes a preface by Stephen Edred Flowers."

Driver greatly prized the flag and ensured its safety from the Confederates, who attempted to seize the flag during the American Civil War. After the war, Driver's daughter and niece feuded over which of them owned the original Old Glory. In 1922, both flags claimed to be the original \"Old Glory\" became part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, where they remain today at the National Museum of American History."

  "text" : "Len Deighton's Only When I Larf is a late 1960s British comic thriller describing the activities of a team of three confidence tricksters led by Silas Lowther (late 40s), his girlfriend Liz Mason (late 20s) and wannabe apprentice and Liz-worshipper Bob (early 20s). It was published in 1968 by Michael Joseph and in paperback by Sphere. It is currently (2012) printed by Harper in the UK. The novel interleaves first-person narratives from Bob (76 pages in 7 chapters), Liz (78 pages in 6 chapters) and Silas (88 pages in 5 chapters). Their increasingly contradictory descriptions of shared experiences contribute to the humour. This unreliable narration adds to the atmosphere around deceiving \"the marks\", but the characters' different perspectives on their mutual relationship (interspersed with Silas's day-dreams of a dishonourable wartime incident) look more like self-deception and often add a poignant note. The title is explained in a variety of unlikely anecdotes where in each case a critically injured third party bravely replies this when asked \"Does it hurt?\""

  "text" : "On Thermonuclear War is a book by Herman Kahn, a military strategist at the RAND Corporation, although it was written only a year before he left RAND to form the Hudson Institute. It is a controversial treatise on the nature and theory of war in the thermonuclear weapon age. In it, Kahn addresses the strategic doctrines of nuclear war and its effect on the international balance of power. Kahn introduced the Doomsday Machine as a rhetorical device to show the limits of John von Neumann's strategy of mutual assured destruction or MAD. The book helped popularize the term megadeath, which Kahn coined in 1953. Kahn's stated purpose in writing the book was \"avoiding disaster and buying time, without specifying the use of this time.\" The title of the book was inspired by the classic volume On War, by Carl von Clausewitz. Widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain—the book sold 30,000 copies in hardcover—it is noteworthy for its views on the lack of credibility of a purely thermonuclear deterrent and how a country could \"win\" a nuclear war."

Essentially a linked group of short stories, it recounts the colonisation of the planet Rustum, a fictional terrestrial world orbiting Epsilon Eridani, by a group of refugees from an authoritarian planet Earth bearing some resemblance to the historical Pilgrim Fathers. Although habitable, Rustum's atmospheric pressure is so great that only its mountains and high plateaus are suitable for human settlement. The novel, like much of Anderson's work, has a libertarian subtext as the colonists flee the oppression on their home planet."

The book, written in the satirical paper's editorial voice, contains entries for nearly every country on Earth, including detailed maps, feature articles, and humorous stereotyped descriptions of regional history and customs. For example, Romania's entry is subtitled, \"Bram Stoker's Romania.\" There are eight distinct sections of the atlas. In order, North America, South America, Africa, Middle East, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Extra. Included in the Extra section are the Northern and Southern Poles and Greenland, which is \"larger than Africa and South America combined.\" The visual style of the book has been compared to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness series. The book uses faux xenophobia to illustrate the cultural differences of various nations, often mocking racial stereotypes with satirical comments. Each section contains \"facts\" about the nation, a brief history, and other information. Elements of the book have been transferred to an electronic format available on the paper's website and as a layer on Google Earth. Our Dumb World is also available as an audio book."

The book looks at the notion of being a \"genius\" and through discussions with 20th-century scientists explores the extent to which the great scientists of history were geniuses. The book's title is taken from Newton's 1675 quote: \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\""

  "text" : "Owen Glendower: An Historical Novel by John Cowper Powys was first published in America in January 1941, and in the UK in February 1942. Powys returned to Britain from the USA in 1934, with his lover Phyllis Playter, living first in Dorchester, where he began Maiden Castle. However, in July, 1935 they moved to the village of Corwen, Denbighshire, North Wales, historically part of Edeirnion or Edeyrnion, an ancient commote of medieval Wales that was once part of the Kingdom of Powys, where he completed Maiden Castle (1936). This move to the land of his ancestors led Powys to write this, the first of two historical novels set in this region of Wales; the other was Porius (1951). Owen, Powys's ninth novel, reflects \"his increasing sense of what he thought of as his bardic heritage.\" Powys has used Shakespeare's anglicised version of Owain Glyndŵr's name, \"Owen Glendower\" for the title of his novel. However, within the novel, he uses Owen Glyn Dŵr (sic) (most often just Owen). He also refers to Glyndŵr, as \"Owen ap Griffith\" or \"son of Griffith Fychan\" (Welsh: Owain ap Gruffydd)"

The work was issued in four volumes in print and online in the Oxford Digital Library. The encyclopedia is devoted to global maritime history and contains some 1.6 million words in more than 950 articles written by more than 400 authors in nearly 50 different countries. In summarizing its contents, Oxford University Press states that The Encyclopedia covers the entire history of seafaring, from ancient Egyptian shipbuilders to the nuclear submarines and supertankers of today. Over nine hundred articles written by leading historians examine all aspects of maritime history, including naval history, shipbuilding, biographies of major figures, navigation and scientific instrumentation, maritime art and literature, commerce and economics, and international law. Placing maritime affairs in their larger historical context, the Encyclopedia shows how seafaring has both reflected and influenced the major economic, cultural, military, and political developments in world history."

It is the first book in The Wingfeather Saga series, and is followed by North! Or Be Eaten, The Monster in the Hollows, and The Warden and the Wolf King. On The Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness is about three siblings, Janner, Tink and Leeli Igiby, their mother, Nia Igiby, their ex-pirate grandfather, Podo Helmer, and the Fangs of Dang. The Fangs lizard-like conquerors of the Igiby family's country whose lives' purpose seems to be to make keep all the humans in the land of Skree, where the Igiby family lives, miserable and unable to fight back, and who serve a mysterious person called Gnag the Nameless. Janner is the determined oldest brother, who Nia and Podo expect to protect the others. Tink is constantly hungry, and ready for mischief with his brother, such as exploring in the nearby dangerous woods. Leeli is kind, and musically talented, and crippled, but can be surprisingly fast when she has to be and kicks one of the feared Fangs of Dang to save her dog, Nugget. Nia is reluctant for most of the first book to tell what she used to do before she had children, or to tell the children anything about their father. The paperback book contains two maps, several illustrations, and appendices including poems and same of the Fangs' bureaucratic forms, all by Peterson. The fifty-one chapter book has three short prologues, describing the different countries and well as an anecdote about how the world got its name. The author uses humorous footnotes as an aid to his storytelling throughout."

Speaking of the Chinese side of her family, See has said: \"Things were so fractured and wild at home ... But the weekends with my grandparents became the real center for me ... It was the side of the family I identified more with. It was fun, romantic, solid\". The book has inspired both an opera, and a museum exhibition.

It is published by Hodder & Stoughton in Britain under the title McGee on Food and Cooking: An Encyclopedia of Kitchen Science, History and Culture. The book provides a reference to the scientific understanding and preparation of food. It has been described by Alton Brown as \"the Rosetta stone of the culinary world\", Daniel Boulud has called the book a \"must for every cook who possesses an inquiring mind\", while Heston Blumenthal has stated it is \"the book that has had the greatest single impact on my cooking\". The work is separated into sections that focus on the ingredients, providing the structure for the author to speculate on the history of foodstuffs and cookery, and the molecular characteristics of food flavors, while the text is illustrated by charts, graphs, pictures, and sidebar boxes with quotes from sources such as Brillat-Savarin and Plutarch. The book advises on how to cook many things (e.g., for pasta use abundant water, avoid hard water, add salt and a little oil to water, use slightly acidic water, with reasons and the science behind everything) and includes a few historical recipes (e.g., Fish or Meat Jelly, by Taillevent in 1375,), but no modern recipes as such."

It gives a light-hearted account of his walking the full length of the Pennine Way in 21 days, from Edale in Derbyshire to Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders. The book has a foreword by Mike Harding and illustrations by Gray Jolliffe. The book opens with an author's note: \"If this book should in some small way encourage people to take up walking themselves, then the author suggests they read the book again more carefully\". It includes humorous tales of the people he met on the route, his overnight stops primarily at Youth Hostels and the toll it took on his body. A glossary of \"Difficult Technical Terms\" is also included, for example \"Compass - instrument for establishing you are lost\". The book's title refers to that of the well-known television series One Man and His Dog, which features sheepdog trials, often in the Pennines and other upland areas."

  "text" : "Only A Theory: Evolution and the Battle for America's Soul is a 2008 book by the American cell biologist and Roman Catholic Kenneth R. Miller. In the book, Miller examines the battle between evolution and intelligent design (ID), and explores the implications of science in America. The title of the book comes from a misconception of what \"theory\" means in the context of science and evolution. Glenn C. Altschuler reviewed the book saying \"Though I.D. trumpets its connections to information theory, biochemistry and molecular biology, Miller concludes, as did Judge John Jones in Kitzmiller v. Dover, it rests, ultimately, on ignorance. Extending an olive branch to religious Americans, Miller suggests that evolution and faith aren't really in conflict because all of nature is part of God's providential plan.\" Biologist PZ Myers wrote \"Miller is a fine writer who sharply addresses the details of the arguments about intelligent design creationism. When tackling old chestnuts such as the 'only a theory' complaint, or Michael Behe's argument for a maximum limit for the number of genetic mutations, or William Dembski's rehash of William Paley's watchmaker argument for complexity, Miller discusses the contemporary biological explanations while refuting the errors.\" A number of reviewers have pointed out a single factual inaccuracy in the book: on page 149, Miller refers to the Dingo as a marsupial, when in fact Dingos are feral dogs. In his list of errata, published online, Miller gives a correct reading of the passage: \"It produced hunter-predator marsupials like the dingo and the Tasmanian tiger,\" should read \"It produced hunter-predator marsupials like the tiger quoll and the Tasmanian wolf.\" On June 16, 2008 Miller was interviewed on The Colbert Report discussing the book."

  "text" : "One is a dystopian novel by David Karp first published in 1953. It was also published under the title, Escape to Nowhere. Set in an unspecified time in the future in an unspecified Americanized country, One depicts a society on its way to a self-proclaimed perfection which consists in dissension having been rooted out and every citizen identifying his or her own interests with those of the \"benevolent State\". In order to achieve this aim, an enormous state apparatus has devised a sophisticated system of surveillance, subtle forms of re-education and, if necessary, brainwashing. The novel describes one such instance, where a man who believes himself to be an active supporter of the system is found guilty of \"heresy\" by the authorities and accordingly is held captive and receives the State's routine treatment for his allegedly deviant behaviour. The major part of One details the various stages and methods of his re-education process, while the book's focus lies not only on the reactions of the tortured but also on the thoughts and considerations of his torturers."

  "text" : "On the Mountain is Thomas Bernhard’s first prose work, which he completed in 1959, yet the last of his works to be published, in 1989, the year of his death. Based on autobiographical elements which constitute a kind of encyclopaedic view of Bernhard's world, this book gives a rare insight into the birth of a remarkable literary oeuvre paralleling that of Kafka and of Beckett. In fact, Sophie Wilkins, in her interesting Afterword, compares it to Kafka's short story \"Description of a Struggle\". Written as one sentence, it is a monologue delivered by a court reporter who meets a variety of characters, among whom are a secondary school teacher - the only intellectual - an innkeeper, and various ladies who afford him favours or bully and humiliate him. His only true attachment is to his filthy dog. The dog is a dirty, smelly body detested by the housekeeper who wants him and his owner out, but it's precisely this indubitable physical reality of him that makes him indispensable; without it, there's no real life in his life, and therewith no ideas, no literature that means anything. On the Mountain is a special kind of prose: relieved of its function as a carrier of common information,it presents itself as some such medium as poetry, music, painting, sculpture. The seemingly random notes of this book, its disjunct, diffuse mutterings are the vehicle for a dramatic conflict between an embattled life force intent upon self-creation, self-definition, saying \"All this is only a preparation for becoming me,\" and its equally determined opposition, threatening to make nonsense of all that. A real sickness-unto-death is made into a fulcrum for survival in an arena which is the human condition understood as a condition of immitigable deadlock."

  "text" : "Outliers: The Story of Success is the third non-fiction book written by Malcolm Gladwell and published by Little, Brown and Company on November 18, 2008. In Outliers, Gladwell examines the factors that contribute to high levels of success. To support his thesis, he examines the causes of why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in the first few months of the calendar year, how Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates achieved his extreme wealth, how The Beatles became one of the most successful musical acts in human history, how Joseph Flom built Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom into one of the most successful law firms in the world, how cultural differences play a large part in perceived intelligence and rational decision making, and how two people with exceptional intelligence, Christopher Langan and J. Robert Oppenheimer, end up with such vastly different fortunes. Throughout the publication, Gladwell repeatedly mentions the \"10,000-Hour Rule\", claiming that the key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours. The publication debuted at number one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background and the rest of the publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena."

  "text" : "Of Nightingales That Weep is a historical novel for children by Katherine Paterson, published by Crowell in 1974. Set in medieval Japan, the novel tells the story of Takiko, the 11-year-old daughter of a slain samurai warrior. Takiko’s mother remarries Goro, a gentle but unattractive potter/dwarf, whom Takiko fears. When she matures into adulthood, Takiko is able to find employment in the court of the Japanese emperor and falls in love with an enemy spy-Hideo. Eventually, she returns home and is able to reconcile her feelings towards Goro. Of Nightingales That Weep won the 1994 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. The award is named after the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity."

The novel is set in Chalatenango, El Salvador and follows the daily life of Guadalupe Guardado and the women of her family just prior to the Salvadoran Civil War. The book was banned by the government of El Salvador after its 1980 release for its descriptions of human rights violations by the Organización Democrática Nacionalista, the government's paramilitary intelligence organization. Argueta spent over 20 years exiled in Costa Rica following arrests for his involvement in political activity against the government. One Day of Life was published in 1980, the year of the beginning of the Salvadoran Civil War. One Day of Life was nominated by Modern Library as the fifth-best Latin American book of the 20th century. The conservative, pro-government Salvadoran newspaper El Diario de Hoy expressed doubt in the nomination. Other critics expressed disapproval of Argueta's novel being selected higher than popular writers like Ernesto Sabato and Alejo Carpentier."

  "text" : "Once Upon a Nightwish: The Official Biography 1996 – 2006 is a 2006 biography originally written in Finnish by Mape Ollila, telling the story of the first ten years of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. The book was translated into English in 2007. An enhanced, more polished English edition was published by Bazillion Points Books at the very end of 2008. Ollila tells the story of Nightwish from the very first ideas of a band in 1996 until the bombastic concert in Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, after which the lead singer Tarja Turunen was fired in an open letter by the band. The book is based on Ollila's own experiences with the band as well as exclusive interviews with the members, their families and their friends. The book is remarkable as a rock biography both because Ollila's portrayal is very sensitive to the subjects without sugar-coating their foibles, and because he was granted such full cooperation by a still-active band."

  "text" : "Ordinary Heroes is a narrative, nonfiction account of World War II as told through the perspective of veterans who served in various theatres of the conflict. Beginning with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and ending sometime after V-J Day, the book recounts the soldiers’ experiences at home and abroad, describing in detail what it was like to be at war. The stories are pulled from interviews conducted by the authors, which were verified and assembled into a timeline. Thus, the tales are presented chronologically as the war progresses. Stylistically, Ordinary Heroes resembles a novel, as it is written from a third-person limited perspective and often forgoes sweeping historical commentary in favor of internal dialogue and introspection. Its focus lies squarely upon the shoulders of the characters and their personal experiences. Of the sixty-plus men and women in the book, the majority are originally from – or currently reside in – Berks County, Pennsylvania, in the United States."

A murdered man is found among the dead rebels, a mystery for Brother Cadfael to solve, while two young men vie to be the Deputy Sheriff and vie for the lady's hand. When the novel was first published, the author was remarked for her knowledge of the historical era and ability to create it for the reader, yet \"she never lets the meticulously researched place-and-time interfere with the canny puzzle, the flesh-and-blood characterization, or the sharp tension.\""

  "text" : "Opening Night is a detective novel by Ngaio Marsh; it is the sixteenth novel to feature Roderick Alleyn, and was first published in 1951. It was published in the United States as Night at the Vulcan. The novel is one of the theatrical ones for which Marsh was best known, and concerns the murder of an actor backstage on opening night of a new play in London. The play is being performed at the Vulcan Theatre; it was formerly known as the Jupiter Theatre, renamed after an infamous murder recounted in the Alleyn short story \"I Can Find My Way Out\". The old crime is referenced in the text. Martyn Tarne, a young and inexperienced actress from New Zealand, finds herself involved in a play where her own heredity plays a significant role in a minor part. As the understudy for a minor role, Martyn is caught up when Inspector Roderick Alleyn begins investigating a murder made to appear a suicide. The book also sees the return of Lord Michael Lamprey. A child witness in A Surfeit of Lampreys (American title Death of a Peer), he was a civilian eager to join the police force in \"I Can Find My Way Out\", and he appears in Opening Night as a police constable attached to the CID. Opening Night was one of four Alleyn novels adapted for New Zealand television in 1977; Alleyn was played by George Baker."

  "text" : "Overqualified is an art project by Canadian writer Joey Comeau in which he wrote a series of cover letters as job applications to companies. The letters were collected into a book and published as Overqualified by ECW Press in 2009. The letters all start off as standard cover letters, but quickly turn very dark, and almost inevitably reveal the author to be mentally unstable. Excerpts from the book were included in the 2010 Best American Nonrequired Reading."

  "text" : "Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc. is a short essay written in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin. It was circulated by Franklin in manuscript to his circle of friends, but in 1755 it was published as an addendum in a Boston pamphlet on another subject. It was reissued ten times during the next 15 years. The essay examines population growth and its limits. Writing as, at the time, a loyal subject of the British Empire, Franklin argues that the British should increase their population and power by expanding across the Americas, taking the view that Europe is too crowded."

  "text" : "Orosa-Nakpil, Malate is a self-published novel by a student named Louie Mar Gangcuangco in 2006. The story revolves around Dave, a young medical student who frequently goes to Malate. In Barn, a bar that houses a dark room, he meets the men who entangle him in a web of love, vengeance, and sex. The information that Gangcuangco presents in this novel regarding the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV-AIDS) offers an entirely fresh approach to presenting factual, consistent and most recent scientific data, woven into a plot of romance, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness. In his narrative, Gangcuangco reiterates relevant issues about HIV-AIDS, especially men having sex with men, sustaining the interest of the reader in an erotic yet amusing and witty manner. Fallacies about the virus and advisories about safe sex are consistently reaffirmed amidst the compelling dialogues and discourses emanating from the many colorful and controversial characters of the novel."

The form of the dialogue is modelled on the De natura deorum and De divinatione of Cicero and its style is both vigorous and elegant if at times not exempt from something of the affectation of the age."

  "text" : "Oriental Magic, by Idries Shah, is a study of magical practices in diverse cultures from Europe and Africa, through Asia to the Far East. Originally published in 1956 and still in print today, it was the first of this author’s 35 books. The work was launched with the encouragement of the anthropologist, Professor Louis Marin, who in his preface to the book stressed its “scholarly accuracy” and “real contribution to knowledge”. Magic had long been considered outside the discipline of academic study, but Shah’s approach, which involved five years of study and field work, was – very unusually for the 1950s – multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural. His documented material came from archaeology, anthropology, history, religion, and psychology, as well as from artefacts, obscure manuscripts, and an impressive range of expert informants, who made (often unpublished) specialist material available to him. As a result, the secrecy and obfuscation around magical operations and practitioners was defused by the author’s informed, dispassionate approach to the array of arcane information he had assembled, some of it printed for the first time. Oriental Magic seems also to have been a clearly stated invitation for magic in general to be investigated as any other subject in the West would be, with coolness, objectivity and scientific method. The book in itself can be seen as providing a ground plan for future researchers, signalling useful directions their investigations might take, and specifying topics which might yield to further study."

In The New York Times Book Review, Donald Barr complained that the characters were marionettes; John Betjeman, in the Daily Telegraph, was even more critical: \"The book is written simply, but it is empty, and there is really nothing beyond its simplicity. It is neither real nor fantastic.\" Positive appraisal came from, for instance, Charles Poore, in The New York Times, who praises March's \"novel of salt and savor\" full of \"quiet, uninsistent irony\" and his \"mordant undertones of commentary on what it truly means to be an outcast.\""

  "text" : "Oberon Old and New or Oberon Past and Present is a book containing a new libretto written by Anthony Burgess in 1985 for Carl Maria von Weber's last opera Oberon (1826). The libretto was commissioned by Scottish Opera, and first used in Glasgow on 23 October 1985, in a performance conducted by Sir Alexander Gibson and directed by Graham Vick, with production design by Russell Craig. Although the composer was German, the original libretto by James Robinson Planché is also in English, and included in the book. Complaints about Planché's libretto have been common over the years, with Donald Tovey going so far as to call it a \"pig-trough\"; in performance it has usually been replaced with the German version by Theodor Hell. In August 2004, Scottish Opera staged several of Weber's operas, including Oberon (on 18 August), shortly before disbanding its chorus in order to meet budget cuts. However, Burgess's libretto was not used. One critic observed that: Perhaps not surprisingly, Scottish Opera has not volunteered to revive its 1985 production of Oberon at Edinburgh. This version was commissioned from the novelist Anthony Burgess, who not only replaced the archaic expressions and ersatz Shakespeare of Planché's original, but also updated the story to involve hijackers and hostages in a futuristic Middle East. A staging that parked an aeroplane on the roof of Glasgow's Theatre Royal on the opening night only seemed to sink the already preposterous plot further into the mire, although Burgess was so taken with the music that he went on to arrange the overture to Oberon for guitar quartet. A year later, Frank Dunlop, in the third of the Edinburgh Festivals he directed, created an imaginative semi-staging of the opera on a tilting disc erected on the platform of the Usher Hall."

  "text" : "The Oculus Sacerdotis was a 14th-century book by William of Pagula. Influenced by or possibly lifted from the Peckham Constitutions of 1281, they are divided into three volumes written between 1320 and 1323, the book sought to be a comprehensive manual for parish priests (many of whom were poorly educated), and covered the confessional, sacramental theology and preaching. Described as \"deep, all-encompassing and quite encyclopaedic\", sections of the book were in use up to the late Middle Ages, and approximately fifty copies are known still to exist in various libraries."

  "text" : "On Jungle Trails is a book-length compilation of Frank Buck’s stories describing how he captures wild animals. For many years, this book was a fifth grade reader in the Texas public schools, approved for state-wide use. Some of the facts Buck relates are observational, such as his description of the pangolin, a scaly anteater, getting his fill of red ants. Among the other accounts: \n*  Buck describes the capture of a man-eating tiger (the only one, he explains, which was ever brought to America , the Man-eater of Johore); \n*  Buck traps a rare clouded leopard when, contrary to the usual leopard habit, the cat takes refuge in a tree; \n*  Buck writes of trapping elephants and crocodiles; \n*  Buck tells of seizing of \"the largest orangutan ever captured alive.\" Buck brought these animals back to America; but when he obtained several tiny Malaysian mouse deer, the smallest deer in the world, weighing two pounds, and made pets of them, a quarantine against ruminating animals made it impossible to bring them into the United States. Buck's writes of his jungle camp and his methods for feeding and caring for his animals. At the end of the book there is a partial list of animals which Buck brought back alive to America. In an appendix there are several pages of information about various Asian animals, reptiles and birds. Buck emphasizes his refusal to kill animals and his insistence on kindness to them.\"Wherever I go, children mention this book to me and tell me how much they learned about animals and the jungle from it,\" said Buck."

  "text" : "Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order is an essay by Robert Kagan which attempts to explicate the differing approaches that the United States and the nations of Europe take towards the conduct of foreign policy. Kagan argues that the two have different philosophical outlooks on the use of power, which are the natural consequence of the United States' possession of power and the Europeans' lack of it. Initially published in Policy Review magazine, the essay was widely read and the subject of extensive debate and commentary in both America and Europe. In terms of its impact, it was compared by reviewers to Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man, Samuel P. Huntington's The Clash of Civilizations, and even George Kennan's X Article. Of Paradise and Power was a bestseller in multiple countries. It was a New York Times bestseller for ten weeks. It was also a bestseller in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Canada. It has been translated into more than 25 languages."

  "text" : "Operation Dark Heart: Spycraft and Special Ops on the Frontlines of Afghanistan and the Path to Victory is a 2010 memoir by retired United States Army Reserve intelligence officer Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer. The book details Shaffer's five months in Afghanistan in 2003 as a civilian Defense Intelligence Agency officer. Before redactions, the book contained names of intelligence officers and described clandestine operations, including \"N.S.A.'s voice surveillance system.\" The United States Department of Defense went to extreme lengths in an attempt to censor information in the book after it had already been printed. U.S. Army Reserve reviewers suggested modest changes in the original manuscript in January 2010. St. Martin's Press planned an August 31, 2010 release. When the Defense Intelligence Agency read the manuscript and shared it with the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the United States Special Operations Command in July, they identified around 250 pages that they claimed contained classified information. The first, uncensored printing of 9,500 copies was purchased for $47,300 in early September and destroyed by the publisher at the request of the Pentagon. A second, censored printing was released in late September. However, because 60 to 70 unredacted advance copies were distributed, the contents of the censored passages are known. The Pentagon's attempt to keep the information secret has attracted more attention to the book and increased its sales. Shaffer sued the Department of Defense for the right to print an unredacted version in December 2010. In 2013, the Pentagon reversed its decision and declared 198 of 433 redactions to be properly declassified. A U.S. District judge ruled in April 2015 that Shaffer's public testimony to Congress in 2006 was permissible to be included in the book in any subsequent printing. However, the judge ruled other information in the original manuscript was properly classified and not allowed to be included. This included the unredacted version of the narrative from Shaffer's Bronze Star Medal. The book also contains Shaffer's allegations that the DIA's Able Danger program identified hijacker Mohamed Atta before the September 11 attacks."

  "text" : "Opera (Italian: [ˈɔːpera]; English plural: operas; Italian plural: opere [ˈɔːpere]) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. Opera is part of the Western classical music tradition. It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his \"reform\" operas in the 1760s. In the 2000s, the most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), a landmark in the German tradition. The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer. The mid-to-late 19th century was a \"golden age\" of opera, led and dominated by Richard Wagner in Germany and Giuseppe Verdi in Italy. The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), Neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and Minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. In 2009, an opera company offered an online download of a complete performance."

  "text" : "One Nation Under Surveillance: A New Social Contract to Defend Freedom Without Sacrificing Liberty  is a book by Simon Chesterman, Dean and Professor at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law. Oxford University Press published the book in March 2011. It examines what limits — if any — should be placed on a government's efforts to spy on its citizens in the name of national security. Advance praise included a quote from former CIA Inspector-General Frederick Hitz: \"This book squarely faces the taboo subject of domestic privacy in an era of Islamist terrorism. Our enemies are not nation-states, so the targets of the intelligence services seeking to pre-empt terrorist attacks must be individuals. The casualty will be individual privacy. People will struggle against heightened surveillance, Chesterman notes, 'but the war will be lost.'\" Gareth Evans, president emeritus of Crisis Group and former Foreign Affairs Minister of Australia has written: \"This is an important book, breaking new ground in the sweep of its analysis, its analytical insights, and the policy implications it draws out. It shows just how often foreign and domestic intelligence gathering in the major democracies has been insensitive to public accountability, legality, and its consequences for individuals, to the detriment of both liberty and security--and how this can and must change. Simon Chesterman writes, as always, with compelling clarity and authority.\" Writing in the New York Review of Books, David D. Cole observed that Chesterman \"argues convincingly that the specter of catastrophic terrorist attacks creates extraordinary pressure for intrusive monitoring; that technological advances have made the collection and analysis of vast amounts of previously private information entirely feasible; and that in a culture transformed by social media, in which citizens are increasingly willing to broadcast their innermost thoughts and acts, privacy may already be as outmoded as chivalry.\""

  "text" : "Once an Eagle is a 1968 war novel by American author Anton Myrer. A #1 New York Times Bestseller, Once an Eagle has been a favorite of American military men and women since its writing. The novel tells the story of Sam Damon, career Army officer, from his initial enlistment to his rise to general officer rank. Myrer wrote his novel to warn against ambition without principle and the military-industrial complex. Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale are the vehicles for this warning. Damon is an honorable soldier who rises in rank by success in field command. He is a soldier of character with his men's welfare in mind. Massengale has no honor and rises in rank through staff positions by cunning and political connections. He is driven by lust for power and cares nothing for the welfare of soldiers. A television mini-series based on the book was aired on NBC in 1976, with actor Sam Elliott portraying Sam Damon. The book appears on the Commandant's required reading list for all First Lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps, and frequently serves as a text for cadets in leadership classes at West Point."

It has since gone on to garner millions of unique views over several original series shot in places like New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton. In 2010 OJTJ was published as a paperback book by Villard. Written by Sam Hoffman with Eric Spiegelman, it is subtitled 5000 Years of Funny Bits and Not-So-Kosher Laughs.\" Its chapters consist of jokes and humorous anecdotes contributed by several Jewish personalities, including Ed Koch, Norman Stiles, John Pleshette and Annie Korzen. In the introduction Hoffman says his book \"categorized the jokes into chapters, roughly tracing the trajectory of the Jewish experience in America\".In addition to the book, the OJTJ series has also been distributed on DVD, as two audio books (narrative and \"the joke-off\"), a successful BBC Four television series  and was named one of the Top 5 podcasts on iTunes in 2010. In 2011 OJTJ won an Audie Award for Humor. In May 2012, OJTJ opened as an off-broadway play at the Westside Theater. The BBC adapted the format for Some People With Jokes."

It consists of a preface and three interrelated essays that expand and follow through on concepts Nietzsche sketched out in Beyond Good and Evil (1886). The three Abhandlungen trace episodes in the evolution of moral concepts with a view to confronting \"moral prejudices\", specifically those of Christianity and Judaism. Some Nietzsche scholars consider Genealogy to be a work of sustained brilliance and power as well as his masterpiece. Since its publication, it has influenced many authors and philosophers."

  "text" : "Once More* With Footnotes is a book by Terry Pratchett, published by NESFA Press in 2004 when he was the Guest of Honor for Noreascon Four, the 62nd World Science Fiction Convention. It contains a mixture of short stories, articles, introductions to other books, and speeches, including his first published short story, \"The Hades Business\". The initial run is a limited edition hardback, consisting of 2,500 copies. It had two additional printings in hardback and is currently out of print. The book has a notable discrepancy: the front cover gives the title with two asterisks (the result of the cover design.) The title page has no asterisks, the press release and the Publisher's product page have one asterisk. The title is a reference to the phrase \"once more, with feeling\" and to Pratchett's frequent use of footnotes in his Discworld series, along with the brief author commentary at the start of each piece; the book itself actually contains very few footnotes. One of NESFA's working titles for the book was \"Oh Bugger, by Wossname\". All works contained within 'Once More* With Footnotes' were later published in two anthologies, A Blink of the Screen (2012), a collection of short fiction, and A Slip of the Keyboard (2014), a collection of non-fiction."

Mapanje, in his introduction to the work, describes as the result of the work of \"ten turbulent years\". The 'chameleon' of the title refers to the disguise of personal voice he deemed necessary in order to mount a criticism of the politics at the time. Of Chameleons and Gods is divided into four sections: \"Of Chameleons and Gods\", '\"Sketches from London\", \"Re-entering Chingwe's Hole\" and \"Assembling Another Voice\". The sections are almost chronological: poems in \"Sketches from London\"were written between 1972 and 1975; those in \"Re-entering Chingwe's Hole\", on Mapanje's return from London between 1975 and 1978; and those in \"Assembling Another Voice\" were probably the last to be written'."

  "text" : "The novel began as a short story written by Wolfe in 1965. He submitted the story to Damon Knight, who suggested that Wolfe expand it into a novel. Wolfe completed the novel, then titled The Laughter at Night in 1967, and sold it to Berkley Books. Wolfe and his editor, Donald R. Bensen, cut about 20% of the manuscript's 100,000-word length for publication. Operation Ares depicts a dystopian future, with the United States controlled by an anti-technological leftist regime. The story traces protagonist John Castle's conflict with the government and his increasing involvement with a rebellion backed by a Martian colony which has severed its ties to the U.S. government. While occasionally cited as a libertarian text, Wolfe himself attributes its politics to his being \"much more a doctrinaire conservative when I was a good deal younger."

He uses Biblical examples, such as how Moses coped with being denied entrance to The Promised Land, as well as secular examples, such as how Abraham Lincoln coped with depression. The emphasis is on the common disappointments faced by many throughout life, such as the breakup of a marriage, death of a loved one, loss of a job, or financial reversals. Rabbi Kushner's book was a New York Times bestseller for many months in the \"nonfiction\" category."

The album of 106 pages appeared in quarto size in cream boards and brown cloth spine, with a colour illustration of a broad-tailed paradise-whydah pasted on the front board. A companion volume titled Our South African Flora was published at the same time and was edited by Robert Harold Compton, director of the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in Cape Town. The printing and design of both albums was done by Cape Times Limited of Cape Town."

  "text" : "On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life is an essay regarding individual and societal freedom initially thought to have been written by the British philosopher John Stuart Mill, but later found to have been falsely attributed to him. Discovered in 1907 among the possessions left in the home at which Mill died in Avignon, France, it was published in June 1907 as a special article in The Oxford and Cambridge Review. The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing On Liberty, but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work Mill and His Early Critics. Rees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan: In September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled \"Social Freedom.\" Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of \"promise rather than performance\" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not \"to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence.\" Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he \"should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty.\" The letter is included in Mill's Collected Works where Edger is identified as \"probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of G.J. Holyoake in the promoting of the co-operative movement, writer for The Secular World and author of tracts on co-operation.\" Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in The History of Co-operation: \"Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be \"manly, open, and ingenious appearance,\" beyond what he expected of one belonging to the \"depressed\" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:-\"I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell'). I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm. There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only bounty of the squire towards poor neighbours. (1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish.(2) Each member can hold only one share.(3) Members have no voice in the management.(4) Wages to workmen same as usual.(5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders. The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant.It has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way. Remember, I only give my impressions.\" An E.R. Edger is also listed in The British Medical Journal on the 24th of April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England."

  "text" : "On China is a 2011 non-fiction book by the former United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. Kissinger, one of the most famous diplomats of the 20th century, is well known for the role he played in Sino-American relations during the Nixon administration and in particular the 1972 Nixon visit to China. Thus, his book focuses on Chinese history through the lens of foreign policy considerations, and in particular his own brand of realpolitik. It focuses on how Sino-Soviet border clashes forced China to consider a new opening of relationship with the United States. The book also discusses the complex decision-making of chairman Mao Zedong during the Taiwan Strait Crisis. The preliminary negotiations began through the ambassadorial levels in Warsaw, Bucharest and through Yahya Khan in Pakistan. In addition to pure history and discussion of foreign policy, the work is also something of a personal narrative of Kissinger's experiences in China, and in that respect is a memoir intended to bolster positive perceptions of his expertise and influence when it comes to Chinese-American relations."

The publication of the chronicles started in the February, No.2, 1869 issue of The Russian Messenger magazine, when Part 3 of it came out, under the title The Small People of Plodomasovo. Scenes From the Life of Old Russia. Then parts one, Boyarin Nikita Yurievich, and two, Boyarynya Marfa Andreevna, came out in Nos. 6,7 and 8,9 respectively, of the Syn Otechestva magazine. The Stories by M.Stebnitsky (1869) collection featured the Old Times in Plodomasovo under the title Three Studies, the third one being preceded by the author's commentary: \"This one follows a large gap in the Plodomasovo chronicles, for three sketches on old years of Plodomasova and dvoryanin Tuganov's life were not included for some reasons. The following Study relates to the period when Marfa Andreevna has already been dead, the story of her later years is being told by her favourite 'midget' Nikolai Afanasievich. In 1872 The Small People of Plodomasovo were published again (with changes made in the text) as part of The Cathedral Clergy (The Russian Messenger, 1872, May), chapters II-IV of the Second Chronicle."

  "text" : "Oromay (an Eritrean Tigrinya word meaning 'it is pointless', borrowed from the Italian oramai) is an Amharic-language novel, published in 1983. It was written by Baalu Girma. The novel presents a cynical account on the Red Star Campaign of the Derg military junta. The book was published by the Kuraz Publishing Agency in Addis Ababa. In spite of a government ban on the book, it became widely read and famous. According to Ruth Iyob, the book presents 'an accurate and compelling account of the events surrounding the failure of this campaign'. The Red Star Campaign had been declared by Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam in a speech in Asmara on January 25, 1982. In his speech Mengistu called for the crushing of 'secessionist bandits', i.e. the EPLF guerrilla in Eritrea, the TPLF in Tigray and the EPRP and EDU in Gondar. The campaign was supposed to focus both on military means as well as supporting reconstruction in the affected areas. The Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia was assigned the task of leading the campaign. The government sent some 120,000 troops to participate in the campaign, making it the largest military offensive of the Derg in the Eritrean war. The author Baalu Girma, had been invited by Mengistu to work as propaganda chief in the Red Terror Campaign. He had assumed the position believing in the goals of the campaign. However, he came to feel that the ideals of the campaign had been corrupted by militaristic mindsets. Once the campaign had been abruptly called off, Baalu Girma began writing Oromay based on the events of the campaign. Whilst the official propaganda lauded the Red Star Campaign as a success, Baalu Girma considered it a failure. He stayed behind in Eritrea during this period. Oromay is a love story set in Asmara in the midst of the conflict. Baalu Girma changed the names of real-life Derg officials. Dawit Wolde Giorgis, then the head of COPWE in Asmara is depicted in the book as the character 'Solomon Betre-Giorgis'. Other real-life Derg officials depicted in the novel are Fisaha Geda (as Tedla Regassa, Chief of Protocol), Tesfaye Wolde-Selassie (as Betru Tesema) and Fasika Sidelel (as Mashafe Daniel). These were figures that Baalu Girma knew personally. According to Dawit Woldis-Giorgis it was obvious whom the fictional characters depicted. The Derg government is illustrated as corrupt and inefficient in the novel. However, the bulk of the book is dedicated to accounts of the war in Eritrea. In Oromay accounts of massacres and rapes committed by government militias in Eritrean villages are presented, as a consequence of the discourse equating all Eritreans with rebels. The book also deals with the real-world rumour that Tekle Gebre Mariam, an EPLF leader that had defected to the Derg, had been an EPLF double-agent. During this period it was extremely rare that literature presenting any form of criticism (even in mild forms) of the government could get past the official censors. According to Kinfe Abraham, the only reason Oromay could get published was a feud between Mengistu and Fikre Selassie. However, just 24 hours after its release the government banned the novel. All copies were removed from book shops. Confiscated copies of the book were turned into pulp at the Wenji sugar plant. Possession of the Oromay became dangerous, as owners were subjected to government harassment. But some 500 copies had already been sold before the ban had been issued and the book continued to be copied through xerox machines. Baalu Girma was fired from his job. Some months later he 'disappeared'. It is generally believed that his disappearance was linked to the publishing of Oromay."

The work has been praised by several scholars, but criticized by others, some of whom have attributed to Halperin the view that the coining of the word \"homosexuality\" in the nineteenth century brought homosexuality into existence."

  "text" : "Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath is a book by the former White House intern Mimi Alford in February 2012. It contains the autobiographical account of the woman who had an affair with U.S. President John F. Kennedy towards the end of his life (from June 1962 to July 1963). Despite its consuming influence over her life at the time, Alford managed to keep her involvement in the affair secret for nearly 50 years, until basic details were published in the 2003 Kennedy biography An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917–1963 by Robert Dallek. As described by the book jacket, \"Once Upon a Secret offers a new and personal depiction of one of our most iconic leaders and a powerful, moving story of a woman coming to terms with her past and moving out of the shadows to reclaim the truth.\" Alford describes how she was completely swept away by Kennedy, losing her virginity to him during the fourth day of her service as an intern in the White House Press Office. But she also describes her struggles to overcome the occasional disingenuous nature of her treatment by the president, as well as the progression of her own dawning realization and guilt she later felt about the inescapable part she played in his life, and he in hers. Besides the relationship with the president, she also describes her unhappy first marriage and the emptiness of it. According to the New York Times, \"Ms. Alford claims to be completely purged of guilt, grief and baggage by the cleansing process of acknowledging past mistakes. And she describes a happy new marriage.\" In terms of her defining such 'mistakes', however, the author's stated willingness to do again what she did, in the same circumstances, puts into perspective the genre of literature that her work represents, somewhat reminiscent of the media and publishing bonanza which followed reports of the relationship between US President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky. It was published in hardcover, paperback, and ebook editions, and has received widespread media attention including inclusion on several bestseller lists. Most notably, it has spent several weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List, the NPR Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller List, and the Los Angeles Times Bestseller List. The book was originally published in April 2011 by Hutchinson Radius. Mimi Alford currently lives in Massachusetts with her second husband."

  "text" : "\"Our Struggle\" was a pamphlet written late October 1945 by Indonesian independence leader Soetan Sjahrir. It was pivotal in redirecting the Indonesian national revolution. In his pamphlet Sjahrir addressed all crucial spearheads of the still ongoing revolutionary struggle for Indonesia’s independence. His target audiences are firstly and primarily the Indonesian masses and their leaders involved in the revolution, secondly public opinion in the colonial metropolis of the Netherlands, home of the adversary and thirdly international public opinion. The Dutch language editions of 1946 contain opening words by Perhimpoenan Indonesia and were used to sway Dutch public opinion during the Linggadjati negotiations. Its English translation was distributed at Westminster Hall to the British delegates to the United Nations. Sjahrir's writings successfully countered the myth that the Indonesian republic was the brainchild of the fascist imperial Japanese forces and not a deep national desire."

Some of the minor characters are introduced to the reader through Kuruppu, where he is shown to be in conversation about them with other prominent characters of the street.The street is based on the S.M. Street or popularly known as Mithai theruvu (Sweet Meat Street) in Kozhikode, Kerala. It won the Kerala Sahitya Academy Award of 1961."

  "text" : "Occupy is a short study of the Occupy movement written by the American academic and political activist Noam Chomsky. Initially published in the United States by the Zuccotti Park Press as the first title in their Occupied Media Pamphlet Series in 2012, it was subsequently republished in the United Kingdom by Penguin Books later that year. An academic linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky first achieved fame for his work as a political activist during the 1960s and 1970s. A libertarian socialist, Chomsky was a prominent critic of capitalism, the role of western media and the foreign policy of the U.S. government, dealing with such issues in bestsellers like Manufacturing Consent (1988), Hegemony or Survival (2003) and Failed States (2006). With the birth of the Occupy Movement – devoted to socio-political change – in 2011, Chomsky became a vocal supporter for the protesters, writing articles and giving speeches on their behalf, several of which were collected together and published as Occupy. The book opens with an introductory editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement and its potential for the greater democratization of society. This is followed by the text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. The third part of the book comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters. Throughout the book, Chomsky discusses what the Occupy movement is and what it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in which it could gain greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence. Press reviews were largely positive, with some noting that Chomsky had taken a more moderate, reformist position than they expected of him."

  "text" : "Othappu (English: Scandal or Temptation) is a Malayalam novel written by Sarah Joseph and published in 2005. The novel is the last in the trilogy which includes 'Alaahayude Penmakkal' and 'Mattathi'. While 'Mattathi' is a kind of sequel to 'Alaahayude Penmakkal', 'Othappu' follows the pattern by having a central female character and protagonist. The novel deals with the decision of a nun to step outside the convent and embrace a life free from the shackles of established religious norms and practices. In this, the character 'Marghalitha', comes in logger heads with the church and society which refuse to accept her personal views and individual freedom and expect her to conform to the framework in place regarding those joining the nunnery. The English translation of the book named 'Othappu: The Scent of the Other Side' won the Crossword Book Award for translation."

It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. It has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. It has no internal or external skeleton (although some species have a vestigial remnant of a shell inside their mantles), allowing it to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse of all invertebrates. Octopuses inhabit diverse regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the ocean floor. They have numerous strategies for defending themselves against predators, including the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and deimatic displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, and their ability to hide. They trail their eight arms behind them as they swim. All octopuses are venomous, but only one group, the blue-ringed octopus, is known to be deadly to humans. Around 300 species are recognized, which is over one-third of the total number of known cephalopod species. The term 'octopus' may also be used to refer specifically to the genus Octopus."

  "text" : "One Way Forward: The Outsider's Guide to Fixing the Republic is the seventh book by Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor and activist concerned about the excessive influence of corporate money in politics. One Way Forward describes his discussions with activists in the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street. He says the two groups have a lot in common, including a concern for the future of the US and a willingness to devote substantial amounts of time and possibly money to do what they think is likely to fix the worst of the problems. They also share a counterproductive tendency to label as \"treasonous\" anyone who suggests talking with the other side. Lessig says that together these different groups can fix the biggest problem facing the US today, namely the excessive influence of corporate money in politics, also called crony capitalism or corporate welfare. However, all sides must first find ways to listen to the others to find their common ground. Lessig hopes this book will help catalyze a needed rapprochement between different groups, encouraging them to listen to the others and find their common grounds. If they can do that, they can produce much needed change in the political economy of the US and possibly the world. To facilitate this, Lessig writes, \"After a short period, and assuming the book takes hold, I will license it freely, and based on the feedback (at oneway.lessig.org), draft version two. That second version will be licensed freely from the start, and will live on a wiki. That means that no single one of us will own it, but that all of us will be able to direct it.\""

The book is about faith, family and the Catholic Church in the 21st century. It was first published in Spanish in 2010 and appeared in an English translation in 2013. Among the comments that attracted particular attention following Bergolio's election to the papacy were these: For now the discipline of celibacy remains firm. Some say, with a certain pragmatism, we're losing manpower. If, hypothetically, Western Catholicism revises the issue of celibacy, I think it would be for cultural reasons (as in the East), not as a universal option. For the moment, I am in favor of maintaining celibacy, with the pros and cons it has, because there are 10 centuries of good experiences rather than failures.... It is a matter of discipline, not of faith. It can change."

  "text" : "Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well is a book of poems by American author Maya Angelou, published by Random House in 1975. It is Angelou's second volume of poetry, written after her first two autobiographies and first volume of poetry were published. Angelou considers herself a poet and a playwright, but is best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention. Oh Pray is divided into five parts and consists of 36 poems. The volume is dedicated to \"Paul\". Like many of Angelou's poems, the poetry in the volume has been characterized as light verse. They contain identifications with ordinary objects and universal identifications. Oh Pray has received mixed reviews from critics; one critic states that the poems in it are best if read aloud. They focus on themes of love, insight, and tension, and on overcoming difficulties. Angelou writes about ordinary objects and experiences, and with deep feelings, about a variety of racial themes and concerns."

As of 2001, over 6 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 13th on a list of \"All-Time Bestselling Children's Books\" from Publishers Weekly. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\""

  "text" : "Oeroeg (translated into English as \"The Black Lake\") is the first novel by Hella Haasse. First published anonymously in 1948, it has become one of the best-known Dutch novels and a staple of literary education for many Dutch school children. The novel, a Bildungsroman, is set in the Dutch East Indies, and tells the story of an anonymous narrator growing up on a plantation in the Dutch colony West Java. His childhood friend is a boy of the same age, but of native descent. As the narrator grows up he finds himself becoming estranged from his friend, as a result of the political and racial circumstances of colonial life. After having served in the army during World War II, he returns to his native land, only to be told that this is not where he belongs, and that he must leave."

  "text" : "Of True Religion, Heresy, Schism, Toleration; and what best means may be used against the Growth of Popery is the title of a polemical tract against the popery of the Roman Catholic Church written by John Milton which was published in London in 1673. The tract addresses Milton's own problems with the doctrines, practices, and ceremonies associated with the pope or the papal system of the Roman Catholic Church and, with what Milton called, the implicit faith of its members. The anti-Catholic ideas in Milton's writing are in direct response to the tolerant stance of King Charles II of England toward the Roman Catholic Church. Pro-Catholic sentiments had not been popular in England since the very bloody reign of the devout Roman Catholic queen Mary I of England. The obvious anti-Catholic ideas present in Milton's writing, coupled with Milton's own influence, may have inspired such social movements as the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the eventual passing of the Popery Act of 1698."

  "text" : "Our Man in Iraq (Croatian: Naš čovjek na terenu) is a novel by Croatian author Robert Perišić. It was originally published in Croatia, where it became a bestseller and received the Jutarnji list prize for best prose in 2007. The novel was also awarded the Literaturpreis der Steiermärkischen Sparkasse in 2011. Our Man in Iraq was translated into English by Will Firth and published in the United States on April 2, 2013 by Black Balloon Publishing in paperback and e-book formats. The Guardian called the English translation \"a must-read ... brilliantly captures modern-day Zagreb.\" It was also praised by Publishers Weekly as a \"smart, cutting book\" and by The Toronto Star as \"terrifically witty and original.\" The Times Literary Supplement compared the English translation to The Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek and Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut. Set in Zagreb during 2003, Our Man in Iraq follows Toni, a journalist who is besieged by his rural relatives with requests for work. Succumbing to his mother's nagging, Toni arranges for his cousin Boris to cover the ongoing U.S invasion of Iraq despite his lasting shell shock from the Croatian War of Independence. As Boris's reports from Iraq become increasingly strange, Toni secretly rewrites them until they cease coming in altogether and Boris goes missing. Toni is forced to keep Boris's disappearance from his family and his newspaper while negotiating his own romantic, cultural and professional hurdles in a nation that is awkwardly progressing from socialism to global capitalism."

For its first season, the series garnered 12 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, winning three. A new Emmy rule in 2015 forced the series to change categories from comedy to drama.

Orange Is the New Black is the first series to score Emmy nominations in both comedy and drama categories.

According to scholar Nicholas Liker, \"Olesya is the most charming of Kuprin's rural tales. Though meant at first to be only part of the Volhynia and Polesye cycle, this poetic story of the love between an urban intellectual and a beautiful country girl expanded into a full novelette of a significance far surpassing that of the other regional tales.\" The story was one of Kuprin's favorites. Referring once to both Olesya and his later work \"The River of Life,\" he said: \"There is life in it and freshness and... more of my soul than in my other tales.\""

Outlaw Pete is about a bank-robbing baby whose exploits become a meditation on sin, fate, and free will. According to Springsteen, \"Outlaw Pete is essentially the story of a man trying to outlive and outlast his sins.\" The story comes from many sources, including the many colorful characters on his album The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, every western he has seen since he was a kid and all the way back to bedtime stories of Brave Cowboy Bill his mother used to recite to him as a child."

The book provides an introduction to orbital mechanics, while assuming an undergraduate-level background in physics, rigid body dynamics, differential equations, and linear algebra. Topics covered by the text include a review of kinematics and Newtonian dynamics, the two-body problem, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, orbit determination, orbital maneuvers, relative motion and rendezvous, and interplanetary trajectories. The text focuses primarily on orbital mechanics, but also includes material on rigid body dynamics, rocket vehicle dynamics, and attitude control. Control theory and spacecraft control systems are less thoroughly covered. The textbook includes exercises at the end of each chapter, and supplemental material is available online, including MATLAB code for orbital mechanics projects."
