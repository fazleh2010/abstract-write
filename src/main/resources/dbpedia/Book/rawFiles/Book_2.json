  "text" : "2150 AD is a novel copyrighted by Don Plym and Thea (Alexander) Plym and originally published in 1971. In 1976 it was modified and re-published by Thea Alexander. The story concerns the character of Jon, who travels between his world of 1976 and the future world of 2150, where the Macro Society dominates the Earth. The world of 1976 is referred to by the inhabitants of 2150 as the pinnacle of micro society. This book is based on the journal of Jon Lake, who lived in the 1960s and 1970s as a psychiatrist. Because of his life experiences and accepting world view, his soul was considered evolved, or Macro, enough to travel to 2150 where his twin soul, Lea Nine, and soul mate, Carol Three lived. His astral form traveled to 2150 and he lived there while his 1970s body slept, and returned to the 1970s during his waking hours. The book is centered on Macro Philosophy and concepts such as reincarnation, karma, twin souls and soul mates, as well as macro and micro limitations. Thea Alexander started a workshop for studying Macro Philosophy shortly before the book was published; this information is on the back cover of the book."

  "text" : "20 Hrs. 40 Min.: Our Flight in the Friendship is a book written by pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart. It was first published in 1928 by G. P. Putnam's Sons, but has continued to be reprinted in periodic new editions. A special \"Author's Autograph Edition\" of 150 signed and numbered copies was also produced in 1928. Each copy of this special edition contained a miniature silk American flag carried by Earhart in her flight on the Friendship from Boston to Wales. In this book, Earhart writes about her experiences as a passenger in the Friendship, which made her the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air in 1928 (she later accomplished the feat in a solo flight). Earhart combines actual log entries made during the flight with recollections of her childhood and how she first became interested in aviation. Towards the end of the book, Earhart has a chapter entitled \"Women in Aviation.\" In this chapter she writes, Possibly the feature of aviation which may appeal most to thoughtful women is its potentiality for peace. The term is not merely an airy phrase. Isolation breeds distrust and differences of outlook. Anything which tends to annihilate distance destroys isolation, and brings the world and its' peoples closer together. I think aviation has a chance to increase intimacy, understanding, and far-flung friendships thus.20 Hrs. 40 Min. was the first of two books Earhart would write in her lifetime; the other being 1932's The Fun of It. A third book credited to her, Last Flight, was published posthumously and consisted of diary entries from her ill-fated 1937 flight around the world. National Geographic republished the work in 2003 under its National Geographic Adventure Classics imprint."

Nolen spent six years traveling through Africa to gather the stories. The stories range from orphans, a truck driver, a miner, and a grandmother raising her grandchildren alone in poverty, to college educated patients, military members, clergy, and even Nelson Mandela, whose son Makgatho died of AIDS. Stephen Lewis described the book as \"the best book ever written about AIDS, certainly the best I’ve ever read\"."

  "text" : "2666 is the last novel by Roberto Bolaño. It was released in 2004, a year after Bolaño's death. Its themes are manifold, and it circulates around an elusive German author and the unsolved and ongoing murders of women in Santa Teresa, a violent city inspired by Ciudad Juárez and its epidemic of female homicides. In addition to Santa Teresa, settings and themes include the Eastern Front in World War II, the academic world, mental illness, journalism, and the breakdown of relationships and careers. 2666 explores 20th-century degeneration through a wide array of characters, locations, time periods, and stories within stories. Over 1100 pages long in its Spanish edition, and almost 900 in its English translation, it is divided into five parts. An English-language translation by Natasha Wimmer was published in the United States in 2008, by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and in the United Kingdom in 2009, by Picador. Critical reception of the novel has, on the whole, been very positive. In Chile, it won the Altazor Award in 2005. The New York Times Book Review included it in the list of \"10 Best Books of 2008\"; Time named it Best Fiction Book of 2008; and the novel won the 2008 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. Wimmer's translation was nominated for the Best Translated Book Award. Critics have compared it to W. G. Sebald's work and praised the book's multiple story lines and scope."

The study evaluates the role which governments and other 'stakeholders' have taken to facilitate this transition. According to the report, \"The fundamental premise of the report and an analytical point of departure is that facilitating young people’s transition to adulthood by improving their health prospects, expanding education and employment opportunities, and providing opportunities for participation in all aspects of development is an essential precondition for achieving the inclusive, equitable societies...\".

The silent story is about a young working-class man who leads a revolt against his employer. The first of dozens of such works by Masereel, the book is considered to be the first wordless novel, a genre that saw its greatest popularity in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. Masereel followed the book in 1919 with his best-known work, Passionate Journey. Masereel had grown up reading revolutionary socialist literature, and expressed his politics in A Man's Passion; the work is also filled with religious imagery, as with the Common Man taking the role of the martyred Christ. It owed its visual style to Expressionism and mediaeval woodcuts. The book was popular, particularly in German editions, which had introductions by writers Max Brod, Hermann Hesse, and Thomas Mann."
