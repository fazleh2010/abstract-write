  "text" : "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values (ZAMM), first published in 1974, is a work of philosophical non-fiction, the first of Robert M. Pirsig's texts in which he explores his Metaphysics of Quality. The book sold 5 million copies worldwide. It was originally rejected by 121 publishers, more than any other bestselling book, according to the Guinness Book of Records. The title is an apparent play on the title of the book Zen in the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel. In its introduction, Pirsig explains that, despite its title, \"it should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice. It's not very factual on motorcycles, either.\""

  "text" : "Zodiac: An Eco-Thriller (1988) is a novel by American writer Neal Stephenson. His second novel, it tells the story of an environmentalist, Sangamon Taylor, uncovering a conspiracy involving industrialist polluters in Boston Harbor. The \"Zodiac\" of the title refers to the brand of inflatable motor boats the hero uses to get around the city efficiently. His opponents attempt to frame him as an ecoterrorist. The protagonist is inspired by environmental chemist Marco Kaltofen. Taylor is a recreational user of nitrous oxide, justifying his choice of drug by the eponymous Sangamon's principle: \"the simpler the molecule, the better the drug\". In the novel, Taylor is a chemist working for GEE, a fictional environmental activism group which stages both protests and direct actions plugging toxic waste pipes. Taylor becomes involved with Basco Industries, a fictional corporation which produced Agent Orange and is a major supplier of organic chlorine compounds. Basco experiments with genetic engineering to develop chemical producing microbes, driving Taylor's efforts to expose their crimes and preserve Boston Harbor. A number of the later events of the novel take place on Boston Harbor's Spectacle Island which at the time of publication was almost entirely composed of garbage. In the story it is frequented by drugged-out and reputedly Satanic groupies of the \"two-umlaut\" heavy metal music band, Pöyzen Böyzen, who are too intoxicated with angel dust to realize they are poisoning themselves with the toxic waste that was dumped there. Taylor's projects involve sampling the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls in Boston Harbor with the help of the Gallaghers, a fishing family who record the location of the lobsters they catch. While gathering evidence which GEE will use to expose Basco's crimes, Taylor is flummoxed by the fact that the toxins have suddenly disappeared. He eventually discovers that Basco has acquired a bioengineering firm, where his high school nemesis is employed as a genetic engineer, to create a bacterium that is able to digest toxins, cleaning up the harbor instantly. However, Basco had been forced to release the bacteria into the wild without full testing because of their imminent exposure by GEE. Depending on the equilibrium state of the harbor, the new bacteria is also able to create toxins. To stop Taylor meddling with their plans, Basco discredits him by planting a bomb in his house and framing him as a terrorist trying to assassinate their president. He escapes with the help of a Native American tribe and eventually returns in secret to steal one of their ships containing a large amount of toxins which they are planning to release into the ocean."

The task took 19 years to be completed, and, in 1084 AD, it was presented to his successor Emperor Shenzong of Song. The Zizhi Tongjian records Chinese history from 403 BC to 959 AD, covering 16 dynasties and spanning across almost 1,400 years, and contains 294 volumes (巻) and about 3 million Chinese characters."

  "text" : "Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness is a book authored by James H. Austin. First published in 1998, the book's aim is to establish links between the neurological workings of the human brain and meditation. The eventual goal would be to establish mechanisms by which meditation induces changes in the activity of the brain, which in turn induces a state of mental clarity. For example, Austin presents evidence from EEG scans that deep relaxed breathing reduces brain activity. The publishers described their book as a \"Comprehensive text on the evidence from neuroscience that helps to clarify which brain mechanisms underlie the subjective states of Zen, and employs Zen to 'illuminate' how the brain works in various states of consciousness\". The book starts with a discussion of Zen Buddhism, its goals, and practices. Having laid this groundwork, the book then turns to explore the neurological basis of consciousness. While the book stops short of conclusive theories, it does provide many testable hypotheses that could validate the discussion in the book. Austin is a neurologist and has also practiced Zen over many years. Later Austin wrote a follow-up, Zen-Brain Reflections."

  "text" : "Zuleika Dobson, full title Zuleika Dobson, or, an Oxford love story, is a 1911 novel by Max Beerbohm, a satire of undergraduate life at Oxford. It was his only novel, but was nonetheless very successful. This satire includes the famous line \"Death cancels all engagements\" and presents a corrosive view of Edwardian Oxford. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Zuleika Dobson 59th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The book largely employs a third-person narrator limited to the character of Zuleika (pronounced \"Zu-lee-ka\", not \"Zu-like-a\"), then shifting to that of the Duke, then halfway through the novel suddenly becoming a first-person narrator who claims inspiration from the Greek Muse Clio, with his all-seeing narrative perspective provided by Zeus. This allows the narrator to also see the ghosts of notable historical visitors to Oxford, who are present but otherwise invisible to the human characters at certain times in the novel, adding an element of the supernatural. Dr Robert Mighall in his Afterword to the New Centenary Edition of Zuleika (Collector's Library, 2011), writes: \"Zuleika is of the future.... [Beerbohm] anticipates an all-too-familiar feature of the contemporary scene: the D-list talent afforded A-list media attention.\" Beerbohm began writing the book in 1898, finishing in 1910, with Heinemann publishing it 26 October 1911. He saw it was not as a novel, rather \"the work of a leisurely essayist amusing himself with a narrative idea.\" Sydney Castle Roberts wrote a parody Zuleika in Cambridge (1941)."

  "text" : "Z for Zachariah is a post-apocalyptic science-fiction novel by Robert C. O'Brien that was published posthumously in 1974. The name Robert C. O'Brien was the pen name used by Robert Leslie Conly. After the author's death in 1973, his wife Sally M. Conly and daughter Jane Leslie Conly completed the book guided by his notes. Set in the United States, the story is in the form of a diary written from the first-person perspective of sixteen-year-old Ann Burden, who has survived a nuclear war and nerve gas through living in a small valley with a self-contained weather system. According to Sally Conly, Z for Zachariah was her husband's second novel intended for adults, following his 1972 science-fiction thriller A Report from Group 17. O'Brien had previously established himself as a children's writer with his novels The Silver Crown (1968) and Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). Z for Zachariah received a 1976 honor award from the Jane Addams Children's Book Award and the Edgar Award for the best mystery fiction in the juvenile category."

  "text" : "Muhammad Husayn Haykal's novel Zaynab (commonly pronounced [ˈzeːnæb]) is considered the first modern Egyptian novel, published in 1913. The full title in Arabic is زينب: مناظر واخلاق ريفية (\"Zaynab: Manazir wa'akhlaq rifiyyah,\" or \"Zaynab: Country Scenes and Morals\"). The book depicts life in the Egyptian countryside and delves into the traditional romantic and marital relationships between men and women and the interactions between the laboring cotton worker and plantation owner classes. The novel is a seminal event in Egyptian literature, since it was the first to feature a fully described, contemporary Egyptian setting and the first to feature dialogue in the Egyptian vernacular rather than formal standard written Arabic. Haykal, son of rural land owners himself, had spent considerable time in France, where he was studying to be a lawyer, and it was actually at this point that he wrote Zaynab in 1911. Notably in the first publication, the author chose the pseudonym Masri Fallah (\"An Egyptian Rustic\"), which perhaps underlines the lack of prestige attached to the genre at the time of his writing."

  "text" : "Zadig ou la Destinée (Zadig, or The Book of Fate; 1747) is a novel and work of philosophical fiction by the Enlightenment writer Voltaire. It tells the story of Zadig, a philosopher in ancient Babylonia. The author does not attempt any historical accuracy, and some of the problems Zadig faces are thinly disguised references to social and political problems of Voltaire's own day. It was originally published as Memnon in Amsterdam (with a false imprint of London given) and first issued under its more familiar title in 1748. The book makes use of the Persian tale The Three Princes of Serendip. It is philosophical in nature, and presents human life as in the hands of a destiny beyond human control. Voltaire challenges religious and metaphysical orthodoxy with his presentation of the moral revolution taking place in Zadig himself. Zadig is one of Voltaire's most celebrated works after Candide. Many literary critics have praised Voltaire's use of contradiction and juxtaposition."

  "text" : "Zastrozzi: A Romance is a Gothic novella by Percy Bysshe Shelley first published in 1810 in London by George Wilkie and John Robinson anonymously, with only the initials of the author's name, as \"by P.B.S.\". The first of Shelley's two early, Gothic novellas, it outlines his atheistic worldview through the villain Zastrozzi and touches upon his earliest thoughts on irresponsible self-indulgence and violent revenge. An 1810 reviewer wrote that the main character \"Zastrozzi is one of the most savage and improbable demons that ever issued from a diseased brain.\" Shelley wrote Zastrozzi at the age of seventeen while attending his last year at Eton College, though it was not published until later in 1810 while he was attending University College, Oxford. The novella was Shelley's first published prose work."

Trudy Dixon and Richard Baker (Baker was Suzuki's successor) edited the talks by choosing those most relevant, arranging them into chapters. According to some, it has become a spiritual classic, helping readers to steer clear from the trappings of intellectualism. The book also exists as a 180-minute audiobook read by Peter Coyote and originally released on cassette by Audio Literature in March 1992."

Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.\"", "\"However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I'm doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until  -  flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground.  I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.\"", "In the middle of the night, the skull came to him in a dream and said, \"You chatter like a rhetorician and all your words betray the entanglements of a living man.  The dead know nothing of these!  Would you like to hear a lecture on the dead?\"  Zhuangzi said, \"Indeed.\"", "Zhuangzi and Huizi were enjoying themselves on the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, \"The minnows are darting about free and easy! This is how fish are happy.\"", "Cook Ding laid down his knife and replied, \"What I care about is the Way [Dao], which goes beyond skill.  When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself.  After three years I no longer saw the whole ox.  And now, now I go at it by spirit and don't look with my eyes.  Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants.  I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and follow things as they are.  So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.\"", "Huizi replied, \"You are not a fish. How do you know that the fish are happy?\" Zhuangzi said, \"You are not I. How do you know that I do not know that the fish are happy?\"", "\"Excellent!\" said Lord Wenhui.  \"I have heard the words of Cook Ding and learned how to nurture life!\"", "The emperor of the Southern Seas was Lickety, the emperor of the Northern Sea was Split, and the emperor of the Center was Wonton.  Lickety and Split often met each other in the land of Wonton, and Wonton treated them very well.  Wanting to repay Wonton's kindness, Lickety and Split said, \"All people have seven holes for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing.  Wonton alone lacks them.  Let's try boring some holes for him.\"  So every day they bored one hole [in him], and on the seventh day Wonton died.", "Huizi said, \"I am not you, to be sure, so of course I don't know about you. But you obviously are not a fish; so the case is complete that you do not know that the fish are happy.\"", "\"Ah, this is marvelous!\" said Lord Wenhui.  \"Imagine skill reaching such heights!\"", "When Zhuangzi went to Chu, he saw an old skull, all dry and parched.  He poked it with his carriage whip and then asked, \"Sir, were you greedy for life and forgetful of reason, and so came to this?  Was your state overthrown and did you bow beneath the ax, and so came to this?  Did you do some evil deed and were you ashamed to bring disgrace upon your parents and family, and so came to this?  Was it through the pangs of cold and hunger that you came to this?  Or did your springs and autumns pile up until they brought you to this?\"  When he had finished speaking, he dragged the skull over and, using it for a pillow, lay down to sleep.", "Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuang Zhou.  But he didn't know if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that he was Zhuang Zhou.  Between Zhuang Zhou and the butterfly there must be some distinction!  This is called the Transformation of Things.", "Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering about, happy with himself and doing as he pleased.  He didn't know that he was Zhuang Zhou.", "\"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped.\"", "Zhuangzi said, \"Let's go back to the beginning of this. You said, How do you know that the fish are happy; but in asking me this, you already knew that I know it. I know it right here above the Hao.\"", "The skull said, \"Among the dead there are no rulers above, no subjects below, and no chores of the four seasons.  With nothing to do, our springs and autumns are as endless as heaven and earth.  A king facing south on his throne could have no more happiness than this!\"  Zhuangzi couldn't believe this and said, \"If I got the Arbiter of Fate to give you a body again, make you some bones and flesh, return you to your parents and family and your old home and friends, you would want that, wouldn't you?\" The skull frowned severely, wrinkling up its brow.  \"Why would I throw away more happiness than that of a king on a throne and take on the troubles of a human being again?\" it said.", "Cook Ding was cutting up an ox for Lord Wenhui.  At every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee  -  zip, zoop!  He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the Dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Jingshou Music.", "Zhuangzi's wife died.  When Huizi went to convey his condolences, he found Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. \"You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,\" said Huizi. \"It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing &ndash; this is going too far, isn't it?\"", "\"A good cook changes his knife once a year  -  because he cuts.  A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month  -  because he hacks.  I've had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I've cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone.  There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness.  If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there's plenty of room  -  more than enough for the blade to play about it.  That's why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone.\"" ],

  "text" : "The Zhuangzi (pronounced [ʈʂu̯áŋ.tsɨ̀]) is an ancient Chinese text from the late Warring States period (476–221 BC) which contains stories and anecdotes that exemplify the carefree nature of the ideal Daoist sage. Named for its traditional author, \"Master Zhuang\" (Zhuangzi), the Zhuangzi is one of the two foundational texts of Daoism—along with the Dao De Jing (Laozi)—and is generally considered the most important of all Daoist writings. The Zhuangzi consists of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature. Its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from the human world and its conventions. The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad, large and small, life and death, and human and nature. While other philosophers wrote of moral and personal duty, Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with \"the Way\" (Dào 道) by following nature. Though primarily known as a philosophical work, the Zhuangzi is regarded as one of the greatest literary works in all of Chinese history, and has been called \"the most important pre-Qin text for the study of Chinese literature.\" A masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty to the present. Many major Chinese writers and poets in history—such as Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220), Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties (222–589), Li Bai during the Tang dynasty (618–907), and Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty (960–1279)—were influenced by the Zhuangzi."

It tells the story of Abdulrahman Zeitoun, the Syrian-American owner of a painting and contracting company in New Orleans, Louisiana who chose to ride out Hurricane Katrina in his Uptown home. After the hurricane, he traveled the flooded city in a secondhand canoe rescuing neighbors, caring for abandoned pets and distributing fresh water, but was arrested without reason or explanation at one of his rental houses, along with three others, by a mixed group of U.S. Army National Guard soldiers and local police officers. Zeitoun and the others were accused of terrorist activities, presumably because of the large amount of money found in their possession as well as maps of the city and a storage disc, and were detained for 23 days. Zeitoun was refused medical attention and the use of a phone to alert his family. His wife and daughters, who were staying with friends far away from the city, only learned that he had disappeared."

  "text" : "Z. Marcas is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first published in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist who is abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France. Balzac was inspired to write the story after he spotted the name \"Z. Marcas\" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One year later it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\"). Balzac later placed it in the Scènes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Comédie humaine. Although Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism – both hallmarks of Balzac's style – it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come. The story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Zhou (周).) Zhou Enlai (Chinese: 周恩来; Wade–Giles: Chou En-lai; 5 March 1898 – 8 January 1976) was the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976. Zhou served under Mao Zedong and was instrumental in the Communist Party's rise to power, and later in consolidating its control, forming foreign policy, and developing the Chinese economy. A skilled and able diplomat, Zhou served as the Chinese foreign minister from 1949 to 1958. Advocating peaceful coexistence with the West after the stalemated Korean War, he participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference and the 1955 Bandung Conference, and helped orchestrate Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. He helped devise policies regarding the bitter disputes with the U.S., Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India and Vietnam. Zhou survived the purges of other top officials during the Cultural Revolution. While Mao dedicated most of his later years to political struggle and ideological work, Zhou was the main driving force behind the affairs of state during much of the Cultural Revolution. His attempts at mitigating the Red Guards' damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in the Cultural Revolution's later stages. As Mao Zedong's health began to decline in 1971 and 1972, Zhou struggled against the Gang of Four internally over leadership of China. Zhou's health was also failing, however, and he died eight months before Mao on 8 January 1976. The massive public outpouring of grief in Beijing turned to anger towards the Gang of Four, leading to the Tiananmen Incident. Although succeeded by Hua Guofeng, it was Deng Xiaoping, Zhou's ally, who was able to outmaneuver the Gang of Four politically and eventually take Mao's place as paramount leader by 1978."

It was one of four books by Louis MacNeice to appear in 1938, along with The Earth Compels, I Crossed the Minch and Modern Poetry: A Personal Essay. Zoo is primarily a book about London Zoo. During the writing of the book, from May to August 1938, Louis MacNeice was living in Primrose Hill Road, London, in a maisonette overlooking Primrose Hill and a short distance from London Zoo. (In the last chapter of the book, MacNeice notes that: \"As I write this on Primrose Hill I can hear the lions roaring in the Zoo.\") According to the blurb on the flap of the dust jacket, Zoo \"contains impressions of the Zoo from a layman's point of view, and impressions of the visitors; information about the keepers and feeding of the animals (and visitors); discussion of the Zoo's architecture and general organisation; and special studies of animals.\" The book also contains descriptions of Whipsnade Zoo, Bristol Zoo and the new Paris Zoo in the Bois de Vincennes, together with a number of \"digressions\" - short descriptions of the lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, cricket matches at Lord's, and a week-end visit to Northern Ireland. Zoo is illustrated with drawings, mainly in carbon pencil, by the English artist Nancy Coldstream (later Nancy Spender), under her maiden name of Nancy Sharp. Nancy Coldstream had earlier provided illustrations for I Crossed the Minch, a book on the Hebrides by Louis MacNeice. Zoo was a Book Society Recommendation and, as Jon Stallworthy notes in his biography of Louis MacNeice, it \"sold well enough, though much less well than Modern Poetry.\""

It is threatened by habitat loss and introduced species. It has often been confused with the related B. madagascariensis, which is common in the aquarium trade. In addition to meristics, the two can be separated by the exact colour pattern on their tail fin (males of both typically have red in the tail) and the distinct red spot on the lower jaw of breeding male B. geayi (lacking in B. madagascariensis)."
